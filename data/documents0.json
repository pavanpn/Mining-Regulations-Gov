This petition is 100% unfair to all other international students who study \"not a Stem\" major. For all of the reasons people listed below mentioning that it's good for students to have longer practical training, then this petition should apply for \"ALL internationals students\". Otherwise, the petition only benefits for a very small group of us. I and my friends chose the U.S to study and have paid hundreds thousand dollar for the U.S government because we believe we are and will be given the same opportunities from the country(I say opportunities, not rights), but now it seems that the U.S government is considering to take away what brought us here from the beginning. Please reconsider the consequences to your economy as the U.S may be no longer a \"number one in list country\" which intl students will choose. \n\nFor whom who think that this benefit for high tech company and good for the economy because they need more people working in data field or CS field, for example. Not necessarily. I am studying Public Policy Analysis and I am confident to manipulate or analyze data like any other some Stem majors can. I and my friends even ask for lower salary than other CS majors people do. However, I can only have 12 months of OPT because my major is not listed in \"STEM\" majors. Dear everyone, you know that the name does not say it all, but how you know the tools and techniques matters. \n\nFor whom who say that I'm jealous of STEM people. I am applying to grad school and major in \"STEM\" just because I like it and it fits my dream. Even in the case when I get a STEAM major after I graduate, I will not support this petition no matter what because it is very unfair to all international students, to your peers. Imagine one day, there is a petition that give graduate students 48 months of practical training, what will you react?

Sure, the United States was a \"melting pot\" five hundred years ago, but in the 21st century, some of the \"ice cubes\" you're allowing to come here are not melting but are, instead, floating around on top of the citizenry, making unreasonable demands and generally showing complete disrespect for the American people, like me, who want to preserve OUR culture.\n\nMy family may have come to this country from somewhere else, but we've been here for so long that I cannot tell you what place that was and have absolutely no allegiance to any country but the U.S.  I am an American, not a hyphenated-American, whose allegiance is divided between at least two countries, in complete disregard to our immigration policy.    \n\nWe are called racist when we object to Mexican flags being flown on American streets by people who don't speak English and, therefore, will NEVER assimilate into our society.\n\nWe are called racist and heartless when we object to illegals who are illiterate in their own languages and speak no English invading public school classrooms and detracting from OUR children's educations.\n\nWe are called racist and heartless when we object to free medical care for people in this country illegally.  I would like one of you to explain to this citizen, whose family has been in this country since (at least) the 17th century, why you feel obliged to give these people free things that citizens have to pay out the nose to receive, like healthcare, education, housing, food.\n\nIt is incumbent upon you to represent the people already citizens of this country, stop pandering to illegals and stop telling us we need immigrants to fill jobs when there are, obviously, NO JOBS in this country for citizens or immigrants!  It's odd to me that American kids go in serious debt for their college educations and then can't find jobs when they graduate, but our colleges and universities are filled with foreigners from supposedly poor countries and you want us to believe we need these people to come here to fill jobs that could very well be filled by citizens, if only we could receive the necessary training!  Citizens first!\n\nMy daughter was born in Utah, lived there for 16 1/2 years; then we moved to Nevada, where she finished a year and a half of school and then went to college.  She didn't qualify for residency in Nevada and Utah wouldn't allow her to pay resident tuition either, so she had to pay out of state residency tuition for two years no matter where she chose to go to college -- BUT illegals can pick any university in the country and get resident tuition!  How is that reasonable?  \n\nI don't have a college education and would love to have it given to me, but you're not going to do that, are you?\n\nI need healthcare, but you're not going to give it to me, are you?\n\nI need a place to live, but you're not going to give it to me, are you?\n\nI need food to eat, but you're not going to give it to me, are you?\n\nI want a better life, but you're not going to give it to me, are you?\n\nI want to be able to survive, but my Social Security stipend is a joke -- I'd like to see the elitists in D.C. survive on $1000 a month!  If you were faced with that future, you'd do something about the theft of our social services money and OUR social security funds or at least realize that the \"entitlement\" spending that self-absorbed politicians (the real entitled) suggest is bankrupting this country is not being spent on citizens!  \n\nWhy on earth do you feel it's reasonable to give those things to people who are in this country illegally, who have thumbed their noses at our immigration and other laws, since they feel so much more privileged and who have absolutely no respect and complete disdain for the citizens of this country upon whose backs everything was built.\n  \nThe world, especially Mexico, is laughing at your ignorance and the fact that you sit by and do absolutely nothing while the United States of America is taken over by third world Latinos.  Is that your vision for America?  Does the world need another Latino country?  Does it need another Muslim nation filled with religious nut cases?  Do you want the culture of the United States of America to be gone forever, replaced by some other country's culture?  \n\nYou have a responsibility to the citizens of the United States of America, not people who are in this country illegally who want what we have and want YOU to give it to them, while ignoring the wishes of the people paying your salaries.\n\nWake up and stop the invasion, legal and illegal, or you will be responsible for contributing to the demise of the United States of America.

As the title of this proposal shows, all the eligible F-1 students will be beneficial from improving and expanding training opportunities in the U.S. Not only we can fully take advantage of this opportunity, but also as the students here we will also have more time contribute to the U.S. economy as thanks for everything we have learned in the United States. This is a win-win situation.\n\n2. The to be extended OPT-extension will attract more international students to come to U.S. to study. Which will increase the diversity and more people will be able to share thoughts, opinions and motivate creativity. \n\n3. Using the new extended time of working, students will get better understanding of what they are doing in the company and leverage what we learn to better help people around the world.\n\n4. F-1 students will have more time to stay with their friends, co-workers as we have built a very close relationship and would be so sad to leave them if without the new extended time. The extra time with professors, friends and mentor will be our long lasting memories in the whole life.\n\nTherefore, me, as a F-1 student, fully support this new rule and would love to know it will be passed.

However, I'd like to bring a couple of existing issues which have not been handled in the new rule and would request you to consider them as well while drafting the final rule.\n\n1) A student whose 17 month or 24 month STEM period ends before April of any calendar year still does NOT benefit  by the current extension or cap-gap clause because, H1-Bs are filed only after April and this extension still doesn't increase the number of chances a student gets to apply for an H1- B.\n2)  Most employers who hire STEM students are in favour of sponsoring H1-B visas to them but the quota for H1-Bs(for international students who study in USA) is still very low at 20,000 per year and that is where the real issue is: Students who fail to get picked in H1-B lottery enroll in a college again and spend money on additional degrees although unintended. So, requesting you to solve this issue by either increasing the H1-B count in THIS category or MODIFY the cap-gap rule so as to increase the number of chances a student could use to file for H1-B.\n\nI hope that the issues I mentioned are addressed in the final rule for STEM OPT.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nAnish Gupta","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0731","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anish Gupta"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Quote from Ron Hira of Howard University:\n\n\"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional.

Articles in the New York Times and on the ABC Evening News have recently and repeatedly shown stories on how companies are replacing their American workers with cheap foreign labor - then forcing the Americans to train their own replacements. \n\nLike I said, anyone who says there is a STEM labor shortage in the America is lying through their teeth, and an obvious shill for Big Business. The news proves it, the US Census data proves it, and the CEPR proves it. The May 2015 Monthly Labor Statistics provided by the US Government state there is a shortage of STEM jobs and a surplus of STEM workers.\n\nIf our own government acknowledges that there is a surplus of STEM workers, why in the Hell are we even thinking about increasing any visa allocation at all?\n\nThere are over 20 million Americans unemployed. Less than 50% of American STEM workers are employed in their own field and you want to EXPAND visa programs? That's insane! We need FEWER foreign workers taking American STEM job and STEM internships, not more. Let's get our American STEM workers back on the job! \n\nWe should reduce the number of ALL visas allowed, especially the H1-B and L1-B visas, but also the F1 visas - their current numbers are astronomical, and are a MAJOR reason why so many America STEM workers are not employed in their chosen field. \n\nReferences:\nhttp://www.cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/is-there-a-shortage-of-workers-in-stem-fields\nhttp://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-130.html\nhttp://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3341","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Olan Knight"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Getting a chance to have work experience for those international students is more than icing on the cake (US MS degree).

I recommend this time period because the nature of the work of the STEM students, especially students in the Engineering field. For example, students who work in Civil/Environmental/Electrical/Mechanical Engineering industry, will often be involved in projects that need years to be completed. In most cases the students' participation in these projects will be required from the initial design phase to the construction/execution phase as well as the measurement and verification phase. It's very common that a construction project will take 10 years to be completed. 3 years is far from enough for students to gain meaningful experience, achieve actual real results and make real contribution to the companies/organizations; since the initial training would take up a long time. It will be a waste of resource and time for both the companies and students if the students have to leave when the project just started and the students just have gotten familiar with the industry and the operations of the companies. The short of enough practice time is also a factor that lower the competitiveness of international students in the job market, since the employer would not want to invest in training employees that only have very limited amount of time here in the companies. To conclude, in order to achieve the the goal of OPT - giving international students the opportunities to gain real, meaningful, valuable training experience as well as bringing actual benefit to the U.S. companies, I think OPT for STEM students should be extended for 3 more extra years, making a total 6 years training period. \n\nThank you,\nQiuhua Lu","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2394","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Qiuhua Lu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"YES, STEM OPT should be extended to 24 months, but why ? One of the reasons why the U.S. is a powerful country is its diverse population and crucial contribution of its immigrant population to science, engineering and technology. Extension of 17 months of STEM OPT to 24 months is a win-win situation both for the U.S. and the international students studying in this great country. If the STEM OPT is not extended to 24 months, and even worse, if it will become less than 17 months, the U.S. will not be able to attract international students, or it will attract significantly less international students. Thus, there will be a significant decrease in number of students in the U.S. universities and the U.S. will experience the lack of qualified employees in science, engineering and technology related areas.

Any longer and it becomes employment. The proposal would make it possible to have a three year training, plus the potential for an additional two years if earning a second STEM degree at a higher education level\nThe safeguarding for US workers in related fields is extremely weak in the proposal. In fact, since the requirements are so low, they actually promote the hiring of OPT trainees instead, for which companies can pay \"trainee\" type wages (minimum wage). How could a US Citizen or Permanent Resident recent graduate expect to compete for this position while saddled with student debt?\nThe costs of the standards in the proposed rule of approximately $71.7 million dollars per year to facilitate the OPT 24 month extension could be much better allocated in the form of full scholarships to US citizens and Permanent residents to study in STEM fields reducing the US reliance on foreign labor in particular in fields of sensitive technology for national security reasons.\n       There is a terrible trend occurring. To illustrate, three Michigan Universities alone (U of M, MSU and Wayne State) provided close to a billion dollars in aid, tuition and teaching assistantships to foreign students in 2011. US and Permanent Resident students attend undergraduate classes and pay tuition that is then often redistributed to foreign grad students who have no student debt in the form of free tuition or teaching assistantships or other support. Only a small body of US citizen and permanent resident students graduate debt free and have the means to continue to grad school. There then exists a gap for which employers look to foreign labor to fill. \nInstead of helping the problem, the proposed rule will only make this cycle worse and hurt US Citizen and Permanent Resident students. The proposed rule will increase the number of foreign students applying to the universities (as appears to be one of the stated goals of the proposal), with the ultimate goal to obtain a job in the US. However, in consequence US Citizen and Permanent Resident students will be forced to attend lesser schools due to availability and competition, and face greater competition for work when they do graduate.\n        Any proposed rule should not be at the expense of those who are citizens and permanent residents. Twelve months of OPT for all foreign university students in the spirit of international exchange is a reasonable compromise to allow training that might be unavailable in the home country.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2597","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n \nI came to US because of its diversity, its embrace of intelligence, and its cutting-edge policies.

My knowledge could be greatly enhanced if I am able to continue a job in the field of computer science since the expertise I learnt at school is best for companies in U.S. Things in my country can be a bit different from what I've learned here. \n\nHaving a job for a while after I graduate is beneficial to both me and IT company since they are in great demand of work force with high education background. Yet there are some learning curve required in big companies for a newly graduated students like me to solve ambiguity, become familiar with company's internal structure and internal system and tools. Based on my internship experience, tools and systems that an employee needs to learn in IT companies is much more complicated compared with traditional industries. Because of this, the former OPT regulations, which provide one year of work authorization, might not be sufficient.  Within the one year provided, new employee would spend first couple of months to get started, and work efficiently afterwards. After one year, foreign student like me would need to return back to our country without establishing a concrete working experience, which is not the best for my career path after I returned back to my country. Companies who hired us, on the other hand, would need more employees with high education level every other year because of the vacancy. This whole process is inefficient for all groups involved. \n\nThis regulation, however, greatly solved this problem. It allows people who is still desired by companies to stay at their position longer. Because of this, I would have a solid background after I returned to my country. The company that hires me would have a dedicated employee who worked for them for a period of time they prefer.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers: the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n    \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO: \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n    \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n    \"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department: \"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n    \"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n    \"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n    \"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3809","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by William Whited"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully support this proposed new rule and view it as a great enhancement to the repealed 17-months extension rule.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jo bs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa has reminded the President that, \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. T he Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nAlso, John Miano, an attorney representing tech workers has reported that the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mento ring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n There is a Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis who responds, \"On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.  If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\n Also,Richard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO reminds us that, \"Expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\n\n\nThese comments and facts speak volumes as to why this and other measures like it are counter-productive to our country.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3479","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Denise Johnson"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Highly support this amended rule.

I completely support this amendment!\n\nIt is common knowledge that companies in STEM fields perennially face shortage of highly skilled employees, and suffer as a result of this dearth, which in turn affects the economy. There are over 5 million jobs in STEM \n(http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2014/02/05/report-stem-job-market-much-larger-than-previously-reported) \nand a lot of those go unfilled every year because of lack of skilled employees; there are just not enough US citizens who are able and willing to fill these positions. Over 4 million STEM jobs go unfilled each year (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real). Over 500,000 skilled positions are unfilled \n(http://www.cbsnews.com/news/three-million-open-jobs-in-us-but-whos-qualified/)\nThus OPT (and H1B) is not just an opportunity for students on F1 visa, it is an economic requirement of this country. For e.g. more than half of silicon valley workers are OPT and H1B workers, and the economy there is highly dependent on OPT and H1B workers. The same is true of many other economic and tech hubs in this country. Unfilled positions means billions of dollars lost (http://www.businessinsider.com/industries-with-unfilled-jobs-2014-11).\n\nGiven that H1B visas are limited in number and each year the number of applicants are high, there is a 1 in 3 chance of getting an H1B visa during one fiscal year. As a result, without the OPT extension, 2 out of 3 STEM workers would have had to leave the country, and work in another country and compete against us. This 24-month STEM extension provides a much needed relief for such workers, and a chance to apply for H1B in next fiscal year. In addition, OPT will also drive wages up, as STEM workers on OPT have a much better flexibility of changing jobs, and a much better opportunity of wage increase. The sheer requirement of high-tech workers drives wages up (http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/05/10-h1b-visas-stem-rothwell-ruiz).\n\nThis amendment is an example of good and timely action taken by DHS to improve upon the court ruling, and if implemented, would be a great economic boost to this nation, as well provide much needed relief to thousands of students currently on OPT. I wholeheartedly support this amendment.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2069","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anshul Joshi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As one out of perhaps only 200 internaitonal dentists in studying in  a dentistry program on a student visa I request you to add DMD and DDS to the STEM degree list and help healthcare professionals like us serve the rural population.

Immigrants are in almost every leading industry of America, from Silicon Valley to Hollywood, from sports to Wall Street. \n\nBringing the greatest minds, regardless of where they are from. America's openness and freedom in technology towards most talented people over the world, is one important factor that this country has become, and is maintaining the leader of the world for science and technology. First railway, first computer, first atomic bomb, first moon landing... foreigners are behind every influential projects of this country, making their contributions. America has selected them, and they have selected to become American.\n\nForeigners are making contribution to America's STEM industry. Many talented people in STEM fields are not born in this country. Elon Musk, founder of Uber, is from South Africa. CEO of Google and Microsoft are from India. One founder of Garmin GPS is from Taiwan. Even though a large percentage of talented founders and senior managers of outstanding companies are Americans, many of them are still born and raised in immigrant families. The intelligence reserve is a significant factor of core competence for a nation. If we are thinking of this country's future, it is better to attract more smart, foreign students to work and live in United States.\n\nMany Americans are concerned, about the competition of foreign workers brings to local job market. I would like to say, based on my own experience in job seeking, foreign students confront much more restriction and limitation. When applying for technical roles, we face a much higher hiring bar. Almost all tech-related jobs that are filled by foreign students are because of the real need in the market that can not be filled with local students. As an example of IT industry, Facebook, Google, Apple, Uber all have launched recruitment in China and India, giving direct sponsorship for selected employee in those countries. Sponsorship is not cheap, companies are willing to pay more, simply because the companies believe those employees are smarter, deliver better work and better fit for the opportunities and roles. We are not simply taking the jobs away, we are creating jobs and making a better future.\n\nThe need is there, and we need to solve it. That is why we need the OPT extension.\n\nIt is true that there are some companies that targeting the current loopholes and filing more H1b applications for oversea workers, paying them at a low wage. American people blame them for taking jobs away. Yes but that is totally different from the OPT extension we are discussing. Realistically, if OPT extension is revoked, tens of thousands of foreign employees will be forced to leave after just a year of their starting date, and companies are forced to launch new recruiting process. This brings economic harm to those companies. More adversely, those companies will hesitate when they hire foreign new-grads next time. But since the need is still there, there will still be gap of smart workers in STEM fields. \n\nI watched the republican presidential candidate debate not too long ago. One of them raised a point which I can't agree more. \"Ironically, America might be the only country which it is controversial to say 'secure the border'.\" In my opinion, what is more ironic is that America is friendly to those undocumented immigrants with no jobs or low-end jobs, but is taking away STEM-related workers who are not only decent tax payers, but also real future value creators for the country.\n\nTherefore, for the bright future, and for the justice and equal opportunity of all people in this country, please pass the OPT-extension rule!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2142","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jiaju Shen, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support this act based on two reasons.

It helps greedy multinational corporations at the expense of our children and grandchildren, our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives. There is NO Shortage of STEM workers in the United States. There instead is a drastic shortage of corporations like Apple and Microsoft who are willing to hire American workers, pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on their behalf, and pay them decent salaries. In my region - the Pacific Northwest - Microsoft routinely fires STEM workers and replaces them with cheap labor via OPT and the HIB visa program. They then house these foreign workers in dormitories. Our country cannot afford to discard American workers in favor of cheap foreign labor just because these damned corporations have bought politicians and our political system. It is a disgrace and this proposed rule would make a bad situation even worse. Shame on all of you who are trying to shove this dastardly rule through!\n\nAccording to the Center for Immigration Studies, the current OPT program denied more than 430,000 jobs to young Americans between 2009 to 2013. This stupid corporate welfare program also cost our Social Security and Medicare system more than Four Billion Dollars during that period. That is a travesty.\n\nHere's what I think you should do. Open all DHS jobs - including yours - to foreign students and foreign workers. All  of you can then go to work for Wal-Mart and move back into mom and dad's basement! That is exactly what you are doing to young and older Americans. If you like this b.s. so much, subject yourselves to it. Oh Wait. You will not do that, will you!\n\nMy grandson is a STEM student right now at the University of Washington. He is - in his sophomore year - an honor student taking calculus and physics. Do you want to tell him and our family his efforts are worthless because you are going to make sure the job he might have had will instead be given to a cheap foreign laborer by his own government? Shame on you for proposing this rule. \n\nDo the Right Thing. Pull this proposal. Reduce the OPT program and start being an advocate for our own children and grandchildren. \n\nVery Disrespectfully Yours,\nSue Robinson\n306 N.

There are couple of suggestions regarding the application of rule for existing students on OPT Extension.\n\n1. Making it mandatory to apply before 120 days of end of 17 months extension would result in many students becoming ineligible to take advantage of the rule and thus void to great extent the original purpose of this rule. Instead I believe giving such students a chance to again apply for remaining 7 months of extension within 60 days ( Time given to them to leave US) after the 17 month extension has expired would end up giving more students if not all, a better prospect to take advantage of this rule. They still wont be able to work as work permit has expired but they can legally stay like in the case of cap-gap and wait for their renewed EAD card.\n\n2. For certain students in CAP-GAP (With EAD expiring before 1st April) work authorization should be provided as they have a employer filling their H1B but they have to wait till Oct 1st (If there H1 is apporved) to start working or resume working. This makes cap-gap not that effective. If a student is considered a highly skilled labor then making that labor sit idle for 6 or more months is not fruitful to any involved parties. I believe if the employer of such students (who have their EAD expiring no earlier then 60 days (time for them to leave US ) before 1st April (Date of H1B filing)) is providing consent to file H1 for that student then such students should be provided with a extended work authorization till Oct 1st (H1B status start date provided they were approved).\n\nOnce again I would like to thank DHS and all the employees of USCIS that work so hard to provide many students like me all the help and support to overcome this tedious task of maintaining legal status in this land of free.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1486","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Mohit Pillay"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a great initiative.

Most of them obtained the H1B work visa by taking advantage of STEM OPT. Instead of pushing STEM student back to home country, the U.S. should provide better environment to them.

I am aware of someone, whom I have known for many years now, who would be personally affected by changes brought on by alterations to the STEM OPT extension. This young man has proven himself to be an excellent student and an ambitious, diligent, and dedicated worker throughout his entire time here. As I have come to know him, I can honestly say he is nothing short of an invaluable asset, one that we cannot afford to lose. It is disheartening and disconcerting to think that we would be willing to allow someone with such talent and tremendous competence to leave our shores. If we are to remain a nation of extraordinary capability we must retain these young students of extraordinary capacity. We should be nurturing and training such individuals to stay and work here so they may add to the ingenuity, expertise, and success of our great land. In an increasingly competitive world, we would be woefully remiss to let gems that have been polished by our very own institutions enrich foreign countries instead of our own. It would be nothing short of detrimental if were to fail in retaining the precious resources we have cultivated. \n\nAlthough the argument for the continuation of the STEM OPT extension may simply seem to be a matter of losing raw talent, we must not overlook the inestimable social costs these students will have to bear if the extension is not granted. I am sure that in addition to the student I have mentioned in particular there will be many others who will also have to face separation from their families who live here. These students will have to suffer the burden of this unimaginable toll simply due to the lack on an extension, despite having the ambition and drive to succeed here in the United States. \n\nWe must do whatever we can to foster talent and intelligence here on our own soil, and making sure that the STEM OPT extension continues is a duty to which we must oblige.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0590","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Umair Javaid"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I used to work at the GE plant in Erie PA. At one point, we needed to hire an engineer to develop a new engine control system. I was on the hiring team for that position. HR presented us with 6 potential candidates, ALL foreigners, all MS graduates looking for OPT or H1B.  We had in house a resume from an American with all of the qualification who had relevant internship experience. When I asked why he was not in the pool of candidates, I was hushed up. \n\nThe American candidate was not even considered for the position. OPT/H1B folks work cheaper, and will work 70+ hours per week to get their foot in the door. This is all about cheap labor, not about \"best and brightest\". \n\nDuring the years I worked at GE, I saw many Americans, mostly white males over 40, get let go, as many foreign workers were brought in. One of the Indian \"leased employees\" I worked with was working over 70 hours per week said he was paid $20k/yr. \n\nThese foreign worker programs need to be stopped cold, not expanded. Asa former electrical engineer, I would not counsel any young person to enter any technical field because of these visa programs and the way corporations abuse them. \n\nPlease do not expand ANY foreign worker programs, our young people need these opportunities.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3480","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Vince Dunsworth"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Support!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0707","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Holly Deng"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Yes, I really liked this new rule to be inforced.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2209","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Nikhil More"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The first year for most of the STEM student working under their OPT program is to receive training from their companies.

STEM beneficiaries also have the liberty to change the employers while H1 visa holder do not have any such benefits even though he has problems with his employer which will make them more care free changing their jobs which might become problem for H1 visa holder who cannot shift his employer as easily as the STEM holder.\n\n3). More than half the STEM beneficiaries do not work in the area they graduated as their is no one who will check on which area they are doing the work..Most of the foreign nationals especially Indians work in different areas than the area they got the degree from or else they will just pay some money to unethical employers and get a letter mentioning they work for that employer and  get the approval for STEM extension and later they work illegally in Gas stations,Grocery stores etc..\n\n4). Few months back there was another rule which got implemented to give Work permit for certain category of H4(Dependent) Visa holders now this new rule..According to initial figures there are around 180000 persons who are eligible for working...If I am not wrong not even 10% of the that number would have entered into any Job..Personally I know lot of people who are in this Visa category searching for Jobs but not getting any opportunities so if this new rule gets implemented than what justice that the other Visa holders would get?\n\n5).America is land of dreams for many nations so there is no question to think that if STEM program beneficiaries are not allowed to stay in the country this country will not progress...Every Year new blood comes into the nation and out of which who have the merit to stay in the country will stay and the rest will go back but with this new rule lot of undeserved and unethical people will stay in America which in turn makes America not a land of dreams for future generations which could be a serious threat to the country in future years.\n\nThere are lot more problems with this rule but I want to stop here..................PLEASE STOP THIS RULE\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1180","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by John H."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n\n\"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers. The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.\n\nFinally, the Regulations fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regulation, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for fraud leaves the victimized American still goes without proper compensation.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3712","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by William Harrison"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"That would be good for the students as they can gain more experience in their filed.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2043","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sai Krishna"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think it is necessary to extend OPT program because right now H1b visa is very difficult to get.

By allowing F1 students more time to work for USA, these students can devote their time and passion to work for companies and utilize their knowledge to make profits for these companies. Without the OPT extension, USA would loss a tremendous invaluable human resources. This would definitely impede the economy and impair the development of technology.\n\nSecond, for companies, they can hire F1 students to help them grow their business. It would be a great loss for the company if they can't hire an ideal candidate only because that candidate can't extend his/her OPT. \n\nThird, for students, they have more time to work in the industry and utilize their strengths to gain more experiences. With these experiences, they can pursue a better career path and have more chance to be successful in their career. \n\nBased on these three reasons, I strongly support the expanding for Training Opportunities for F1 students!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2807","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Tina Wu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Extending the optical training is a win-win choice, it should be passed.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1804","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Lu Yu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"10/29/2015 \n\nMs. Katherine Westerlund\n\nPolicy Chief (Acting)\n\nStudent and Exchange Visitor Program\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n500 12th Street SW\n\nWashington, DC 20536\n\nRe:Comments on Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated (or will graduate) in 2014 with a masters degree in the field of Computer Science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths.The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2988","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Goutham Kumar Chidhara"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If a company is hiring people by making use of their skills that were built during the school, then since foreign students also developed the skill sets that can be valuable for the company, they should have the same working opportunities.

This 24-month STEM OPT extension will not only benefit all the F1 students,  but also bring lots of benefits to the U.S.\n\nFirst of all, the development of America benefits a lot from diversity. This extension will encourage more talented international students in different majors to choose US instead of other countries. And they will be more likely to stay here to make contribution directly to US once they graduate with this extension.\n\nSecond, the current OPT has only 12 months, which is too short and unreasonable. Generally speaking, the new hire need time to be trained to be experienced and skillful and then they can have good impact in work. 12 months is absolutely not long enough for companies to wait for the good return from the new hire. The cost to train a new hire, not only in the terms of money, but also in terms of time, is so much. This may lead to that all the technology companies won't choose to hire new graduate. Thus, 12 months are equal to 0 month. Meanwhile, the limited human resources will slow down the innovation and development of those critical areas, thus slow down the whole development of US.\n\nMoreover, if this rule is not approved, STEM OPT will short from 29 months to 12 months, which is a huge huge huge change. This will break the career plan of so many international employees, and also has really bad influence on the development of related companies. \n\nIn a word, this 24 month extension is good and necessary. Why don't approve this win-win rule? \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1260","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Lu Cai"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm an international student and do think this extension will help me and give me more opportunities to contribute my skills to the place needed.

In short, it will further encourage wage discrimination against U.S. citizens because of flagrant abuse of the existing H1-B program.\n\nDiscussion:\nForeign STEM workers are commonly used to dilute the market value of U.S. citizens with STEM skills and experience, improving corporate profitability by manipulating government policies instead of their own business practices.\n\nAs documented extensively and readily available via Internet search, the H1-B program is currently the main vector of this end-run around immigration and labor law.  Expanding the loopholes to F-1 visa holders will compound the problem while avoiding the toxic political fall-out of raising the statutory limit of H1-B imports.\n\nU.S. policies must benefit U.S. citizens first, last, and always.  This program has no obvious or direct benefit to the American people although the benefit to a narrow range of businesses operating in America is obvious.   \n\nSummary:\nThis proposed rulemaking must not be adopted.  \n\nIt is misguided and damaging to the economic well-being of the U.S. public.  It favors a narrow slice of corporations operating at the expense of the American people who are deprived employment due to wage discrimination.

During my OPT, I involved in several research projects to study and develop state-of-the-art numerical algorithms using advanced mathematics to solve computationally intensive, stochastic dynamical problems, which not only contributed to the field of real industry development in U.S., but also led to publications in top-ranking journals and conferences in the field of computational mathematics.\nThe recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. Especially for me, this experiential learning will give me opportunities to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom and research lab with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3806","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sherry Xiao"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPT is important for international students, 24 months for STEM students is more reasonable, as the relative curriculum is hard and need more dedication.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations.

He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them.

This helps graduate students to use their valuable technical skills in the development of companies which in-turn is a development for the country. This new rule will also help Employers to retain the skill that is gained by employees in the 1st 17 months for an extended period of time instead of investing in hiring a new employee after 17 months and spending money to get the employee up to speed. \nOther Advantage is that, H1b quota which is being over filled with numerous applications every year will be reduced to a considerable limit as companies will be applying for H1b visa for OPT students only towards the end of 24 month OPT period in order to retain the employee.

OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\nThe proposed OPT rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.\"\n\"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\nDHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n\"One of the big education pushes in the United States is to increase STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education and create a workforce better suited to the jobs available in the modern era. Even schools that are not dedicated STEM schools are pushed to increase their STEM education, and other communities have gotten together to create STEM initiatives to supplement education.\"\nDHS' proposed rule \"is pushing the ones raised and trained AT HOME out of the job market that we created these education initiatives for and hands those jobs to students who have no ties to the U.S. other than their education.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3362","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Randy LaBounty"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I agree that the OPT should  have an extension of 24months","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0969","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Zhigang Wang "},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is important for international student as well as American companies.

My understanding is that Barack Obama attempted and force his own socialist agenda by not allowing the American people to comment on this issue.\n\nLet me make myself clear that no foreigner deserves a better job or better pay in this country than an American does. Surely there are high-tech workers who are Americans that can fill these positions? So why give outsiders preferential treatment?\n\nIt is unfortunate that our leadership has chosen to take this route, and it is a slap in the face to every educated American who is struggling to find adequate work in today's economy. \n\nWe saw what happened on 9/11 when foreigners had access to our educational system, namely our nations flight schools. They were first to enter this nation without really raising a red-flag, and then they were able to use one of our flight schools to learn to fly a plane. These men were Islamic terrorists who intended to do harm to the people of this nation.\n\nNow our so-called leadership wants to bring in thousands of Islamic people from Syria, and distribute these people all throughout our nation virtually unchecked, and unverified. How many of these people have already been trained in terrorism camps? If anything we should be making it more difficult for foreign students, and other foreigners to come into this country under any circumstance.\n\nObama will undoubtedly tie the hands of the immigration and naturalization, and customs agents, so that they will not be able to properly screen and profile these so-called refugees being brought into our country, and settled in our cities and towns. This is a recipe for disaster in my opinion, and our people will pay the price in the long run for our leaders stupidity.\n\nWhy bring potential terrorists and put them in place of American workers? \n\nWhat is there to profit except more Democratic Votes? \n\nThis entitlement mentality has gone way overboard in this country, and all the low-information people want more free stuff from the Government, and these Islamic invaders will come demanding free food, jobs, and accommodations just like they demanded in Europe. \n\nNO preference for foreign workers! Foreign Students! Or any outsider that does not belong here, or does not respect the laws of this nation, our flag, and those who have given all defending our freedom.\n\nThank you.\n\nK.D.

This restrictive policy helped make the United States the worlds preeminent technological power.\n\nThe current policy has a very different purpose.  It is to open the doors to unlimited immigration of people the majority of whom have (for their job classifications) average or below average ability.  This will surely boost the profits of tech CEOs with business models based on large numbers of low-wage workers, but it will drive away the best minds.  Albert Einstein never expressed a desire to move to Bangladesh now did he?\n\nImmigration reform wont just drive away the best minds from other countries; it will do so at home as well.  As job prospects in science and engineering continue to stagnate and decline, more and more of the hardest-working and most talented Americans (including the descendents of recent immigrants) will gravitate to protected fields such as medicine.  There is nothing wrong with medicine attracting good people, but if only losers who cant get into medical school do science and engineering, well, how is that improving the quality of American science and engineering? \n\nImagine a big research university.  To improve it should both support current faculty and also work hard to recruit the best talent from outside.  Suppose that this University simply hired all external applicants without limit or discrimination, and divided up the existing funds for salaries and lab and office space.   Before too long the faculty would be crowded and poor, and anyone with any real talent would have left.  As with a University, so with a nation: it can happen here.\n\nOf course a University  or a corporation, or a nation  can grow, but always mindful of the available opportunities and resources.  Dumping an additional ten thousand engineers into a company that only has need for a thousand will NOT instantly cause this companys business income to grow enough to pay for them.  Thats ridiculous.  So is the notion that bringing in more average-level scientists and engineers, when we dont have enough jobs for the ones we have already, will magically improve our industries and create more than enough wealth to cover the living expenses for them and their extended families.  Not gonna happen.\n\nI strongly urge that we limit, instead of expand, the ability of foreign nationals to move here and take jobs from Americans, at all skill levels.  I propose that we go back to the traditional American policy of picking and choosing the BEST from around the world, instead of simply flooding the market with mediocrities so that the sociopathic CEO of Facebook can have armies of drones writing mindless web apps and paying them chump change.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3243","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Timothy Gawne"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please implement this rule but allow Students who are on 17 month extension to take advantage of 6 more months without paying for it.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2601","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Pradeep Kilaru"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I unequivocally support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months.

This valuable experience in addition to the 12 month regular OPT can help them think more practically and possibly attain a better position in a firm when they go back to their home country considering having not got lucky with the H1B work visa . \n\n2 Considering the H1B work visa being lottery based , every student on F-1 student visa would prefer to have as many chances as possible to try their luck in the lottery , So by extending the STEM OPT to 24 months from the initial 17 month period it just satisfies the purpose mentioned above .\n\n3 Most International students who come on F-1 visa to the US to study have huge amounts of education loans to pay back once they graduate . This extension just possibly helps them in all ways to possibly repay back and either work in the U.S or go back to their home country debt free .\n\n4 I also feel considering the lottery based system of the h1b work visa the DHS and the U.S govt can take steps forward to either possibly increase the STEM EXTENSION by another 12 months to 36 months which makes it a total of 48 months taking the regular OPT into consideration OR possibly increase the quantity of h1b visas given out every year , both in the regular category < 65000 as of now > as well as in the advanced degree category <20000 as of now >  OR possibly have two intakes of h1b filing every year keeping the number of visas given out the same .\n    \n5 Lastly , This particular move of EXTENSION possibly gives the Unites states a competitive edge globally over other nations in terms of attracting International students to pursue education in the U.S and help them gain valuable practical experience in the field of their choice.\n\nWell these are just my personal opinions and it is upto the people in the authority to  make decisions .\n\nThanking the U.S govt and DHS for giving me an opportunity to comment .  \n\n               ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1269","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anish Nair"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am totally in favor of the extension of OPT for 24-month, STEM students are more free to look for a job which they like and offer the students an opportunity to apply what they learned in practice.

The Optional Practical Training (OPT) program has numerous problems:\n\n(1) OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013;\n(2) OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds;\n(3) The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program;\n(4) There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers;\n(5) OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year;\n(6) This program poses a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in December, 2014 with a Master's degree in the field of Computer Science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \n\nThe proposal to re-institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and accomplishing through experience. Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application.Establishing goals and a professional road-map at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished.\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule-making. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nChanging temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nVeera Paruchuri","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2975","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Veera Paruchuri"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly agree with the cost benefits analysis of the proposed extension program. I think it will help create more jobs in the long run. I also believe that it DHS should add additional checks to ensure that its programs are not misused.\n\nMy first recommendation is that DHS should consider making the extension applicable to students from Accredited and Public/Non-Profit colleges.  So that it does not create wrong incentives for profit oriented schools to recruit more students by promoting their educational programs as employment programs. DHS should consider using the same list of college as the H1-B advanced degree quota.\n\nMy second concern is about efficiency of mentoring program in a consulting situation. The proposed employer mentoring and training program may not be work in a consulting type work arrangement where the hired OPT student does not works directly with the employer but is working for a client in a remote location. DHS should include how the mentoring program will work in such situations.\n\nThirdly, I believe that DHS should make the proposed checks applicable to all OPTs. The proposed checks and safeguards should also apply to the first 12 months of OPT and OPTs issues in college to maintain continuity. The mentoring and training program should apply to all STEM OPT programs.\n\nLastly, the assumptions used to assess the impact on current employment in \"Regulatory Impact Analysis OPT STEM - October 2015\" document are not complete. The impact of the OPT extension cannot be looked at it by itself. It should also include the impact of all prior OPTs issued to the student including OPTs issued when in college. The more students US attracts because of the proposed extension, will also result in higher OPTs issued for the first 12 months and also OPTs issued in college. I strongly believe that with the right assumptions, the percentage of STEM OPT students in STEM employment population will be significantly more than 0.19 percent.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2359","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello \n\nAs an international student currently pursuing masters in information systems I feel this rule change will is a  beneficial and definitely a welcoming gesture towards a lot of international students with STEM degrees. Students like me have decided to pursue their higher studies in the united states not just because of the high quality of education here but also because of the high standard of work expected from an employee. Getting that opportunity to work for an employer and to be able to put the skills acquired in my education in the practical work sphere is  something which is Beneficial not just to the students but also to the employer to expand their talent base and diversity in the work environment. \n\nHowever in the recent times a lot of U.S employers have shown reluctance towards hiring  F1 student simply because of the work regulations that they have and are looking more inclined towards hiring people with H1 visas. It is in this context that i would like to suggest that the wording pertaining to the proposed mentoring and training program be  the proposed rule be looked into and maybe come up with a wording which doesn't sound negative for the employers. The current wording suggest additional work for an employer and doesn't necessarily inspire confidence for the employers to look out for the talent base from F1 students. A really useful and capable student can miss out on the opportunity to contribute towards his own growth and probably working towards making the organization better since the employer feels that it is too much a hassle in the hiring and development of a F1 student with no guarantee of a work visa such as H1 guaranteed. \n\nAn employer hiring usually looks at a candidate from a long term perspective and expects results from the candidate. But the current wording indicates more towards an employer having to use their other resources towards a F1 Student without any assurance of returns in the long term. This might cause the employers to be reluctant to hire Graduates which would effectively defeat the purpose of this rule. If employers are not encouraged towards hiring F1 students the whole rule would be obsolete no matter if it 17 months or 24 months.\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2404","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Dinesh Mandadi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"STEM is one of the primary reasons a lot of us, international students, decided to pursue higher education in the U.S. Having paid a full tuition, this is the only mean for a lot of students to gain experience and gain the funds spent.

I have nothing against OPT/H1B visas but DHS should check the misuse of OPT visas and H1B visas done by the consultancies/employers.\n\nMassive visa fraud is happening in the broad day light done by Indian consultancies. These so called Indian employers fake their resume and select candidates who are in OPT claiming that they have H1B visa. They run fake pay rolls and hire mostly Indian grads from US universities who can't even speak proper English. These so called consultancies get projects from companies(subcontracted by them) by showing that they have a very strong experienced workforce with 5-10 years experience. Most of the interviews with contractors are done through Skype and questions are answered by an experienced guy who will be on loudspeaker during the interview. While the actual candidate will lip sync to proxy candidate's reply to interviewers questions. Companies have hired thousands of fake candidates like this and some of them got fired. Consultancies/employers will lose that job contract as a result of this. But they will continue doing this as a candidate with US degree is their cash cow. These companies won't do background check properly and a person with a fake profile joins them. Within a span of 1 month they will be caught and kicked out. Some lucky ones stay there with the help of skilled proxies. These fake candidates will share their laptop screens with proxy worker sitting in India and get this work done. There are lots of fraudulent practices happening without the notice of officials and the industry.\n\nRecent examples are raids conducted by DHS on couple of Indan IT consultancy firms based in California and New Jersey. They arrested some Indian entrepreneurs who ran fake pay roll and employed candidates with fake experience. If you check the number of H1B visa applications you will realize the shocking number of applications that were duplicated by these con men. \n\nWithin a year, the H1B applications will overflow to 300,000 numbers because most of these consultancies will put 3-4 applications to get their H1B selected. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and other companies that apply for more than thousands of H1 visa applications should be investigated as such companies employ less than 30 percent American citizens. \n\nAs an American citizen, I am fed up of these consultancies and fake candidates. Because of their fraudulent activities many companies don't trust Indian graduates. It's become a stereotype that an Indian students always cheats in exams, fakes their resume and get jobs which should be given to genuinely experienced candidates.\n\nThis brain drain concept is completely ridiculous. I don't believe that USA as a great country needs foreign graduates to save economy or future of this country. Most of the foreign students especially Indian and chinese are here to make money and they don't come here to create jobs or create intelligent kids to save United States. It's a shame that United States as a great country can't control such frauds from taking advantage of this system. Please do a thorough investigation on such people and make OPT rules strict to prevent such malpractices by consultancies. \n\nIt is also important to save American jobs for American people. I would like to recommend that any employer should call foreign graduates only after they have interviewed a specific number of American candidates to make sure that the priority is given to American citizens. Please do the needful to stop these fraud Indian consultancies. Rather than giving OPT visas to all students who graduate here in USA, you should implement a system where students with good academic credentials directly benefit from system. Those who fake their credentials should be punished by cancelling the OPT and deporting them back to where they came from. \n\nPlease strictly enforce OPT visa holders to work in their corresponding fields they have their degrees based on. Recently, I have noticed that many of the mechanical engineering grads started working with these IT consultancies with fake profile and fake experience. Please take necessary steps to avoid such issues in future. Please stop them from changing companies during the OPT period. This will make sure that those who fake resumes to join a company will pay the price eventually. Stop graduates working with fake experience and taking away American jobs!! \n\nTo avoid faking resumes and profiles by these con artists, I hereby request DHS to enforce background check rules on these candidates before they even start their jobs. If you don't take care of concerns raised by American workers like me eventually this rule will be thrown out by another judge in the court. So I hope you'll address my concerns to implement a strong rule to avoid such fraudulent activities by foreign graduates and Indian consultancies. \"\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2061","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DHS, \n\nThank you for letting us post our feedback about the OPT/STEM proposed rule. I hope my feedback will be taken into consideration.\n\nToday, I would like to shed some light on students and their employers misusing OPT/OPT STEM Extension in the present IT world.\n\nI'm currently on H1-B visa and also hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from a State School. During my Master's program, I worked for an American Company on an Internship (CPT) and right after my graduation I had about 3 offers from American Tech IT Giants. I'm one among those lucky ones to be a part of a reputed company. \n\nHere is the most important part about my feedback - While I was working as an Intern (on CPT Work authorization), I had other students working along side me on the same project from various companies. The sad part however is these guys were all on OPT and projected themselves as Senior candidates with 7-8 years of IT Experience. At the least they weren't able to speak proper English during Weekly/daily stand up meetings. \nAt that time in 2011 as an Intern, I was making around $26 an hour for the same job with better skills and these guys were making roughly around $60/hr. I don't have have a problem with these guys making good money BUT I feel there are other well deserved candidates missing out on good opportunities due to lack of process background verification process by Government Agencies while issuing OPT/STEM Extension permits.\nThe worst part of all is that some of these students had graduated from non-IT fields such as Environmental Engineering, Mechanical and Bio-Chemistry and yet they have been successful at getting into IT with 7-8 years of experience and with ease. This is just the starting point for them, from here they work with so called \" Indian Consulting firms\" aka body shops to get their H1-B and Green Card process filed and try to stay ahead in the PERM process than the actual talent who's still struggling to make progress in their career with the right experience (not faking it). \n\nI would like to end this here with a humble request to the DHS: \n1. Please enforce a proper system to perform appropriate background checks on every Graduate student at the time of applying for OPT and specially during their STEM Extension process.  \n2. Kindly verify if the student applying for a STEM Extension is working in their area of study. It's sad to see an Engineer from an Environmental Engineer background working on an IT Cloud platform while this guy knows only about Cloud, weather and rain in the sky. \n3. There are lot of Consulting firms (Indian IT body shops) in every major city in the U.S. (specially in New Jersey, Texas and California) that are fooling the government agencies by running fake payrolls, generating fake experience letters while applying for H1-B and Perm. Please enforce stringent guidelines/regulations on such Companies. \n\nThank you for providing the Opportunity and God Bless America!\n\n\n\n \n\n      \n\n      \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2161","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Venkat K."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I agree on improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees.

I believe it should be extended to 24 months. The extension would be beneficial to all that are involved, which are; the students, U.S. employers, the economic sector, and the educational system. If this proposed extension becomes successful, STEM students would gain more experience during their OPT period due to the additional time. STEM students are limited to a time period of seventeen months to achieve both theoretical and practical knowledge in their specified fields. Time extension would be beneficial to the students in that they will be knowledgeably equipped to practice in their home countries. Also, this would give them more time to spend with their families, and the numerous friends they have made over the years. \nFurthermore, the extension would also be beneficial to the U.S. employers. This is because, majority of international students that come to the U.S. to study are in the STEM fields. STEM students tend to provide valuable skills to employers. In an educational research article by Neil Ruiz, he pointed out that \"collectively the STEM fields accounted for 37 percent of all F-1 visa approvals, compared to 27 percent overall\". \nhttp://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/geography-of-foreign-students#/M10420 . Employers benefit a lot from the skills of STEM OPT students. Some opposing arguments suggest that giving STEM OPT students more time to work in the U.S. will displace American workers. This argument can be countered because it is illegal for an employer to terminate or layoff any eligible U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to an F-1 student. \nAlso, STEM students contribute to the United States economy by providing assistance to scientific research professionals. They use their skills to develop new technologies which are used in different institutions in the country, and they also help to improve existing technologies. All these are beneficial to the U.S. economy. Allowing them more time to explore in their different fields would give them more time to give back to the country that has impacted so much knowledge in them. \nIn addition, this will also benefit the U.S. educational system by attracting more international students to the STEM field. People back home would feel more encouraged to come study in the U.S. because they believe they would be given quality opportunity to learn and explore. This in turn would benefit the U.S. educational system by pumping more money into the system. I was an international student, and I know how much I spent out of pocket in the course of my undergraduate education. My family back home was willing to invest all that money in me because they wanted me to get the best education. International students pay all their tuition out of pocket. An international student's tuition for just a semester would cover a U.S. citizen's tuition for at least two years in college. International students contribute hugely to the educational system, not just by bringing in their diverse cultures to spice up things for the American students, but also they financially assist in the continuous growth of the school system. Hence, if their needs are not met, that would be so discouraging to the ones back home who have the intention of coming to America to study. \nIn an article by NAFSA, it was noted that \"886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during 2013-2014 academic year\". \nhttp://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/. Extending the STEM OPT to 24 months would benefit the students and the United States economy/ educational system. So I believe it would be a win-win situation for everyone if this proposal becomes successful.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3144","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Irene Anyanwu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months!\nThis will not only help the students working on STEM OPT but it will also help their US employers. \nThe rule should be made applicable to both the future and current STEM OPT students!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2533","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Bhagyashree K."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Our family is against this proposed new rule.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n\nThe OPT cannot be justified. stop using Americans tax dollars against us, it is traitorous!

They increase the consumption of US which is good to US economy. If F1 students have long time to live in US, their parents and friends are more likely to come to US for traveling. They hope to ask F1 students to buy good in US as gifts. This reform will not only create consumption of the F1 student himself, but also the whole family behind the F1 students.\n\nThirdly, it is good for F1 students.\nWith a longer OPT time, they are more likely to be employed and more time to strength their work experience.

I oppose it and urge you to reconsider and abandon it.\nTwo shocking facts about the OPT program are that OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is most often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    \tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    \tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes\nUnder the OPT program.

I know people who made massive student loans. And their plan is to repay the loan in two or three years by earning the money in dollars. If the OPT stem extension was vacated their situation would be miserable. They are smart enough to get a job in their home countries if they are sent back. But repaying the loan amount would take decades. In future, this would discourage many smart students to pursue higher education in USA. This can affect US universities economically and gradually decrease the diversity of US universities.\n\nI don't see a point in vacating OPT extension, if it was to provide more opportunities to US citizens: \n\n1. The Big companies that have branches across world: They hire based on a person's talent and skills regardless of citizenship and immigration status. If they have a foreign student on 12-month OPT, rather than losing the resource due to immigration issue, the company would offer an opportunity for the same candidate offshore. This will not necessarily create new opportunities with in USA. Instead it will create a brain-drain (Skilled students will be sent away). \n\n2. Companies that are growing and don't have branches across the world: They do hire foreign students, considering the probability of getting a H1 they hire foreign students in a small percentage to avoid sudden loss of large number of employees.\n\n3. There are many small companies and start-ups that do not hire foreign students to avoid extra work. During my job search, I came across many such companies. I always wanted to work for a start-up, it disappointed me that many companies did not consider me due to my immigration status. \n\nSo I would say, US citizens have more opportunities and have higher probability of getting a job than an immigrant. Even if both graduated from same school with same degree and are equally smart. OPT or OPT extension does not ruin the employment opportunities for the citizens of United States.

I think it was written reasonably with the various stakeholders in mind.\n\nI was glad to see a provision for employer training and mentoring programs (section V.D) , although that may turn into a barrier for graduates working with small employers who view this as a staffing burden.  Nonetheless, such a provision should enhance the overall work experience of our graduates.\n\nI believe 24 months of STEM extension employment would be an improvement to the educational experience for students (section III.B).  Students can acquire substantial work experience over 36 months (total including the initial period of OPT) assuming there's little unemployment.\n\nI was also relieved to see that students would report changes in name, address, and employer info. (name and address) directly to DHS (III.B).  It's very difficult to get graduates to keep in touch with us after graduation since we don't have much of a carrot to dangle.  The longer they are out (post-college), the more difficult this becomes.  This proposed requirement makes worlds of sense!\n\nAs for students submitting an evaluation of his or her STEM OPT every six months to their DSO (V.D.), I am not sure that all DSO's are qualified to assess if graduates are truly meeting their goals.  I sometimes have just a basic understanding of what students are doing likely because both of my degrees are in the social sciences.  I don't believe such a designation is appropriate for many administrative employees of colleges and universities.  I also know that students will not consistently meet this requirement.  It's been burdensome to comply with the validation reporting requirements since students often don't stay in touch with us, regardless of requirements.  I'd urge DHS to please reconsider this provision.\n\nFinally, I wholeheartedly support a second period of STEM OPT being available to students who obtain a second qualifying STEM degree (V.B).  I also think it's very wise to allow students to work in the field of a previously earned qualifying degree, providing that the degree is from an accredited institution and the work would be directly related to that STEM major (V.F).  I appreciate the flexibility this provision demonstrates.  Both provisions acknowledge our need to remain competitive in this global education market as well as the gaps in the US labor market.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nSincerely,\nJacqueline Haring, PDSO\nFranklin & Marshall College\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1339","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jacqueline Haring"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stem opt of 24 months is better than for 17 months opt","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1355","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rishabh Jain, NYU"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am in a support for the new proposal of increasing F1 OPT STEM Extension.

I am currently on the OPT STEM Extension which was vacated recently effective 02/12/2016. Our first attempt to obtain an H-1B visa in 2015 was unsuccessful due to the limited availability via lottery. Without the availability of a STEM extension, I will need to leave the United States immediately post 02/12/2016 and take my specialized knowledge to another country. \n \nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the following reasons.\n1.\tThe STEM extension period will provide me valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates can not only gain real-world knowledge in the chosen industry but will also be a great opportunity to practice the knowledge gained during the course of the Ph.D research funded by federal grants. \n2.\tThe additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network not just within the country but also internationally which will benefit the scientific output in the U.S. \n3.\tThese benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies and educational institutions to remain competitive globally.   \n4.\tIn the absence of such a program, STEM students with advanced degrees will be forced to leave the country if their H-1B visa application is not successful and will take their specialized knowledge to competing countries with more inviting immigration rules which will be a huge loss to the U.S. economy. \n5.     STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n6.\tExpanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in many industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for young children who are the future of the U.S. \n \nIn addition to supporting the other proposed changes, here are some suggestions for your perusal. \n1.\tThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months if not more \n A 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning to make it meaningful. Students with specialized knowledge like mine should be granted up to 36 months of practical training which will enable them to work on more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n \n2.\tOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension in case of a vacatur. The following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT\n(i)\tAny student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. \n(ii)\tAny application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. \n(iii)\tA student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the grace period.\n  \nConclusion\nThe STEM OPT Extension proposal has many advantages which will help fuel the U.S. economy and raise the bar for science & technology globally. The arguments that native-born workers are affected due to this program is untrue since workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs especially in specialized fields like mine. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and opportunities for native-born workers which will positively impact the economy. \n \nAdvanced degree graduates that are employed in the STEM fields contribute to the most dramatic gains. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months if not more, is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students through federal grants. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nSB","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2984","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Shilpa B."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nI find it appalling that any elected official would have a passing thought based on this concept.

International students have been a very important group of American education system as they are contributing diversity, academic achievemnt to the country from technology development perspective, and since the number of international students is huge, the economic growth of the country also benefit from their huge amount of consumptions.\n\nSecond, the technology development would benefit from having more skilled, educated technicians. Let's take Silicon Valley, CA as an example: about 36% of the employees working for the technology companies are foreign born and the majority of the 36% employees are international students who are working on their OPT. Imagine that if the OPT extension rule was revoked, these international employees would be forced back home and that would bring a great loss for the companies. Many of the important ongoing projects could even be forced to stop forever. And that would definitely bring a negative impact on the technology and economic development for California and even the country (think about how important the Silicon Valley is in terms of technology and economic growth).\n\nThird, some people may hold the opinion that STEM graduates could work on the one-year OPT after graduation. But the fact is new hires will need at least 6 to 8-month training before they could get to know the work process of the company and make contributions. If they will have to leave right after they are ready to work more efficiently and effectively, companies would not even hire them at the beginning. The 24-month extension would definitely solve this problem, and it provides an excellent opportunity for both the employees to get more familar with the work and the employer to know more about the employee, it gives the employers more time to evauate the employee in order to make decisions on whether sponsoring the employee or not. Thus, this action will largely decrease the risk for both sides of employment.\n\nLast, becuase of the cap of the H1-B work visa, there are thousands of thousands of newly hired international employees competing for the limited positions (that's why it is called a lottery). Under this circumstances, strange phenomenons are appearing like companies specilizing in helping their employees particiting in this lottery even the employees are currently not in U.S.. And all these, as I think, are becuase the authorized work period after graduation was too short, if the OPT were extended, then DHS, USCIS, job market as a whole would have much less pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, extending the OPT would benefit all that were involved in this issue (the country and its economic and techology development, immigration department, job markets, students theirselves, etc.).

I don't understand how they can compete with you, If you really want fair competition in US, remove the restriction of field of education and then just look at the competition posed.\n\nThe truth is F-1 students want to get educated in US universities, gain practical training, earn money $$ to repay loans and go back to the home country. Just imagine if STEM OPT is vacated, I can assure current students will be effected but mainly the US economy will take a hit. How you ask: Every year more than 60000 students take ETS offered GRE/TOEFL to get admission and statistics show the highest takers are form India or China which will go down with OPT rule vacated. Admissions will take a hit so Universities can fund themselves anymore and if you think American universities are having enough students just goto the several admission tours US universities do atleast 3 times a year in every city in India, China to get qualified students who pay FEES without any kind of aid.\nH1b fees is used for border protection and US govt budget esp USCIS benefits from every 350$ students pay for processing pre-OPT, Post-OPT, STEM-extension and pay highest tax amounts without any benefits as classified non-resident alien.\nSo the ball is in your field, choose what to do but with leaders like Modi taking steps to improve economy and living standards now if you give a reason for students to go back and not choose to get fancy degrees from US, thats your loss.\nThis is a good initiative to retain talent in US so please approve this rule and increase f1-to H1 conversion- we want to be legal immigrants.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1365","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Dinesh ."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To extend the period to another 24 months is very beneficial for both company and employee.

Also they are eager to work and contribute their effort to the US's economy. I think if they can extend their work period after graduation, it will be a good thing for both themselves and the whole US economy. It can be reflected in the following aspects:\n\n1. STEM students who can work in the US definitely generate a large amount of tax revenue for the US government. These tax can be very beneficial for both the US citizens and the country. It helped US to maintain the economical advantage in the world.\n\n2. A lot of STEM students are working in many fields of research including natural science and technology. There is no need to mention how important advanced technology can be to US. With the effort of those F-1 students, US has maintained its leading position in terms of science and technology. Therefore, if those F-1 students can work longer, they will contribute more to the US's science and technology. \n\n3. In industry, there is a large amount of demand for highly educated employees like engineers and technical people every year. STEM students just can fill this gap and contribute their effort to the whole industry. Also, those STEM students are all coming from good universities and excel in many aspects. With those students, American industry can long maintain its innovation and creativity, thus can be always in the leading position in the world.\n\nThere are many other good sides for extending the training opportunities for those F-1 students, such as enhancing communication between American people and people from other countries, improving the ethnics diversity in US and also bringing creative thoughts in many aspect of the society.\n\nOverall, I believe that if we could improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 students, the US economy should become much stronger.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1535","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Shun Mao"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly oppose the extension of this program.

My friend had to train his replacement at CISCO before he was fired.   He has been unemployed or under-employed now for several years.\n\nOur son studied computers and IT in high school.   He was planning to continue his IT studies in college or technical school, but we successfully talked him out of it!   Why?  Because there is no future for American Citizens in this field.  It would be a dead end.  He could make a similar amount of money as a manager at a fast food restaurant, and not have to pay for additional schooling.   If he studied IT in college, he would have to compete with third world workers who are thrilled to come to the U.S. and make $35,000, because of the other benefits of living here, and because of chain migration policies, they can bring their entire extended family.\n\nThis program is just a government subsidy for Big Businesses who want to import cheap labor, so they don't have to pay American Citizens a living wage.\n\nThis program should be ended.

The OPT and OPT extension policy provides a good way for U.S. to retain those skillful and precious talents in US, contributing to keep U.S. competitive and powerful. In addition, for the most fields the STEM students work on, there are insufficient local talent supply from US citizens.\nOn the other hand, if this rule cannot be approved in time, lots of highly skillful and educated talents will be forced to leave US, which will definitely cause unacceptable loss to many high-tech companies and research organizations. By the way, these lost talents might in turn strengthen U.S.' competitor countries.\nIn addition, lots of the OPT holders are with master/PhD degrees, who achieved their research degrees through the sponsoring from scholarship and research/teaching assistant-ship, which source from the US tax-payers. Their leaving from US also causes a waste of tax investment.\nIn a word, it is imperative for the government to approve it in time, which can win support from the majority of U.S. industries, academia and common citizens.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3154","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Joe Liu, Yahoo!"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think this is a great step forward.

To keep American tech companies competitive, continuous leverage of technologies is a must. The good news is that with the solid finance foundation of large cooperation and the abundant angel investor opportunities, US companies, big or small, are much easier to gain access to the best technologies available than the rest of the world. However, to fully take the advantage of these technologies we also need to have the talents who know how to work with these technologies. Hiring experts and experienced workers is always the best choice to maximize the return on these technologies, but the tech companies requires an unprecedented growth rate in order to stay competitive in the global market, and these companies need to acquire talents through all means to keep this growth rate.  STEM students, who have specialized in science and technology in colleges or even graduate schools, are ideal to aid this course. Google, Facebook and Salesforce are just a few examples of how fast tech companies expand today, and these companies would not achieve their speed of expansion if STEM students are not able to make their contribution.

The additional clauses to provide protection to US workers against displacement, ensuring adequate compensation for those on OPT and limiting the program to accredited schools also serve to preserve the intent of the OPT extension program.\nThe only debatable clause in the proposed rule is the 'Training and Mentoring Plan'. While it does not ensure that it will restrict OPT program abuse, it will definitely make genuine employers think twice before hiring students on OPT. The proposed rule requires the employer to prepare a 'training plan' when the student is about to potentially begin his 2nd year of employment. Most training usually occurs in the first year on the job and the 2nd/3rd years are usually spent on 'learning by doing'. Advanced degree/Doctorate degree holders are usually the most qualified personnel in a company and those on F-1 visas use the OPT program to obtain 'practical experience' by applying their skills and knowledge in the 'real world'. They may also have junior employees reporting to them. To expect both the employers and employees to be held against a 'training plan' for 3 years of employment for highly skilled personnel does not make business sense for either party. Business plans are confidential in nature and employers may not be comfortable in releasing detailed information to external sources and the training plan documents will end up being generic documents limited to high level job descriptions. University DSOs may not also be familiar with technical job activity descriptions and may not be in a position to review and approve these documents.\n\nThe STEM OPT program was conceived to allow students multiple attempts at the H1-B visa while gaining experience. Students who apply for the STEM extn are mostly those who were petitioned for by an employer but not selected in the H1-B lottery. If the employer has already considered them for an H1-B, it means that they have been considered suitable for regular employment. To put such employees back on 'training' mode does not make sense for the employer. \n\nWhat can be done in lieu of the 'Training/Mentoring plan' is to provide USCIS with a job profile document detailing employee roles and responsibilities and an organization structure chart. The job profile provided during recruiting or advertising for the job can also be included. If there are any significant changes in job profile or positions during the course of OPT, the same can be intimated to the DSO. I believe this approach will ease the burden on all parties involved - the employer, employee and university DSO.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1911","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ritesh Gupta"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"hi , \n\n   Do increase the span of the opt , and it will be helpful to the students.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0537","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Karunakar Thippireddy"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is important for international students and employers.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department says \"there is no training in this program.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n- \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter.

How about making similar rules that employers must first try to hire/train US Citizens and show that they have tried before allowing foreign students to be hired or trained? Make the employers show cause why no US Citizen is qualified or can be trained to perform similar functions as the foreign student/employee. We have a responsibility to grow our own STEM capabilities before we encourage foreign employment in the United States. We do have adequate university and college programs, because the foreign students flock to the United States to get a superior education over what is available in their own countries. Set up programs to encourage corporations to educate our own citizens.\nI was educated under Degree Completion program in the US Army, then went on to be employed in STEM position with Caltech/JPL for 20 years where Caltech paid for additional graduate degree programs.

What this means for citizen students is that they can look forward to low paying jobs if they do the exceptionally hard work of getting a technical degree. OPT removes the technical incentive and the ability for American students to pay back their loans. \n\nTAXPAYER MONEY IS BEING USED TO CREATE JOB LOSS AND WAGE DEPRESSION FOR CITIZENS:\nWho benefits from OPT? Taxpayers will pay billions of dollars (see above) so that their children can be unemployed or payed low wages if they go into STEM. Meanwhile those billions of dollars of taxpayer money allow American businesses to get wildly cheap labor. Shouldn't business shoulder the cost of importing and training labor for them to use? Why should taxpayers shoulder that burden for businesses who have no loyalty to American citizens?\n\nDESPITE SELF-SERVING CLAIMS OF LOW LEVELS OF TECH WORKERS, IN REALITY THE UNEMPLOYMENT IN ENGINEERING IS ALREADY HIGH DUE TO THE MISCHIEF OF OPT.\n\nIT IS TIME TO PUT OUR AMERICAN STUDENTS AND WORKERS IN HIGH TECH FIELDS FIRST.\nIT IS NEVER APPROPRIATE FORCE TAXPAYERS TO FUND POLICIES THAT RESULT IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGE DEPRESSION TO THE BENEFIT OF COMPANIES WHO HAVE NO LOYALTY TO AMERICA OR HER CITIZENS.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3507","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Steven Kuethe"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully suport the new proposal.\nIt can increase the country economy and lot more.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2153","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Thirumala Charya Arutla"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I definitely support the proposal, which is a demonstration of the country's respect for talents and knowledge, and its respect for human beings. The proposal not only will benefit STEM students who were, are and are to come to this country to study the cutting-edge technology and knowledge, but also benefit the United States, the US companies and its people.\n\nAn international student, I'm also working with my OPT, and the work experience really helps me apply what I learned from school to work, and allow me to gain real-world experience. It is really a valuable experience. However, because I only have one-year OPT time (I'm not a STEM student), many employers who were interested in me couldn't hire me as they were afraid that they might lose me in the next year, which would a loss and inconvenience for the company. So I missed a lot of wonderful work opportunities only because of my status. Fortunately my current company was willing to give me a chance, because I have what they need that they couldn't find in other American students: I can speak fluent Mandrin Chinese and our company is setting up a joint venture in China, and needs a person who can speak both Chinese and English fluently. Due to the ever growing globalization, more and more international students will be needed in companies for their advantages in foreign languages. If they have to miss the opportunities only because of status, it would be a great loss for international students, and especially the American companies who will expand their business on a global scale.\n\nIf the STEM students are granted to work for 24 more months after their initial OPT, it will provide American companies with more talents they need. They will be able to use their talents and knowledge to develop new technologies to benefit the country and even the whole world. Also, international students who working and living in the US are a huge driving force of the country's economy, as they will also need to pay taxes, and spending money for a living in the country. A lot of international students that i know, including myself, are also volunteering for the community to help build a better life here.\n\nHowever, if deprived of the OPT extension, I'm afraid that the international students' willingness to come to the states to study will also be discouraged, because they won't be have to able adequate time to practice what they learned at school to gain experience.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll all for the 24-month OPT extension proposal for STEM international students, and look forward to seeing this wonderful proposal gets approved to benefit both the international students and the United States.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3375","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yao Dong"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I disagree with the concepts of this proposed rule.

I am writing this comment to support the decision of extending the STEM OPT period to 24 months, not only because it's in my own interest to do so, but more importantly it's also in American's interest. What makes America a great country? You might think democracy and freedom. Undeniably so. But is Europe less democratic or less free? I don't think so. IMHO, it's INNOVATION that really makes America great, and innovation is about people.\n\nYet as an international student, I've seen many smart people, truly smart people, who graduated from top universities in China and IVY leagues in the US, and wanted to start up their career here in the US, but was forced back to China due to visa limitations. It's such a pity to see them having to leave the US for visa problems, for myself personally and for the Americans, since they were such young and bright minds.\n\nOPT extension is a critical step to help more smart people from all over the world and contribute their intelligence to the US, particularly in the STEM area.

My OPT STEM extension expires in December 2015 and I was hoping this rule which extends the STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months will be implemented sooner so that I can benefit from it too by allowing me to have one more chance at H-1B (I did not get selected last year). Still, I am glad that at least others who are not so close to end of their extension period will be able to benefit from it - my husband being one of them. He completed PhD in electrical engineering from a major university and is working as senior hardware engineer in a reputed company. But his H-1B application did not get selected in the lottery last year either and we are faced with a very real situation of having to leave US and rebuild our future elsewhere. This rule would definitely help him (and thereby, us). \n\nIt would be great if the rule can be implemented in such a way that if people like me who will potentially be in the 60-day grace period after expiration of OPT status when this rule comes into effect can also apply for the remaining 7 months (24 -17) of the OPT extension. This would allow us to have one more chance of applying for H-1B. I have done masters in a microbiology-molecular biology combined program and I currently work as a scientist in a leading diagnostic company where I work on projects that make a real difference for patients and hospitals. My company values me highly for my expertise on the job and they are willing to do anything to keep me working there - but of course, there is nothing that they can do! I have more than 5 years of experience in this field (research + on the job) and yet, I am going to be out of work in December - it is very hard to come to terms with that. \n\nThis STEM extension is absolutely necessary for students graduating in these times - number for applications submitted for H-1B is at an all-time high and consequently the percentage of students who are able to get selected is getting lower every year.  I fail to understand the point of sending away highly skilled workers who were educated here and bringing in lesser skilled foreign workers every year though H-1B. Those big IT consulting companies don't care which of their thousands of applications get selected each year  - they can play with probability game to get a fixed number of workers in every year.\n\nStudents (especially those who spent more that 5 years doing PhD in US) having to go back to their home countries because of this is just not a fair system. I think that this rule should allow for two 24 month extensions to PhD students since they have completed the highest level of education in US - allowing them more chances to apply and get selected for H-1B definitely. Also, I think this rule is essentially forcing undergraduate and masters students to go back to school even if they don't want to just because they did not get selected in H-1B and have to keep status/ get more OPT extension. I might be an idealist, but higher education should be undertaken because the student is actually interested in it - not as a means for getting visa or keeping status. In implementing conditions like these, it is the 'real' students who go to 'real' universities who suffer. In fact, why not just allow two 24 month extensions for all students and allow them to use it however they want to!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0840","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Neetha Paul "},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am glad to hear this!!!\n\nBut I think the STEM extension for OPT should be increased to 36 months instead of 24 months as it will increase the likelihood of USA getting a return on its investment of training the students in the best universities in the world.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0323","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ashish Tyagi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There are certain aspects in the proposed regulation that look/feel like deterrents for the employers to employ international students. Some them are like the requirement of the mentoring and training program that require separate funding. This is feasible for large companies like Ford, GMC, etc. But it is not feasible by smaller companies which would like to employ international students. This will lead to more students converting from their current majors into IT or computer sciences and go to consultancies that work specifically to employ international students. This will further lead to IT and computer sciences jobs being taken from American students and given to others. This trickle down effect will further worsen the situation instead of fixing it.\n\nI think a simpler system which is common for American students and international students would help more students and have a positive umbrella effect.

The proposed rule gives U.S. corporations and universities the means to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination while denying American workers the same benefit of OPT.

First, the enhanced post-graduate training benefits for F1 visa holders will help American Universities to attract the needed capital and top talents from all over the world and retain their leading positions. This will benefit local/American students by providing them with a multi-cultural study environment, even better academic resources and financial aid opportunities. Second, this new rule will help STEM graduate students better focus on their jobs/functionalities in critical positions where there is a labor shortage of qualified local/American students. The reality is American companies are very unwilling (as they should be) to hire foreign students unless they absolutely have to, because of the complicated procedure and high cost. If a STEM student without a long-term stay promise (OPT is temporary) is hired for a position, it is more than likely a position where there are not many qualified American students available in that specific area.

Employers save 7.65% of worker salaries when they hire foreign students instead of American workers because they don't have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

To me, this isn't about immigration, but about securing America's status as a nation where intellectuals of the world can go to for a safe and free place to innovate and achieve what they can't in their homelands. For me, this is also a personal issue as I come from a family of immigrants and I have first hand experienced the generosity and freedom that this nation is capable of. We should be setting a model for the rest of the world on how to treat intellectuals who just want to work, not kicking them out and letting other nations benefit from their skills. I want America to be great, and to do so, we need to attract the best and the brightest from around the world. This rule change is just one step in many that I support. Recent graduates should be allowed to experience working in an American workplace where personal freedoms are respected and individual entrepreneurial-ism is encouraged, along with gaining the knowledge that they'll need for the rest of their lives. Plus, we forget that these are still, at their base, people who came from many thousands of miles away just for a chance at a better opportunity.

Americans are the smartest, brightest, fastest learning, HARDEST WORKING persons on the planet. \n\n   The STEM shortage of Americans is an ABSOLUTE LIE. Companies are simply using it as another means of getting foreign workers to work under contract and full time to replace American workers. PERIOD!!  I was an \"I.T.\" specialist supporting applications, servers, stand alone computers, Creating software from scratch, as well as supporting all of it 24/7 365 for nearly 40 years.\n\n   The company I worked for chose to bring in foreign workers to do Americans Jobs.  It is a lie that they propagate that it is a cost saving initiative. \n\n   The truth of the matter is that everyday an American loses their job, Correction, There job is Taken away from them and given  To a foreign worker.  If Americans are so lacking in our knowledge, Then answer these questions:\n\n    WHY must an American worker Train the foreign worker to do their job before the American worker is terminated?\n\n    WHY can an American worker support the job requirements that as in my case , they created themselves by systems analysis, Writing , testing, implementing the applications,\nHOWEVER,  For the foreign workers to support the same thing often requires multiple persons here in the American office, and an entire team of offshore workers?.\n\n    Why most of the time what ever the foreign worker provide to the company must it be \nCorrected or replaced by what an American worker does?\n\n    Why is the American worker put thru hell in an effort to force them to resign their position so that more control can be given to the foreign worker?\n\nFor nearly 40 years with the same company, My work was appreciated and understood as some of the best by management.  I was abused to the point I was forced to take measures to leave the company If I valued my health and my life.  It took well over a dozen asian Indians to do what I did alone.  \n\nIF you ask me, Then that makes this American at least \n12 times harder working\n12 times more intelligent\n12 time faster learning\n12 times a far better Employee\nThan any foreign worker.\n\nAmerica DOES NOT NEED Foreign Workers.

As we know US has the best colleges all over the world and that is the reason why it attracts the best students from almost all other counties coming here to build this great country. If the extension is terminated that means America will lose lots of most intelligent workers and at the same time fewer and fewer smart student will choose to come here and contribute to this country. It will damage the economy and culture diversity of US in near future. It is radiculous to think international student will take the job opportunities from Americans, because the number of jobs is not decided by population but by the economy. America can be America is just because it can allow intelligent people doing something here. So I strongly recommend to get the policy approved.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1128","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Justin Zhang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support the new proposed OPT extension rule.

With this extension, US universities and colleges would be much more likely to attract international students, each of whom would spend averagely 25000 dollars on tuition a year in US. Besides, they would also have extra spending on living, shopping, and renting. This kind of spending would stimulate the growth of US economy, not to mention that they would bring relatives to come to US to visit and shop. This adds to the revenue of US touring business and sales business. If there is no benefits like OPT, international students might tend to choose Australia, Canada, New Zealand etc which have better regulations for international students, and they would probably obtain the revenue which could have been gained by US.\n2. This extension would also benefit companies which are in need of selected IT professionals. As the IT industry grows enormously in US, almost all the companies have evolved, and need at least web support. However, the H1B capital has not increased. There exists lots of arguments on whether the number of US STEM students is more than the number of STEM jobs, and this subject, in my opinion, bears little relevance on whether OPT should be granted to foreigners since the ratio ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 in various studies.\nFirst, even the number is larger than that of job postings, it does not mean that the company needs are satisfied. In STEM field, quality is at a lot of occasions more important than quantity. That is to say, companies choose candidates based more on their qualifications, and lots of unqualified candidates is worse than a few qualified candidates. It is not to say that US STEM students are not competent, but they are not all that competent and companies do not have to bear with it.\nSecond, many STEM students ended up working outside STEM fields. After years in STEM, those students find more suitable career paths. So the number of degrees earned does not mean the actual work force.\nThird, companies which choose international students are mostly focusing on international strategies. They truly need people from different areas of the world, and they need the best, not in US, but internationally. Choosing the best people in the world would mean that they can be the best companies in the world. Otherwise, they would not necessarily be the best. Therefore, OPT extension simply provides companies more choices, and if they do wish, they can always choose citizens.\nFourth, companies have every intention to make money. Hiring foreigners means that they have to go through legal procedures, which is costly. If citizens would do the work, they have no need to hire foreigners. It also rebuts the claim that foreign workers are cheap so they are hired.\n3.This extension also bears moral and humanistic meanings. As we are all aware, the former OPT regulation is becoming obsolete in February 2016. However, lots of graduate students have already obtained permission from DHS to work longer than February 2016. If this extension does not pass, it means next February millions of students have to leave because US changes its mind. It would be actually an act of breaking promises, and would not make this country look nice. Also, lots of companies would suddenly lose employers, which can cause great loss in their benefits.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2872","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Xiaopei Zhang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We hae a shortage of jobs for US citizens, and a work force that is unemployed of over 90 million.

This should be the case in any economic climate, but it is well known that American workers today are in a vulnerable position. In the United States, the wages of tech workers have been flat for several years, and thousands of American STEM-degree holders are out of work.\n\nIt would have been proper, under the law, for this program to have been entirely vacated. In the future, judges and government officials ought to explain to the American people the basis for their authority to allow foreign students to work while holding nothing more than student visas.\n\nIn addition to the employment issues, it is notable that employers who hire foreign students under this program will avoid paying employment taxes. Frankly this exposes a cynical motivation behind the expensive lobbying effort waged by employers in support of increasing the number of OPT visas. As if the detriment to American workers were not obvious enough, they are being harmed both coming and going--suffering from their jobs being taken by foreign workers, they then can anticipate less support from a government that has, in effect, given large corporations generous tax breaks.\n\nMy wife happens to be a green card holder--she and I were careful to complete the appropriate applications and pay the required fees so that she could gain her work and residence statuses through established legal channels. It is disheartening to both of us, and, I am sure, to many similar legal immigrants, so observe the system being treated cynically, against the national interest.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment and hope that my remarks will be taken seriously.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2448","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Evan McLaren"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support this proposal of improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 Students. This is a Win-Win solution for several different related parties.\n\n\nThe US government, or we may say the country of the US, is the major one who benefits, because this policy would keep qualified talents staying in the US to contribute their skill and wisdom to help America retain its the strongest scientific and technological power in the world wild. Those people who are eligible for OPT extension are highly educated and well trained people in high tech area. The offer of job already proved the ability of these candidates. A lot of people will leave without the extension because they may not be able to get H-1B too. They will find a place in other countries to develop their career and contribute their wisdom. That means the US loses talents and other competitor gets. It may not impact the position of America immediately, but its predictable that there is negative impact to America in long term.\n\n\nAnother party which would be helped by this proposal is employers. A lot of high tech companies have very diverse employees, and a part of them are students who have master or PHD degree  in F-1 OPT status. The company usually chooses employee with its strict criteria. A typical employee process has to go through HR, financial, Hiring Team etc departments, and to through advertisement, phone screen(a lot), phone interview(a lot), then on-site interview(a few) steps. It usually takes months to settle down one position. A tons of money and effort are spent for every hiring. In addition, companies need continue spend money and effort to train new employees to let them adapt to the environment. However, the company will lose the OPT employee very soon because the employee may not have working permission. How painful it is! Yes, employers wont have this problem if they simply dont hire F-1 Nonimmigrant students. Unfortunately, because of the criteria of the job position, its not easy to find qualified candidates. This OPT extension proposal will release the pain for employers, as there is enough time to help their employees settle down and keep improving and contribute themselves.\n\n\nThe last but not the least party is individual. No matter what reason brings an international student come to the US, a common object for him/her is success. After spent tons of money($40,000 ~ $60,000 for a master, much more for PHD) for education, and suffered stressful job hunting process, eventually got a dream job, no one would like to be kicked off just because of the immigration policy. Does individual who is native get benefit from their foreign colleagues? I would say yes. My current company has such a good open culture. I have colleagues from every continents. People are smart, respectful, and working hard. I believe its a very good environment for everyone no matter where he/she is coming from. \n\n\nIn consequence, this is good for a lot of people. I definitely vote to this proposal.

A lot of places can be improved along with this proposed role and a more matured training system can be realized. U.S.'s career market is demanding STEM talents and with their work, numerous social value can be generated, which is a good thing to U.S.' economics and technology.\nFinally, these international STEM students are students who accept the highest education of U.S. and dream of contributing to the development of science and technology in the most advanced country in the world. They are becoming values that cannot be ignored, and they are worth given better opportunities.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0642","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Xue Yang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the proposed rule.

IF the point is to make/keep America great, it is imperative that citizens who embrace the American way, have paid their dues and are qualified, be the first considered and employed.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3529","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Artha Ortiz"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I agree with the new rule.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0961","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Partha Krishna Eppa"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe this proposal would benefit both native and international workers in US.

The best source of that skilled workforce is the foreign nationals educated in the US universities. \n\nThe U.S. job market is not a \"zero-sum game\" in which workers must fight each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has the most dynamic and powerful economy the world has ever known, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked shoulder to shoulder with native-born workers to build it.\n\nThe overwhelming weight of research shows that in our dynamic labor market, skilled immigrants complement their U.S.-born counterparts. Skilled immigrants' help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign workers positively impact the wages and employment opportunities of native-born workers across our economy.\n\nThe important role that skilled immigrants play in our economy extends far beyond the world of computers and high tech, and skilled immigrants are helping to reshape communities far beyond Silicon Valley. They are making enormous contributions in almost every aspect of our economy, including manufacturing, medical research, healthcare delivery, and agriculture. Their contributions have helped rebuild economies in places like Des Moines, Iowa; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nFor me, the bottom line is this:\n\nIn today's global economy, where other countries are spending billions of dollars to compete with America's ability to attract immigrants, we cannot take this issue for granted. If we continue to ignore the need for immigration reform or adopt policies that discourage skilled immigrants from helping America to innovate, lead, and create more high-paying jobs we run the enormous risk that America will be left behind, without a robust innovation and entrepreneurial sector.\n\nInnovation is the key to growing the U.S. economy and creating jobs. In turn, the key to innovation is attracting, growing, and retaining a skilled workforce. Foreign-born workers, especially STEM workers, have been and will continue to be a critical part of this equation.\n\nThe policies, similar to this proposed rule, will help us fulfill the promise of an immigration system that serves a 21st century, global economy, while protecting the rights and promoting opportunities for all workers.\n\nResearch supports the creation of a revamped and revitalized immigration system with updated visa caps and the elimination of per-country quotas; a system that retains talented individuals who were educated in the United States. We need a system that supports STEM education right here at home; a system that encourages compliance with rules and safeguards against exploitation and abuse; and that allows for more flexibility, predictability, and consistency.\n\nThe good news is that these reforms are achievable, and that lasting immigration reform is within our reach. The key to success is to not pursue these issues in isolation. Maximizing the economic contributions of skilled immigrants is important work, but it is only one component of the broad based reforms our system desperately needs. We must realize that immigrant job creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators come in all shapes and sizes. They come to our shores not only through employment-based channels but through family reunification and as refugees and asylees. They can also be found within the population of unauthorized workers.\n\nThe importance of reforming our systemall aspects of itto further our prosperity cannot be overstated. We owe it to ourselves and our future to once again support and pass bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that is good for business, good for workers, and good for families.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2285","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Harris Reynolds"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to know why you want to hire foreign workers over American workers?

I hope some of those bureaucratic rules will be eased when the rule goes through the review process. \n\nThank you,\nEngineering Leader, \nSilicon Valley, CA, USA.\nOctober 23rd 2015.  \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2082","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Larry S."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With the condition of our economy the way it has been in our country for the past seven years, WHY, WHY, WHY are we not offering special training to OUR CITIZENS first and foremost?\n\nWe have allowed too many foreigners into our country and it has put our economy in the toilet, and will continue to do so until we focus on helping our own citizens get employment first.  Immigration limits, decided decades ago, were designed to allow for assimilation into our country so that the economy would not be overtaxed and would continue to flourish.  With 13 - 20 million illegals in our country, clearly we are in this horrible economic condition because we have lost control.

The idea of Optional Practical Training is to provide an opportunity to the students from various countries, who come to U.S. for education, to have practical experience in the United States before they go back to serve their home counties. The period of 1 year seems to be appropriate for \"practical training\" in any field. \n\nI have never been a fan of STEM extensions. The fact that DHS distinguishes between the STEM and non-STEM students in fixing the allowed duration for OPT may be due to one of the following two reasons:\n\n1. Either the DHS, at an institutional level, believes that STEM fields are so superior and highly specialized than other fields like law, humanities, journalism etc, that they require up to 3 year just to provide training for the work; or\n\n2. DHS is using STEM OPT just as a disguise to provide work authorization to the \"TECHIES\" from countries like India and China. It is also to give them more chances to try their luck in H-1B lotteries.\n\nIf you try and contact the largest companies in the STEM field, none of them will have such enormous and extravagant training programs which last for three long years. Most training programs last for a maximum of 6 months. Given the facts that the students are from an alien country, even 1 year seems to be apt. \n\nTherefore, I can't seem to understand the need for STEM extension either for 17 or 24 months. I would strongly recommend giving same treatment to all the students and making the OPT 3 years for all or for none. \n\nThe court questioned the legality of the procedure followed to initiate STEM extension for 17 months. The DHS, in an endeavor to overcome that, has come up with this proposal.\n \n ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1975","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Abhinav Tripathi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"it is very useful if its processed.it will very helpfull to students like me to get more knowledge in the subject.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2005","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jayaprasad Guntumadugu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The short period of 12 months for OPT is simply not enough for fogien talents to find jobs, who will, when given opportunities, prove to make great contributions to the development of this great country, who has been calling for talents all over the world for the past two centuries, which makes the United States best country in the world.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1863","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jiaming Chen, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Nowadays, IT corporations is developing fast and IT enterprise is the economic growth point of the United States.

We can easily imagine using statistics to improve health care services, or using computer technology to facilitate children's academic achievement. To accomplish such goals, we need experts who have knowledge not only in statistics or programming, but also in non-STEM areas like health care or education. However, under the previous OPT extension policy, international students who have already obtained STEM degrees would only have a very limited period of OPT if they want to pursue a second degree in non-STEM areas and work in such STEM-related but interdisciplinary fields. If they are allowed to use the previously obtained STEM degree for their OPT extension, it would be great support to their career development. \n\n\nIn addition, such a new policy would encourage international STEM students to apply their STEM knowledge to various fields in our life, rather than to stick with the very traditional STEM fields. Therefore, the traditional STEM fields will not be overcrowded with foreigners, and the interdisciplinary fields can advance with more STEM experts. Since the new policy requires the job to be related with the previously obtained STEM degree, these students will not take up employment opportunity of US-citizens in STEM-unrelated areas. The policy will be beneficial to the international students, the US economy, and the life quality/employment opportunity of the US-citizens.\n\n\n2) Deciding whether a student really majors in STEM is sometimes more difficult and complex than just looking at their I-20. The same type of program may be assigned with different CIP codes in different schools, sometimes STEM and sometimes non-STEM. For example, in developmental psychology programs (which is a STEM area), students in some schools are listed on their I-20 as majoring in STEM fields of \"child/developmental psychology\" or \"experimental psychology\", and thus considered as STEM students; however, students in other schools may have \"general psychology\", \"education\", or \"human development\" on their I-20, therefore unable to apply for the OPT extension. But in reality, these developmental psychology programs coded as non-STEM do not differ at all from those coded as STEM-related in their coursework and research. The difference in the codes is not due to the nature of the program, but a result of school bureaucracy. Therefore, dividing developmental psychology students into STEM and non-STEM and deciding their eligibility for OPT extension simply based on their most recent degree would be unfair and ignorant of the complexity in reality. Such problems do not only occur in psychology, but also in other disciplines. While it is difficult to change the STEM major categories, with the new policy, students who continuously obtained two or more degrees in the same discipline will be considered as STEM students if one of the programs are coded as STEM. This new policy will improve employment equality of students within the same discipline. \n\n\nAlternatively, to ensure employment equality, DHS should allow students who are categorized as non-STEM majors to apply for the STEM OPT extension if the students can prove that their coursework and thesis/dissertation topic can fulfill the requirements of another program that is coded as STEM.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2637","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Danming An"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support this rule.

They are paid wages lower than US folks - and the reason is \"we're restricted to what we can pay you by the regulations of your visa...\" - it's ridiculous. I have a co-worker who was offered a job (she's from a foreign country) - when she got here the terms of things changed because they had to bring her in on a different kind of visa - she's making 1/3 of what she should be making as well as not getting any benefits whatsoever. 1/3!  In Silicon Valley you can't survive on that but what can she do, she moved thousands of miles and then the company changed the rules on her. Her only choice is to stay and put up with it, or go back home. \n\nCompanies already skirt the law - they'll post a position knowing full well they already have a candidate sitting in a foreign company they're going to hire. They will do a few phone screens, maybe an in person interview or two, but with no intention of hiring anyone but that person they've already identified in that foreign country.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n\nThe message from this Regulation is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3630","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Joel Jamison"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a good step in attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals for the benefit of USA.

If a person received their STEM degree 10 years ago and have focused on another field they are not as focused or \"refreshed\" in the current research methods and topics when working with their employer.

It helps lot of Indian INC companies i.e. companies with CEO'S mainly Indians to find an illegal way to cheat the system and i would like to tell you how and what is happening currently with lot of OPT students at least to 60% of students that are being currently recruited and placed. Please read it and understand the cheating that's happening right now: 1. The consultancy recruits OPT students by a simple process without an interview either by cold calling or by referrals and almost every company has a guest house where students are being accommodated providing food and shelter for a short period of time until they gets placed(yes i am referring to placed because even though you are recruited by the company you will be never paid until you get a contract job with client - as OPT have a rule that they can be given unpaid training every consultancy says that it is legal);. Upto this there is no big fraud or cheating that happening with the system from next step everything is illegal, unethical and unlawful.2. In the meanwhile he will be asked what kind of technology he is interested in and the consultancy will give guidance as in which technology has good job market billing rate and how he can easily get a job, will the job be easy or hard with fake experience etc. so then according to the nature the consultant/student selects the technology and consultancy will give training to consultant form then. Note: Please understand that the term training that i referred is not exact training way they will give to consultants/students. The trainer teaches basic concepts in technology and will mainly train he/she to how to survive in the job with 8-10 years of fake experience and will assure consultants that he will be taking the phone interview call for the consultant/student and will also makes a deal that he will be providing job support during consultant job which is unethical i.e. student after his office or during his office will either screen share or will be communicating his office work with trainer there by breaking the office confidentiality code. Trainer does the work for him according to consultant inputs for initial days until the consultant learns his work in his office. For this the trainer or the job backup will be paid hourly or monthly by the consultant. 2. Every consultant who have been hired in OPT will be given a sample fake resume after his training which has atleast 8-10 YEARS of experience to give him an idea how an experienced resume looks like and will be advised to make a resume that shall look like a sample fake resume that has been given to consultant. 3. The consultant/student in OPT agrees to it and then prepares a resume with fake resume which includes client names and company names, years that he has worked which in reality he has never worked on. Then the client names the he puts on the resume is carefully reviewed by consultancy and consultancy will make sure that at least first 2 clients that they put have some body in the client's location either full time or contractor that consultancy knows. The reason for that is to provide job reference when client recruiter asks about reference from his previous jobs  4. Then after the resume is prepared with fake years of experience with fake clients they which here the consultancy markets the resume with their marketing team with fake resumes. Thus the fake resume goes into markets with the consultant details and google voice number almost all the consultants will be advised to have a google voice number in their resume instead of personal numbers which is left to you to decide for what they are doing like that 5.So then the fake resume goes to a prime vendor where the vendor calls the consultant  to verify his job responsibilities, so now the consultant will be well prepared with his fake resume as in how to speak when a vendor calls, so when the vendor calls the consultant the consultant will keep his fake resume in front and talks to him in that fake resume way. Then if the vendor feels good in the phone then he will forward that to main client recruiter/manager. 6. So this is the main step, so when consultant gets the interview confirmation with client manager he then calls his back up or calls his consultancy to arrange a backup. So if it is a phone interview then the consultant will put a call forwarding to the backup resource who will be taking the call for the consultancy thus inviting unethical activity. SO the consultant will forward his fake resume and details to back up so that back up will speak to client manager accordingly and thus gets paid if the consultant gets a job after the interview call as he helped consultant which will be paid by consultancy. Then the consultant if selected will be sent to that client\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2869","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Suresh Naresh"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you so much for reading.

I think this is the regulation will increase the comprehensive national strength of US and benefit general people who lives in this country. \n\nFirst of all, it will enhance US comprehensive national strength. As we all know, the composition of international students are young, knowledgeable, and full of creativity from all over the world. If we give them 24 month opt, they will have more chances to apply for H1B VISA and stay in US and working for this county. These students are very intelligent young people from all over the worlds. In school, they study dedicatedly and often times outperform domestic students. With them working at companies in our county, it will certainly increase the competitiveness of US companies in international market. Most of the stem majors are practical, we need those talented young people to work for our company. For example, the total revenue of Google is 66 billion in 2014. For employees in Google 83 percent of them are international workers, and most of them can work here because they have the opt extension and thus can apply for H1B Visa. Without this extension, I can see a great high tech company like Google goes its way down because lack of talents. It is not only a money problems. we know the IT is the representative of technology. It plays a incredible role in national defense and security. I can foresee the tragedies like 911, Snowden and political eavesdrop happens again at the time US lost its advantages in technology. Last year, US economy increased 2.4, most of the drive is from IT. I would say, without this opt extension, US will be in a huge trouble.\n\n2. Benefit American people\nThe average salary from H1B last year is about 100,000 each year. They pay average about 15 percent of their income to US as tax. We all know US is in big amount of debt for this social welfare which gives its economy a trouble. If we keep those young people in our country and let them keep paying taxes. It will release the financial burden of US significantly. With the taxes paid by opt users, we can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research.\n\n3.Other suggestions\nActually, the opt and H1b system is not flexible enough. There are too many uncertainties caused by the identity issue. This will reduce the attractiveness of staying in US. I suggest issue all international student who graduated from a US accredited university green cards. Also, those students who are not majored in stem are also very intelligent and worth to keep, we should give them the extension.

I received by doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering from Washington State University. Since graduation I have been part of the development team in a software company that services the energy sectors in not only the USA, but in Canada, south-east Asia, EU and Middle East.\n\nOne criticism that is always levels against international student is that they/we are stealing American jobs. I completely disagree with that. In almost all graduate schools in engineering, as has been pointed in the text of the proposed rule, an overwhelming number of doctoral students are international. Hiring an international student is costly for a professor as it limits the type of funding they are pursue for the student. Given the chance professors would prefer hiring US nationals. But despite this advantage, an overwhelming majority of the STEM PhD are international, which points to the fact that there aren't a whole lot of US Nationals to fill the positions in STEM graduate. A consequent effects of this is that some of the most skilled workers, workers who understand the new frontiers of technology and can give American businesses the competitive advantage, are the international students from such STEM programs.\n\n\nWhile it may be true that American workers are facing tough challenges from foreign workers, I think the WashTech lawsuit was direct to the wrong visa program. Students that benefit from the America's education system should be given every chance to contribute to America. This is definitely how other developed nations treat their international students.\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0075","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rahul Dhal, EPIS Inc."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I resent use of taxpayer funds to educate non-citizens.

Anybody with any kind of intelligence would not be being that this is a self destructing piece of legislation to any and all Legal American Citizen  The leaders and all their respective departments that run this country have gotten so far out of touch with reality that they should all resign or be impeached. They need to start looking at big picture and the real problems that face the Legal American people and taxpayers of this country instead of immigrants. To pass regulations or laws such as the current one proposed is totally asinine and irresponsible to say the least. I am tired of writing and re-writing letters to Senators,Congressmen,the President,Homeland Security, Immigration and amnesty groups and every other group out there only to have these letters fall on deaf ears. When one group gets defeated another one is right there picking up where the prior group left off. How do you expect our elected officials to tend to new business and much more important isuues facing our country when they have to continously go back to old business that should have been finalized. No, instead they get into a catch-22 situation and nothing new gets accomplished. I am enclosing parts of other letters I have written previously because these \"groups\" are wearing me down and tiring me out, please read on. \n        I ask that you please do anything and everything you can in order to prevent any new immigration reform bill from becoming law. Please read the following email Ive sent to many pro-immigration advocates and US Representatives, thank you:\n       What's wrong with the word illegal and what don't you understand about it. Look it up in the dictionary obviously you don't understand the meaning so I'll spell it out for you. It's spelled, I-L-L-E-G-A-L and it's exactly what these people are, so quit sugar coating it calling them Undocumented Immigrants. They are illegal and have no rights, privileges or protections under the Constitution of the United States and are not legal citizens. Start enforcing the laws that already exist. Deport them and if they want to re-apply for legal citizenship, let them do it legally. If the laws that are currently on the books had been enforced we wouldnt be in the predicament we are currently in. We dont need 11 million illegal immigrants in this country when unemployment is remains so high. This is also going to add to the healthcare dilemma as well as Social Security, Medicare, etc.. Before any new immigration laws are passed that will create an influx of illiterate immigrants a law has to be passed making English the official language of the United States. All of our ancestors came here and kept their customs and identities but they all learned English. They knew that in order to get ahead and be able to communicate with each other this was a necessity. The illegals that have recently come to this country dont appear to be as willing and this has created a major problem with education. Public education is guaranteed but the cost of interpreters needed to translate English into the immigrants native language isnt cost effective and causes a tremendous and unfair burden on current legal citizens and taxpayers. This is wrong and totally unacceptable. You have to look at the big picture and see what other problems this is going to create before you pass a bill thats only going to make matters worse than they are and cost the American taxpayers more of their hard earned money. Go to another country and see how far you get if you don't learn their language. Like Earl Pitts says, \"Wake up America\" before it's to late.\n     Furthermore, how ironic and despicable it is that you want to give Illegal Citizens rights they haven't earned and don't deserve while at the same time you want to take legal US citizens 2nd Amendment rights away. This also is not fair to former immigrants who came here and went through the legal process to become legal citizens. That is a big slap in the face and very unfair to them. Wake up, smell the roses and get your priorities straight.\n     First of all,greedy legal American citizens and corporations need to stop luring and exploiting illegal immigration by creating jobs, hiring and providing shelter and food. We also need an e-verify system to enforce this.    \n     Make it a Class A felony with mandatory minimum 10 years imprisonment to hire, rent, feed or offer shelter to illegal aliens that would rapidly help resolve the problem. This would also stop the exploitation of illegals by US citizens and remove the temptation for illegals to come here in the first place.\n\n          ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3751","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Bob Prosser"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For my understand, this is a good policy for all F-1 students who really want to work hard and get more experience. I saw many talented F-1 engineers gave up everything here and back to their own countries due to H1B issue. For me, I am also in F-1 OPT extension. I like work with my teams here in Indianapolis, IN. We have a big project here with other company, my OPT will be end at Dec.2016, so currently they do not assign long-term tasks on engineers like me in case we have to leave next year. \nExtra 7 month is always good for work experience and our projects. Thus in the future for other international students, they will be able to move around different companies to obtain more knowledge. Some company does not want to provide training for students with short OPT.\nAlso, it will be slightly better for us F-1 students to obtain H1B VISA since we could have 3 chances in H1B lottery. Many people from a country fill 5-10 H1B applications and get all H1Bs. Whereas good, hard working and creative students cannot get H1B and have to give up everything we build in the past few years. See Redbus2us... many of those people are low skill but get H1B.\nIn addition, this policy can help improving American economy. For example, dealer refused to lease car to me since my OPT has 17 months left. If I can have 24 months OPT to show to dealers, they will be glad to let me sign the lease. It helped industry growth, local business, and keep money in America. Win-Win. \n\nThus I have to say this is a good policy, thank you USCIS! And please make more policy to prevent people filling multiple H1B by those fake consulting companies like these:\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/archive/archive-news/11-arrested-indicted-multi-state-operation-targeting-visa-and-mail-fraud\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0813","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jack Z."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"extended OPT will give fresh graduates more time to experience American culture, more chance to go international, I definitely agree to extend OPT to 36 months total","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1470","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by yimei wen"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The United States is becoming less attractive to foreigners especially for those STEM workers and students.

OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3384","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Doug Anders"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First of all I would say that it is an execellent proposal for international students.

The STEM OPT program allows my company and other companies working in the high-tech sector to employ, train and retain outstanding STEM graduates of US Universities many of whom are foreign born.

I believe this act is good for everyone.\n\nLonger extension creates larger value for the society. America is built by elites from different races and culture. The STEM International students are those elites who are able to create values for the U.S. Longer time enables them a comparatively stable working condition, which guarantees their working quality. With such quality, the society would prosper in every aspect, technology, science, economy, etc. Besides, longer working time outputs steady and continuous contribution to America people. Scientific study, for example, if cut off within a short period of time, will not be picked up. Thus, what the government has devoted before all goes to waste. So a shorter time of opt extension, to some extent, equals to zero. In order to maximizing the benefits of STEM graduates, a longer extension will harvest.\n\nAs for students, we need a longer extension before we find a job back in our countries. First, raised in different cultures, we are more used to our native environment than American. So that wish encourages us to build our life back in home town. I have a lot of mideast friends. They all dream of going back and putting what they have learnt into their working areas. However, before serving our own societies, we need a good resume. That why we want a longer extension. In many countries, people are hired with good salaries because of their American education background, American working experiences, and International networking. It's especially obvious in my country. No one wants to start with a low paying in their homeland. That is why we eagerly want more time practice in the U.S.\n\nIn general, a 24-month-extension benefits both sides. Students will have a better career plan after practicing in America. That encourages them to work hard, and thus, hardworking creates value for the America society.\n\nThank you for your time!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1989","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Charles Jiao"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"New OPT extension rule is important for both international STEM students and US STEM related industries.\n1.

STEM OPT is only a small part of foreign working permits. H1B, of course, is the largest visa for international workers. However, it has been abused by many outsourcing companies. They support foreign workers to apply multiple H1B at once. These make large number of foreign workers enter US job market and unfair to people who studied, working and living in US.

The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned, but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nEmployers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign OPT students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. What employer wouldn't want that deal?!\n\nMass illegal immigration and legal immigration are already flooding the employment market with workers willing to work for less and expect fewer benefits, making it harder and harder for Americans to work and support their families.\n\nThis DHS-proposed OPT rule is yet another way to provide employers with cheap labor and place the societal costs of that cheap labor on the backs of the American taxpayer. America workers pay the taxes that support our government. For that, we have every right to expect to come first in consideration of our interests.\n\nHere are a couple of telling statistics about how the OPT program has affected American workers in the last several years.\n\n OPT enabled OPT program applicants to occupy 430,000 jobs (in place of American workers) during the years 2009-2013.\n\n OPT \"removed\" $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that would have been paid in by American workers.\n\nThis at a time when our economy was already \"labor heavy\" and \"job light\".\n\nThis government is supposed to work for the American people; all of the people, not just for industry special interest groups, and certainly not for citizens of other countries.\n\nIt has become clear to me that it is past time to put campaign finance reform first on our national political priorities, as this proposed rule is clearly being spearheaded by a group of elected officials whose campaigns were paid for by special interest group money, both in technology and higher education. There is no value in this proposed rule for the general American citizen and it is most certainly a detrimental proposal to those American tech workers hoping for gainful employment.\n\nAs a professional web site designer, I have watched my income stagnate and then drop over the last 10 years. I work much harder for much less than I did in past years. Meanwhile, I am putting 2 daughters through college who will enter the American workforce and be looking for gainful employment.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nPurpose of the Regulatory Action\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is nobody's definition of temporary. As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students.\n{NOTE: U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.}\nWHY IN THE H ARE  U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVIEGED PROGRAM, BECAUSE OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATES WANT TO DESTROY THIS NATION.

For example, footnote (24) refers to \"Foreign STEM Workers and Native Wages and Employment in U.S. Cities\" by Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, Chad Sparber.  An updated version of this paper was released on July 1st and an analysis of it at http://econdataus.com/jole_pss.htm shows some serious problems.\n\nIn addition, a search of the comments for the number 2.62 or 262 show at least six references to another flawed study that is often quoted by proponents of OPT expansion.  One of them is labeled \"Mass Mail Campaign 22\" and contains the following statement:\n\n\"A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development.\"\n\nGoogling this sentence shows that it's source appears to be a sample letter posted by an immigration lawyer at http://immigrationgirl.com/f-1-students-tell-dhs-to-fix-the-2008-opt-stem-extension-rule-sample-email-here/ .  Interestingly, it appears that this sentence was taken verbatim from a 2013 article at http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/articles/26825/raising-cap-need-increased-numbers-h-1b-visas-skilled-workers .  In any case, an analysis at http://econdataus.com/amerjobs.htm shows that the 2.62 number is deeply flawed. It is the result of a study of the years 2000-2007.  If you use the exact same formulas but move the time span forward two years, to 2002 to 2009, the association becomes a LOSS of 1.21 jobs.  This strongly suggests that the positive association is caused by the inclusion of the tech crash and the steep job losses of both foreign and native workers in 2000 and 2001.  You see, a strong job LOSS in both groups is mathematically identical to a strong job GAIN of both groups, at least as far as the linear regression that determines the job change is concerned.  If the study's interest is the effect of an increase in foreign STEM workers, 2002 to 2009 is a much more appropriate period and this period is associated with a job LOSS.\n\nAll of this shows that you need to check that studies that you or your readers reference have been replicated and validated.  The fact that an economist has put their name on it is meaningless unless the study has been reviewed and validated, preferably by researchers on all sides of the issue.  In my view, the most credible evidence suggests that current policies lower wages and job opportunities for native workers.  For this reason, I am very much against the STEM OPT extension.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2014","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by R.

Considering the situation that the H1 B VISA for F1 students is based on a lottery system, the employer will not take the risk of hiring people that cannot possibly stay longer than one year or nine months if they did not get H1 VISA for the first time, which means that a F1 student can hardly find any training opportunities in the 90 days opt period. The employers are from the market and their first purpose is to make profit, they consider candidates for bringing profit not being trained.\n3. Students being extended will not cause any problem to the society. In fact they contribute to the job market and help improve economics. They are all educated people with desent jobs.\n4. The United Stated of America is an immigration country. It is the best country because it absorbs all the best people in the world. It opens doors for the people that are talented and need opportunities.

Using foreign STEM students in the OPT program is just away to gain cheap labor at the expense of similarly qualified citizen students who will remain in the US and benefit our own country.  The OPT program, aside from taking money out of our country also provides a pathway for foreigners to remain in our country.  Immigration is a very sensitive and controversial issue and this program seems to be another way for foreigners to get around our immigration laws.  It also seems to me that those STEM students who qualify for the OPT program are most likely from countries that already have a thriving technology industry and will, maybe, be marginally affected by these students when and if they do return to their country.

Summary of the Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action\n\nThe proposal would again provide for an extension of OPT for certain F-1 students with STEM degrees. As compared to the 2008 IFR, the proposed rule includes the following changes:\nLengthened STEM Extension Period for OPT. The proposal would increase the OPT extension period for STEM OPT students from the 2008 IFR's 17 months to 24 months. The proposal would also make F-1 students who subsequently enroll in a new academic program and earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level eligible for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension.\" \n\n\nI strongly agree with that it will benefit international student a lot by having a 24 months OPT extension instead of 17months. Due the the H1B lottery situation that gets worse and worse every year, i have many international friends who have to leave US just because they did not win the H1B lottery for two times in two years. They had full time job in US and they did really good jobs so it is really unfair and sad for them to leave just because they don't have luck. By extending OPT extension to 24 months. A lot people will be able to get another chance to win the H1B lottery and get to stay in US for a longer time!

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \nI was glad to see the proposed rule for re instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. \nThe proposal to re institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. \nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. \nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 36-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 48 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience. \nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period. \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new immediately. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter. \nSincerely,\nRishi Pathak\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2980","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rishi Pathak"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This article is totally positive for American economy and the students mutually.

These skills, like Internet Security, Mechanical Engineering, Geographic Information Science and many others, are highly demanded skills in the current job market. In other words, the job market is in short supply of excellent candidates. By 2020, employment in all computer occupations is expected to increase by 22%, but some IT fields will fare better than others, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) biennial update of employment projections. Providing STEM students longer timeframe would gave them a better chance to fulfill these demands in the job market. As the companies could find better candidates, they would have more economic contribution to the nation and pay more tax.\n\nSTEM graduates, who turn from bachelor to master or PhD candidates, will increase the overall labor quality of the nation when they are entering the job market. A labor population with better quality is critical to a nations economic growth. People with little education could only work for some basic jobs, while people with high education could work in high-tech sectors. The nation definitely do not want the major industry be the agriculture and manufacturing. Services industry is what the US is wanted. It is a few pollution, high profit margin, sustainable and environmental friendly industry. STEM subjects are exactly parallel with the services industry. With STEM students have more time to be authorized to work in the service industry, the more the US economy would be benefited from the enhanced labor population. \n\nMore time for STEM students work for the America would also help US to enhance its worlds leader position. The country has been a leader in a lot of fields in the world, and many of them are exactly STEM subjects like IT, medicine, engineering and science. Let STEM students work for a longer time in these fields would bring more diversity to the working and researching environment, as well as efficiency and energy. No field would achieve success if no one succeed. With STEM students continuing to push human beings discovering the nature, building better infrastructure, more secure and efficient web environment, the country would be benefited from that, with a stable and unshakable position as the world leader.\n\nSomeone may think these STEM students are taking opportunities away from the current citizens. I do not agree with that. Opportunities are only available to those who are prepared, and they are not affected by others. This country is a place that everyone has equal rights. There is no affection for non-citizen at all in the job market. Provided two candidates have exactly the same knowledge, a citizen would definitely get the job compared with a STEM student because of the no cost in work authorization management. If a person loses or could not get his / her job, it is not caused by STEM students but he / she is not qualified. We should not blame personal disqualification to STEM students. The STEM extension will be a good example of the Immigration revolution of the Obama government, even though F-1 students are only a tiny part of non-immigration legal residence in the American land.\n\nIn conclusion, STEM students with 24 months extension would increase the average education level of the labor population, bring more knowledge and benefits to US companies and economy, and lead to a more stable world leader positon of the United States of America.\n\nGod blesses the America.\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, as a STEM student who just start to work under OPT, I found my value could be used for the people, the government in this country. As a contractor of the USDA, I used my GIS knowledge learned from my Master degree to help the agency. My job duty is to do Python scripting, Geoprocessing management, publishing geoprocessing models and maps. These products will be used within the different department of agency. Some of them are used by field operators to monitor the conservation of easement. Some of them would help the field to have a better and faster planning process. Of course, some of them are solely to make the current workflow more efficient within the agency. I felt that Im blessed to have a chance to use my professional knowledge learnt from my Master degree to help the conservation of natural lands. I do not want to lose this chance to better serve the people, the America if I have to go back to my home country as the H1-B visa is way too much hard to obtain.\n\nI fully SUPPORT DHS decision to give 24 moths extension of F-1 students. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0157","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Simon Suo"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Really look forward for this to take effective.

The experience is so valuable that can have a huge positive impact on one's life. On the other hand, this new rules also give huge benefits to U.S economy and industry and it helps the U.S to stay competitive among all the other countries in the world. As for me, I am currently pursuing a master degree in computer science at University of Southern California. In our school, viterbi school of engineering, majority of the students are foreigners and it is also the case for faculties and researchers. Thanks to STEM-OPT, people from other places in the world with a smart mind can see themselves practice what they learn in the school and even make huge innovations and contributions to U.S after finishing the school.  Anyway, I think 24 months is fairly good amount of time. However, I do think DHS should place a wage requirement for STEM OPT extension, which means to be qualified for opt-ext, wage should be above certain threshold to make sure the company is not exploiting the students. Another reason is that, if the wage is too low, let us say, around 12 dollars per hour, it might imply the student is not practicing his or her knowledge in STEM fields.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1842","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Haozhe Xu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As one who has had to train their Indian replacement, I can't see how foreigners know more than Americans when we have to train them.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\t\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\tthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\t\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\t\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them.

It would allow more time for prospective employers to decide if they want to file H1 visa for the candidate. It would also give much more time for students earn more and give them a good chance to return to their native countries. It will also decrease pressure on H1 visa applications, as students get more time, by 48 months they might want to return instead of staying for few more years by filing for H1.\n\nIf OPT extension is only for 24 months they are good chances for students preferring to stay back and file H1 instead of leaving to their ow countries. This might in turn effect opportunities for US citizens.\n\n24 months is good , but not enough.

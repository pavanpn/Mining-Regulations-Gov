If we dont fulfill this quickly, there will be lots of negative effects appearing in different fields. I will present those in the following:\n\n1.\tIn the short term, a short OPT can severely decrease the possibility of companies hiring new graduate students. As we know, most international students are willing to study in the US, because they can receive better education, and the most important, they can find a job and stay in their dream country after graduation. If the OPT period is short or the OPT extension is terminated, thousands of international students will not continue their education in US, who have already gave big financial support for US universities.   \nBesides that, most tech companies in US will need more efforts to hire suitable employees from colleges, which will increase their operation cost.\n\n2.\tIn the long term, without the contribution from international students, universities in US will lose not only tuition income, but also talent resources. This scenario will lower their standards and suffer a drop in reputation and overall quality, which in turn make them less attractive to international genius. It becomes a vicious cycle! Then the US education will be down.\nFrom the perspective of industry, the decreasing of potential employees from new college graduate, will affect the quality of job market. To compete with other foreign companies globally, US companies must move their high tech departments to China or India, who have sufficient hi-tech labor. Otherwise those big companies like Google/Facebook/Apple/Intel would lose competitiveness, so as to bankrupt. As a result, its obviously that the job positions will be cut down accordingly. \nFurthermore, those side effects will make US lose her lead in technologies, and finally US cannot beat China/Germany/India in all fields.\n\nIn summary, Im happy to hear that 17-month OPT extension can be 24 months or more. As an immigrant country, the US should continually welcome more international genius, so that they can help keep her leading position in military, art, economy, medical, education, etc.\n\nThank you!\n\nBest regards,\nColin\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1467","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Colin Wei"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"NO MORE FORIEGN WORKERS OR STUDENTS!

Don't you realize every STEM graduate from another country will displace an American graduate? What chance does a minority or lower income American graduate who busted their butt to get a STEM degree from a \"lesser\" university have against a foreign graduate from MIT? American students will justifiably not pursue a STEM degree in the future if they don't have a chance of getting a job. What will that do to America?\n\nThe software giants who are pushing for this legislation can easily hire a STEM graduate from a foreign country in their existing offshore locations in India, China, etc. Also, there is no shortage of American STEM workers. Look at the unemployment statistics and you'll see this. If there were a shortage, wages in this area would be going up. They've been flat for many years now.\n\nAnother affected group will be older American STEM workers (in this field, 40+ is older). They will be displaced by foreign STEM graduates.\n\nIf you think this policy is a good idea then why not bring in the best steelworkers, electricians, politicians, etc from other countries as well and displace even more Americans?\n\nAmerica seems to be the only country in the world that fails to protect its own workers.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3377","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jim Klecka"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think extending the STEM for OPT students is a helpful idea.

First of all, technology companies need people especially STEM students. And the market of technology is a central market for U.S., this is a huge benefit for global technology improvement since U.S. is a leader for technique. In additional, it is very good for American economy. Second, with an extension, STEM students can obtain more experience rather than struggle with OPT, which can helps STEM students acquire the skill sets they want to contribute their country when they go back home. That will make OPT valuable, even the colleges of U.S. can bring more international students which can expand the influence of U.S. colleges.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0638","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Can Gao, UCSC"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support this.

It is high time we began hiring American students, graduates and young professionals who are unemployed or underemployed right here on our soil. This is nothing more than another avenue for big corps to save on salaries (7-10%) thus fattening their bottom line. While I am all for making a profit, the savings are minor when compared to the ethical and logical choice of hiring these professionals from a pool of qualified AMERICANS. Lastly, expanding programs like these only works to discourage young students from pursuing these careers - a double edge sword if I ever saw one.

Providing a 24 month extension to students with stem degree will be really beneficial for both international students as well as USA. International students will be forced out of the country when their OPT expires given their H1-B visa is not picked. This rule will allow them to stay in the country, give them multiple attempts in the H1-B visa lottery and eventually contribute towards the growth of the county. Students should get multiple attempts in the H1-B visa lottery because it should not be their luck, but it should be their talent that decides their future. Students who complete their Masters in US should have some advantage in H1-B lottery because they have spent their parent's hard earned money towards their education which has contributed towards the economy of USA. This 24 months extension will not be a complete solution but it will at least solve some problems by giving multiple attempts towards H1-B visa. With the quality of education being given to the students here in USA, international students should be retained and should be allowed to contribute to the country where they gained knowledge rather then forcing them to go back to their home country and serving some other country. This rule will not affect US students because most of the companies prefer to hire citizens and permanent residents because of work authorization issues with internationals. Whereas other companies pick better candidates from a pool of all students (local or international). Also there should be limit in people applying for H1-B visas from foreign countries and no limit to students with their degrees in USA. People who have never contributed anything are allowed to work freely whereas students to spend their parent's money in expensive and prestigious universities are forced out of the country.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2797","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Atif Ansari"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe if approved, there would be a huge economy booming coming along with the extension.

They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. A great example should be the new Google's CEO Sundar Pichai who leaded the team to develop Google Chrome which not only helped Google earns huge amount of profit but also drove a tremendous increase in US tech industry.

I have nothing against  OPT/H1B visas but DHS should check the misuse of OPT visas and H1B visas done by the consultancies/employers.\n\nMassive visa fraud is happening in the broad day light done by Indian consultancies. These so called Indian employers fake their resume and select candidates who are in OPT claiming that they have H1B visa. They run fake pay rolls and hire mostly Indian grads from US universities who can't even speak proper English. These so called consultancies get projects from companies(subcontracted by them)  by showing  that they have a very strong experienced workforce with 5-10 years experience. Most of the interviews with contractors are done through Skype and questions are answered by an experienced guy who will be on loudspeaker during the interview. While the actual candidate will lip sync to proxy candidate's reply to interviewers questions. Companies have hired thousands of fake candidates like this and some of them got fired. Consultancies/employers will lose that job contract as a result of this. But they will continue doing this as a candidate with US degree is their cash cow. These companies won't do background check properly and a person with a fake profile joins them. Within a span of 1 month they will be caught and kicked out. Some lucky ones stay there with the help of skilled proxies. These fake candidates will share their laptop screens with proxy worker sitting in India and get this work done. There are lots of fraudulent practices happening without the notice of officials and the industry.\n\nRecent examples are raids conducted by DHS on couple of Indan IT consultancy firms based in California and New Jersey. They arrested some Indian entrepreneurs who ran fake pay roll and employed candidates with fake experience.  If you check the number of H1B visa applications you will realize the shocking number of applications that were duplicated by these con men. \n\nWithin a year, the H1B applications will overflow to  300,000 numbers because most of these consultancies will put 3-4 applications to get their H1B selected. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and other companies that apply for more than thousands of H1 visa applications should be investigated as such companies employ less than 30 percent American citizens. \n\nAs an American citizen, I am fed up of these consultancies and fake candidates.   Because of their fraudulent activities many companies don't trust Indian graduates. It's become a stereotype that an Indian students always cheats in exams, fakes their resume and get jobs which should be given to genuinely experienced candidates.\n\n This brain drain concept  is completely ridiculous. I don't believe that USA as a great country needs foreign graduates to save economy or future of this country.  Most of the foreign students especially Indian  and chinese are here to make money and they don't come here to create jobs or create intelligent kids to save United States. It's a shame that United States as a great country can't control such frauds from taking advantage of this system. Please do a thorough investigation on such people and make OPT rules strict to prevent such malpractices by consultancies. \n\nIt is also important to save American jobs for American people. I would like to recommend that any employer should call foreign graduates only after they have interviewed a specific number of American candidates to make sure that the priority is  given to American citizens.  Please do the needful to stop these fraud Indian consultancies. Rather than giving OPT visas to all students who graduate here in USA, you should implement a system where  students with good academic credentials directly benefit from  system. Those who fake their credentials should be punished by cancelling the OPT and deporting them back to where they came from. \n\nPlease strictly enforce OPT visa holders to work in their corresponding fields they have their degrees based on. Recently, I have noticed that many of the mechanical engineering grads started working with these IT consultancies with fake profile and fake experience. Please take necessary steps to avoid such issues in future. Please stop them from changing companies during the OPT period. This will make sure that those who fake resumes to join a company will pay the price eventually. Stop graduates working with fake experience and taking away American jobs!! \n\n\nTo avoid faking resumes and profiles by these con artists, I hereby request  DHS to enforce background check rules on these candidates before they even start their jobs. If you don't take care of concerns raised by American workers like me eventually this rule will be thrown out by another judge in the court. So I hope you'll address my concerns to implement a strong rule to avoid such fraudulent activities by foreign graduates and Indian consultancies. \n\n\nGod Bless United States of America!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1549","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Thomas Hayden"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Yes I fully support extending the OPT to 24 months as this gives the foreign students good exposure and an opportunity to exercise their knowledge.

We actually created many of the technologies involved.  We do NOT need people from India or any other third world country to do our tech for us.  \n\nRight now, talented, experienced American STEM workers are losing their jobs to upstarts from overseas.  Americans who paid the absurdly high costs of higher education so they could do skilled work for good money are being bypassed in favor of foreigners who will work for less.  Often the foreigners are not very good at doing the work, but nobody seems to care about that.\n\nI know what I'm talking about here because my husband is a STEM worker in Silicon Valley, and has been for the past decade.  He has seen more and more jobs off-shored to India.  He is currently working for a company that is in disarray--its stock prices have dropped by 40%--because so many projects are being done by workers in India who have poor technical ability and an even poorer understanding of concepts like taking responsibility for your own work performance, meeting deadlines, and so on.  American business culture does not magically bloom overnight in exotic locales.  Cheap foreign labor is no bargain if the workers can't or won't do the job.  And when those same workers come to the USA, they bring their sub-par skills and lackadaisical work ethic with them.\n\nUnlike Americans, Indians have no problem with showing loyalty to \"their own kind.\"  When Indian workers are hired into an American tech firm, they take every opportunity to bring in more Indian workers.  The result is that  hiring of Indians snowballs, with departments and companies becoming nearly all-Indian in composition.  Americans' naive multiculturalism is a form of suicide when pitted against the traditional in-group loyalty practiced by nearly every other population on Earth.\n\nThe USA is slipping from dominance in many areas where we used to crush the competition.  Let's not lose our pre-emminence in STEM.  Stop undermining American STEM workers.  They are the best in the world!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3661","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Diana Blackwell"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT) is one of many programs that undermines the US citizen who seeks work in his or her own country.

As a former university professor myself, I do not understand why any university would be interested in ensuring additional revenues for scholarship funds for American students if they can find full-freight tuition paying (often in cash) foreigners: despite the current Administration's rhetoric about making college available to all, this program merely makes it all the less incentivized for colleges to fund American students or high tech to hire them.

The younger daughter was also unable to find a full time position in this country and has opted to use her UK citizenship (courtesy of her father, a UK citizen) and move to England, where she got a job within a month. I have other examples of US citizen engineering graduates unable to find positions. Yet, living in the Seattle area and walking near Microsoft and Amazon headquarters the vast majority of people I see are Indian and Asian, speaking a heavily accented English or in Chinese - these are NOT native born individuals. Until there is truly a shortage of STEM graduates, there should NOT be an effort to make it easier for foreigners to stay/work here. Instead, the timeframe they are allowed to work in this country should be reduced. Ideally, they would get their degree here and then return to their country to improve it. From what I understand, companies are hiring foreign nationals because they are cheaper which results in depressed wages for others, are willing to work ridiculously long hours, and not \"make waves\". These are not character traits that will make this country strong and dynamic but will enrich American executives - to the detriment of the US children, raised with American values and work/social ethics. I have no interest in living in China or India, but feel like that's were I'm headed due to the huge influx of foreign nationals.

It will be really helpful to students in gaining valuable experience after they complete their studies. I think the proposed regulation should also take into consideration students who, after completing their STEM degrees, worked one year on OPT, and then instead of extending their STEM extension, went on to pursue another degree - STEM or non-STEM. For example, if someone has completed a Masters in Information Systems (a STEM degree), then worked one year on his/her OPT and, then instead of extending of going for STEM extension, enrolled in a Masters of Business Administration degree (another Masters degree but non-STEM). Such students will be able to mix their STEM as well as non-STEM knowledge in order to gain new skills and develop their leadership talent, an opportunity which is hard to gain otherwise. \nThanks.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2185","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Satish Kumar"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly recommend this proposed rule, This is a long awaited rule and should've been implemented much earlier.

Retaining students who graduate from US universities will surely be a boost to the tech industry here rather than causing them to leave which is a Brain Drain.

Foreign students would have to work harder to get a job after graduation, because students would stay longer and have more opportunities to search for a job. In the meantime, the job opportunities at the same period of time should stay almost the same, therefore, students who have more professional skills would find the job and stay in America, improving the overall productivity in America. On the other hand, domestic students will face bigger pressure to find a job, therefore they would work harder, improving the overall productivity, too.\n\nThe second reason for agreeing to this expansion is that this would not necessarily lead to every foreign students would choose to stay in America. People sometimes worry about foreign students would stay in America and that seems to not protect Americans. This is not really the case. Nowadays people go back to their own country for different reasons. For example, as I am a student, if I have a chance to stay in the US, I probably would stay, but it also depends on my own family. If my family want me to go back to my own country, I would probably choose to go back even if I can stay in America.\n\nThis third reason to expand the legal staying period is that people can learn more and may have more contribution to their own country when they go back, therefore, improving the productivity and contribution to the world, which is the ultimate goal for studying abroad. As known to all, Americans have the state-of-the-art education in the world and most competitive working environment and highest technologies in the world. Foreign students would gain more living, working and language skills after spending longer time here. After they go back to their own country, these skills would improve their productivity and leads to improvement for their own country. \n\nTherefore, I strongly agree with the expansion.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1101","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jie Yang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I object to this proposal as it appears to be a blatant circumventing of the H1-B cap, usurping the legislation of our congressional representation.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1154","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Denise Morrissette"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I agree with the new improving rules for F-1 Nonimmigrant student, We spend two or more years study here should have more time to use our skills to make benefit for US.

Graduates can work without being bogged down by complexities of obtaining a speciality occupation visa\n- EAD makes recent foreign graduates attractive to employers who have some appetite for hiring people fresh out of school but do not want to invest heavily upfront in them. Employers are able to take chances and dip into a larger pool of graduates and scholars\n- It lets students in Schools remain focused on what they came to the US in first place - to study and research without thinking too much about if they have to pack their bags and move out soon after graduation. One year in OPT is not nearly enough to allow people fresh out of school to employ their skills and find their calling. Like the great education schools in US impart, it is equally important to get a great grounding at work before students can go out on their own, to their home countries or anywhere in the world and do justice to their education and investments. Experience in US benefits the students, the society and organizations of all sizes in US.\n\nThere is another large pool of students in US, who are also non resident aliens but who are not on F-1 visas. They are partners of primary beneficiaries of workers in specialty occupations. Partners on H-4 and L-2, for example, or the beneficiaries of H-1 and L-1B visas themselves. While they may be attending school full time, they do not get the benefit of an OPT after earning their degrees. OPT and CPT should be extended to such students as well, to allow them to use their education gained in US without being chained by their visa classifications. There is a large pool of such dependent partners that goes to schools and works as hard, if not more, as students on F-1, but is deprived of an opportunity to be gainfully employed just because of their visa classification. H-4 EAD is a step in right direction, but offering OPT to students irrespective of their visa classifications only truly benefits all international students who work hard to make their dreams come true some day.\n\nAnother important aspect that DHS should look at is prevention of fraud in education industry. Especially, schools for profit that may be shops for obtaining a CPT and OPT while adding little value to students who fall victim to the lure of getting a work permit by enrolling in such schools. In the long run, students are deprived of quality education while racking up huge bills for tuition. Measures to prevent such abuse will all the more be needed with proposed extension of OPT work permit.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1943","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous (K.

Make sure the new rule comes into effect from Feb 15th 2016.Otherwise employers will be pissed off, when the student on F1-visa says he/she can't work for few months. The project in the organization has deadlines and resources are expected to complete their tasks on time.\nHence I strongly request DHS to fix this rule and make it effective on time, so that employers and as well as employees are not impacted.\n2. Increase the OPT period to 36 months. Then only it will give enough time for students to learn things on the job training.24 months is not sufficient because of the high competition for H1B visa's(Obviously employer will not be willing to lose the resource, since organization has spent lot of time & money in training the person). So employers want to make use of the trained and skilled resource and if 36 months is given, then both parties will have enough time to get H1B from this heavy competitive lottery.\nNext:\nPeople working on OPT doesn't come cheaply for organizations. Employers advertise for job positions and since they are not able to find Native American's with those skills, they go for international students with the cost of sponsoring them visas. So my point is, international students are not pulling the jobs of American's by working for fewer wage.(Average American Indian house hold income is 90K and the average American income is 40K). This tells immigrants don't get jobs because they are cheap, but they get jobs since they are needed.\nOn an average international student spends 1 year on writing GRE, TOFEL, Appling for universities, getting visa and on top of that paying extra fee to study. He/she works hard on an average of 3 years to complete their education and at the end most of the campus placement companies says; sorry we are not hiring people, who need sponsorship. Then people start applying; through job portals and end up getting one call for every 100 job applications. This employer conducts 3 to 4 rounds of interview and finally selects the student, because they were not able to find anyone from market. All of a sudden, some tech organization sues the rules made by agencies and employers are frustrated with hiring international students because of immigration policies.\nSo employers loose talent people and loose the competitive edge over their competitors who have MNC companies. When there is no competition, you get trash not cream. America imports oil from Saudi Arabia, Cars from Japan, TV's from Korea, whisky from Scotland, smart brains from India. So immigrants are not doing harm to citizens of America, they are helping to create jobs, improve the economy of the country, filling the needs of the country by sacrificing the livelihood with their families back in their own countries.\nSo I humbly request DHS to implement this new rule by Feb 15th 2016 and provide the stem opt for 36 months. Thanks for providing this opportunity to voice our opinions.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1576","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Naveen P."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Support!

I also believe that students currently on STEM Extensions should not be impacted if the rule does not go in place by February 12, 2016. This will cause unnecessary gaps in employment and will prove to be unnecessarily complicated for USCIS to rescind approved work authorizations. \n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2013 with a master's degree in the field of Digital Media from New York University. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \n\nIn April 2008, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued an interim final rule with request for comments that extended the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrants with a qualifying STEM degree. On August 12, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the 17-month STEM extension created by the 2008 Rule, but ordered that the vacatur be stayed until February 12, 2016. If DHS does not issue a final rule to replace the 2008 Rule, thousands of foreign students with work authorizations, such as myself, will be forced to scramble to depart the United States. This will impose a costly burden on the U.S. tech sector if thousands of young workers have to leave their jobs on February 12, 2016. \n\nForeign students represent half of all U.S. graduate enrollments in engineering, math, and computer science. There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Master's degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit. \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers. \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by extending the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees through a new rule submitted for proper notice and comment by February 12, 2016. \n\n\nThank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSaranya Kapur","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0705","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Saranya Kapur"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am totally against this it makes no sense.\n\t\"there is no training in this program.

But, it's glad to hear government is fighting as hard as they can to help our international students.\n\nI believe the original STEM OPT rule was published under emergency act for a reason. From what I learned by researching, the U.S. was under economic depression and they want to keep the talents that American education system trained so that they could contribute to the economy.\n\nThe U.S. economy is recovering in the recent years partly because it's a world known impression that the U.S. is the best place for people around the world that who have talent and want to pursue their dreams.  People come here to study, to gain practical experience and meanwhile to contribute to the country and its economy. This is also the way how the U.S. established from a colony to a modern country of freedom.\n\nIt will look bad for the U.S. government if the government fails to protect the rights/dreams of those international students. Because talents around the world will hold their step, and think they could be abandoned and urged away anytime if some organizations who are less competent (statistics shows that international students are not underpaid) but have ancestors came to the country earlier than them can \"exile\" them. If the U.S. would like to keep its leading role in S.T.E.M. areas, there has to be some law and rules that not only protect those international talents' rights but also attract more talents from all over the world. \n\nThis proposed 24 months STEM OPT is an inspiring act of government showing their will and faith in protecting our international young talents and attracting more talents. This rule can benefit the U.S. in a lot of ways and I barely see any negative impact.

It is also not fair for those engineers who spend a lot of time to get their education in America and hope to make contributions to the country.\n\nSo all in all, I think approving OPT Extension is a win-win to everyone.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1276","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Siyu Cong"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Enough already with these foreign workers when our citizens have a hard time finding a job!

I learnt a lot and was hoping that I could keep my journey here in the Bay area as an engineer. Things may not be an issue if it was 10 years ago that after one year of OPT I could apply for the H1B visa and could most likely get approved. However, today the applicants of H1B are more than it could serve. This is the objective fact that I can not change. However, there are two facts that I feel it is urgent to extend the opt to in total 3 years for STEM. First of all, even with the heated competition in obtaining H1B, there are still some consulting companies in bay area who applied for several H1Bs for one applicant just to expand the chance of the lottery. I feel this is highly unfair and hope this issue be attended to. Under this situation, it is less likely that one can get H1B within one year. Once we do not get it, there is a large quantity of employees the company needs to relocate which is highly inefficient and expensive. With the extended opt, this will relieve the pressure on our shoulder as well as the companies. Secondly, it is widely known that most of the companies in bay area rely on the foreign employees. If they only have one year of opt, even the fresh graduate got hired, after one year they will no long be able to maintain their position and will greatly affect the functionality of the company. I always think that the most attractive mindset that the US government has is its open arm to the outside world. This makes you competitive and outstanding. Thus I highly suggest that you should extend the opt to in total 3 years for STEM.

In fact, they are creating local jobs. Whoever would want to sponsor an H1 visa in cash, if there are competent citizens available? It is doubtful if the jobs can be passed into local hands when the current holders are expelled. They are more likely to remain vacant for a while. A direct consequence is the inflation in labor cost driven by this desperate thirst. Humble enterprises will soon appear on the list of casualty. The state will find its economic engine running out of fuel, but that is not the end of the trouble. There shall be a shrinking local consumer market. People living on the payroll of local industry indirectly by offering service to its employees will also have their jobs at risk. This is indeed a paradox. \n\nAs a footnote, let me share a few thoughts about the history of Rome, the model of this country in many aspects. The republic at its peak embraced all sort of talents regardless of their origin. Novi homines like Marius and Cicero reshaped the military and the cultural tradition of that nation. Even in her declining years, the empire survived for several hundred years only in the protection of \"barbarian\" mercenaries when all youths of Italy gave up in indulgence their ancestors' martial virtues. The question should not be whether foreigners are to be expelled, but rather how to assimilate them to serve this great country with loyalty.

Americas most prominent and successful companies hire thousands of international STEM graduates from US universities. We provide a ton of value to the economy. Most of us stay on once our H1B visa gets selected in the lottery, and we provide a lot of long-term benefit to American companies.\n\n2. The H1B lottery has a low success rate. Not passing the STEM extension would give us only one attempt towards getting the visa. I didnt get selected in the lottery this year. By simple probability, we need at least three attempts to be guaranteed an H1B visa.\n\n3. The OPT STEM extension is a great way to attract the brightest minds from around the world to study at American universitiesvery few students would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to come study at American universities if it didnt guarantee at least 2.5 years of practical training at the end.\n\n4. International students like us are not stealing American jobs. I work for a top tech company as a Software Engineer, and I can tell you firsthand that it is extremely difficult to attract, hire and retain top STEM talent. There simply arent enough Americans who can do STEM jobs. Most, if not all international US university STEM grads who work here end up being successful in their career. This, in turn, creates a lot more jobs for Americans and internationals alike. If Im successful and bring a lot of value to my company, it will generate more revenue for the company, and they can use that to grow their organization. Therefore it is a win-win situation for everybody.\n\n5. As an engineer at a top tech company, I pay tens of thousands of dollars in tax to Uncle Sam every year. I also spend tens of thousands of dollars to live in the US. Not incentivizing us to stay in the country will only cause us to find greener pastures elsewhereI could get a job as a Software Engineer at a company abroad, and contribute to their economythis would mean loss of taxes to the US government, among other things.\n\n6. In President Obamas wordsMore fundamentally, the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are going through the process of immigrating legally. In theory, if I wanted to become an American citizen, I would need to wait 18.5 years(2 years for H1B, 11 years for Green Card, 5.5 years for citizenship). Compare this to ~6 years if you illegally walked across the US border.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would like for the USCIS to not only pass this rule, but also consider expanding H1B visa availability for STEM graduates of US universities. We were trained by your professors (most of whom were immigrants themselves), and we spent thousands of dollars coming to America to get access to opportunity and provide a lot of value in return. We need to bring reform to this broken immigration system. Highly skilled immigrant workers like myself should not have to struggle through the various hoops of the immigration system remain in this country.\n\nScripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a strangerwe were strangers once, too. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.President Obama\n\nThank you,\nAniruddh Chaturvedi","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2201","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Aniruddh Chaturvedi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Opt stem is so important.

Below are facts that need to be considered and answered before this proposed rule is re-reviewed.   \n\nINFORMATION FOR REVIEW:\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\n    OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n    OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n    \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\n    the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n    \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS:\nI am disappointed that my own government and my own citizens would consider such a rule that undermines the American dream, greatness and worse of all, its' own citizen.\n\nThis rule should not be considered.   It is more treasonous and devastating then the words convey.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3329","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by David Calvetti"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My wife and I are opposed to this action. Below are some of the reasons why:\n\n    The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n   It Gives employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n      Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said (in a letter to President Obama):\n     \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    The proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country.

However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n      Richard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n     \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n    \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\n      David North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:\n      \"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n    \"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n    \"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n   \n      Ron Hira of Howard University:\n     \"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.\"\n   \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3843","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Marion La Violette"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This sound great for the foreign students.

Currently STEM Ext students get 1 more chance for H1B and that may ruin career as it's totally depend on luck. Lottery system is too luck driven than performance driven and that is not fair to anyone who has done hardships to complete masters and get job in stipulated time allowed. If probability of losing out on lottery chance is counted - this efforts will go in vain and student may not opt to come to higher studies to US as immigration is lottery based rather than being performance or point based. Lot of talent has returned back or opted for other countries where point based system gives more value to their profile.

I see that the mentoring and training plan is required for OPT extension. The reason that strikes me as odd is - anyone applying for OPT extension has already used up 12 months of practical training and is only then allowed to apply for extension. This means that the student has been working for at least 6 months (if we consider the 120 days requirement for applying for extension). Generally an employee will rarely undergo more than 6 months training and mentoring. So asking for a mentoring plan which will be applicable when the student has already been working for 12 months when the extension becomes valid, does not seem a practical plan.\nA student at the beginning of his/her career would benefit more from a plan rather than mid-way.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1719","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Monali  Mishra"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The extension is good for the US.

The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.\n\nFinally, the Regulations fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations.

No doubt about this, if this proposal finally passed smoothly \nthen both STEM students and US will be really benefited from this OPT rules.\nDHS have done really good work within this short period of time.\n\nBut I want to highlight few points about this proposal where DHS should \nrethink to change little bit of proposal rules in few areas before prepare \na final rule to give a real sense of F1 OPT extension rules both for \nSTEM/NON-STEM catagory students to overcome the current H1B quota limitation \nproblem.\n\n1. I think that as per current OPT extension proposal, DHS intension is to \n   keep details track record about employees, employers and US university's, \n   so DHS can able to monitor every process in right track or not. But it \n   may be created a complexity to maintain the document from vice-versa. \n   So I am requesting to DHS, please try to find out easy documentation methods \n   which can be reduced the documentation over burden process for related \n   concerned sectors.\n\n\n2. Secondly my view is that current DHS OPT extension proposal have one\n   sided means they have extend 24 months OPT period only for STEM category.\n   It is no doubt that US need STEM people due to shortage of STEM manpower.\n   But non immigrant NON-STEM master degree holder like MBA want to contribute\n   their experience with vast experience after MBA to improve US economy\n   and revenue and also start their business in USA. But  they only get 12 months \n  OPT period after MBA  which is really very shortage time  to get H1B visa due to \n  unexpected smaller number of H1B quota as per current\n   manpower demand due to improvement of US economy. I know one person after\n   completed MBA from US university, now he have started business in Canada,\n   because he was unfortunate guy not able to pick up H1B visa due to lottery\n   system method.\n\n   Although current non-stem degree holder like MBA can enjoy 24 months OPT\n   extension as per current OPT proposal rules provided if he/she have done \n   STEM degree from US university before MBA and also OPT extension must \n   previous stem degree related. In reality, most of the MBA students will \n   like to work in Management segment to work with their analytic mind and\n   complex business solution problem. On the other side, very few international\n   students have done BS/MS in stem from US university before MBA. If we see the \n   statistics about international MBA profile in USA, then we will see most of \n   the international students have done their stem degree from their home country \n   and after 4-5 years practical experience in various industry, they take an \n   admission in MBA in US university to contribute expertise of their experience in \n   business management area as well as to get global business exposure or analytic \n   in management or start their business in USA and ultimately US economy will get\n   benefit.\n\n   So my request to DHS if they allow at least to non-us stem degree holder to get an\n   opportunity for 12 months OPT extension if 24 months is not possible then they \n   can contribute their experience what they have learned from us business \n   school to US companies for 1 year more and increase their chance to get H1B visa \n   for second time.\n\n   At last we want to say that please consider my above points and draw a final proposal\n   so nobody will be deprived from this OPT extension opportunity and it will be real\n   sense of immigration change to some extent until & unless H1B quota is to be increased.\n   and also must monitor no american employees will be effected from any types abuse \n   from this proposal. \n  \n   With Thanks & Regards\n\n  Swapan Mukherjee\n\n\n   \n   \t  ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Swapan Mukherjee"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I greatly appreciate this new rule making for the following reasons:\n\n1. Currently US economy is in pretty good shape with most of the tech firms reporting positive results. Without proposed rule for OPT extension, there will be a sudden unrest to the whole STEM field related businesses and we don't want that.\n\n2. This rule give all the STEM OPT employers time and chance to plan their work assignments. They would know that the OPT employee would be there for more time and they can invest in them. \n\n3. Complexity of the STEM jobs is getting more and more complex everyday. Due to this, just a single year of OPT is not beneficial for employer as well as student. It takes time for a newly hired person to understand the whole complexity. With STEM extension, employer would have a guarantee that the OPT worker will still be there in the firm after the initial expensive training.\n\n4. This rule is essential for holding on to the young and fresh graduates who might have a great business idea, a great concept which is not implemented because of the Visa issues. \n\n5. Highly skilled professional have created numerous jobs and billion dollar businesses in the United States of America. Today, all the students who wish to invent something look forward to the USA for better opportunities. If this rule doesn't go through, this might change forever. Students will avoid coming to US as rules won't be favorable as they are now. \n\n6. Generally when a student graduates and lands a job, he/she would spend a good amount knowing  there will be a substantial continuous income thereafter. If OPT extension is revoked, students won't spend much during their OPT year, since they might end up losing job a year later. This kind of slows the currency flow in the country. \n\n   For keeping everything smooth and not disturbing what is great for both OPT students and US as country, I strongly recommend this rule. \n ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2057","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Amit Patil"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is crucial for the US to keep the talent rather than forcing them away for US to keep leading the world.

It will be a huge loss of talents and innovations for our nation, which leads to a huge loss for our economy.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0489","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ellen Ma"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\tDHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n\t\"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\"\n\t\"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\nWHEN, WHEN WILL AMERICAN CITIZENS BE PROTECTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT?\n\nJUST ANOTHER NASTY CHEAP TRICK PLAY ON AMERICAN CITIZENS.\n\nWHEN WILL THIS NONSENSE EVER END?\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3280","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Janet Peterson"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am  opposed to DHS proposed rule to expand OPT","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3747","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Gordon Evans"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" I hope this will be true because i am currently a graduate student majoring computer science .

My daughter got her Bachelors and Masters Degrees, by working hard and paying her own way 100%, because her mother and I couldn't afford to fund the cost of her education. And she was denied any financial assistance just because we owned a home and had a livable income? The \"Dream Act\" was the start of a miserable disbursement of hard working taxpayer monies to foreign nationals, and continues to expand with this and other free-bee giveaway programs. When is the AMERICAN government going to put the welfare of the AMERICAN society first? Your proposal is shameful at best, and a needless waste of AMERICAN taxpayers money at worst. Here are some reasons you shouldn't implement this program:\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nThe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\"\nSTART AND FINISH BY PUTTING AMERICAN CITIZENS FIRST IN THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS.

Being a STEM student from an accredited US university, I'm in favor of the proposed rule for following reasons. \n\n1) Expanding OPT upto 3 years in the new proposed rule not only gives a training benefit to the students but also provides a good number of home grown STEM workers to US employers. These employers will not only benefit from the expertise gained by these students in US universities but also by a student's insight into their respective home/foreign markets and thus benefitting the US employer. \n \n2) I have read and heard a lot of arguments where it is often stated that OPT STEM workers are a source for \"cheap labor\". So far whatever I've seen from my employment experience is not all US employers hire foreign workers its only a handful of them. Those who employ foreign workers like me offer competitive compensation, which of course is decided by education level as well as professional experience. All of my ex employers have offered me the market rate as they would have offered to an American worker. Moreover, I was told they would sponsor H-1B which adds on to their expenses. I can be sure about this as I had the opportunity to be involved in one of my ex employers budgeting session where a budget was set aside for a role irrespective of the nationality of the worker.\n \n3) As a part of Software Industry I have seen how my previous employers have struggled to find STEM workers to backfill positions.

The number of OPTs applied is controlled by the number of international students accepted by accredited universities. It can vary largely based on the economic interests of the universities recruiting. So, the number of OPTs is directly related to the economic interest of universities. DHS should control the number of international students a college can recruit/ control the number of OPTs they can issue.\n\nThe second control that I would like DHS to consider is to control the number of OPTs issued based on economy. If US economy were to go into a recession and STEM employers decide to cut jobs, DHS should stop take steps to prevent employers from hiring OPTs before the people who were let go. DHS should consider adding an automatic stop to issuing OPTs when unemployment in STEM fields goes above 5%, or some level that DHS seems appropriate, is recommended.\n\nWith pro-growth policies that have controls to handle the unexpected, I am confident OPTs can benefit the US economy.\n\n ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3137","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPT extension by 24 months will be extremely helpful to all the international students seeking a lawful work permit after the graduation. \n\nI believe there are thousands of students in the US who will be benefited from this law. \n\nOut of all the problems that an international student faces, this law will definitely reduce one of his/her problem. \n\nHope this goes into effect very soon\n\n-\nSrinivas","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2947","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Srinivas Desai"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I totally agree with the new STEM OPT extension.

As we all know, for High tech companies and Startups, even for many Fortune 500 companies, foreign students are one of the most important resource for labor. Using their proficient skills in science and engineering, foreign students are not only realizing their self- actualization in US, but also helping the US economy grow in a long term.\nI have many foreign friends who play important roles in different industry in US right now, they are smart, hardworking and willing to make contribution for the society. They are irreplaceable parts in the US economy and are role models for the future students.\n\nFor current STEM students and prospective students who plan to apply for STEM degrees, the new proposal will make the US a good choose to working and study. Thats a great news for Universities and research institutions since they will become more attractive to the talent worldwide. With the help of foreign students, they can do their research and develop new technologies in a better way and benefit the whole world.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2033","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yi Zhu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Each STEM student coming into United States spends atleast 30k dollars for education which does not include the living expenses.

In the process, not only is the student gaining good experience which is very difficult to get in their home country, but it also benefits the employers since the student is dedicating his time and intellect to help companies achieve the goal of the company. 12 months of OPT period is not very adequate since in most cases, depending on the nature of the job these 12 months might actually end up in only probationary training, not exactly helping the development of student extensively. I strongly approve this decision of DHS to provide extended OPT period for the STEM students to 24 more months. It will definitely help in the economy of The U.S because all these students will be paying all the legal taxes to boost the economy. It will also help the companies evaluate these students during this period and take legal measures to retain them within the country as there is a dearth of people with these skill sets within the country, Not approving this will create a fundamental demand & supply problem within the tech industry which might severely affect the economy of the company.

This is not the only case.  Additionally, 40% with a H-1B visa have overstayed.  We are undermining our own STEM program.  We are assisting with the illegal immigrant situation and contributing to the low labor participation numbers.  I fail to see the logic.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\n    OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n    OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n\nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\n    The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by David Juszczyk"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Homeland Security:\n\n     As several critics have rightly pointed out, by increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years the Administration has already established a de facto shadow H-1B program.  This move is clearly opposed to the intent of Congress.\n     Moreover, a GAO report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.  The government does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country, and ICE cannot ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status here.\n     OPT should be at most a temporary training program, not a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor instead of American citizens.  We urge the Administration to follow the intent of current laws, and to place the interests of American students first.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobin B.

As far as I know, the reason why most international students choose United States is that it's much easier for them to get industrial experience here, which will make them more competitive compared with peers. With the existence of OPT STEM extension, more and more STEM student would like to pay their tuition to study in United States because they got more opportunities to work here, which is a big plus when they enter job market. \n\nBesides of the tuition income, these international students also created hundreds of thousands of job positions for US. Universities have to hire more faculty and staff to support these students. More cafe, restaurants and shopping center will be open in surrounding areas. More food and vehicles will be purchased, more bus drivers are needed, more text books will be printed. All these activities will create a lot of job positions for United States.\n\nIf the OPT STEM extension is cancelled, the attractiveness of studying in US will be significantly reduced. It's predictable that more and more international student will choose other countries, or not studying aboard at all. American economy will be affected. Native people who already got jobs because of these international students will lose their jobs. This probably will cause an instability of American society.\n\nOne of the reasons why United States has a leading position in Science and Technology is because it's attracting top students all over the world to study in America. After those students graduated, they need an opportunity to use what they have learned to solve real life problems. OPT STEM extension will definitely grant them more opportunities. It obvious that the existence of STEM extension will attract these students to do research in America.\n\nIf the OPT STEM extension is cancelled, it's predictable most of the top international student has to go back to their own country. This will lead to a great talent loss for US.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2470","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yang Yang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It will be really helpful for the students if  the extension is for 24 months","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0965","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sai Kumar"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully support the 24 month STEM OPT extension proposal","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2118","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Manik Vig"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think the STEM extension should be for 36 months instead of 24 months.

Be it the advanced technology and high-production approaches in agriculture that enable a mere 2% of America's population to produce enough food and produce for both domestic consumption and foreign exports, or the advanced technologies developed during the Space Competition around the \"Cold War\" era and later trickled down to every aspects of our society including Satellite communication, personal computers, and the whole Internet,  or the advances in medicine, clinical and surgical technologies that give birth to new life-saving ways and medicine, \nthese world-leading technology advances have tremendous and profound impacts on every aspect of our society, and an edge in Science and Technology makes America the most powerful country in the world. \nKeeping this edge in advanced science and technology is determinant for the future of US, and the \"people\" resource is a critical (and arguably most important) part in developing and bringing about these advances. Students trained in programs with STEM degrees will become the future engineers and architects in these scientific fields, yet due to limits in current immigration laws and policies, some non-immigrant students don't obtain sufficient time to find a fitting position beyond their degrees where they can deploy their skills and talents, and are forced to leave the country before they can contribute to it. Such are great losses to America, and these losses will be detrimental to the country in the long run since these lost talents to America become contributors to other countries. \nAn extension to the Optional Practical Training program will help in retaining these talents by allowing extra time and opportunities to students in STEM to find fitting positions where they get to use what they learn. An improvement in OPT program policy will invariably benefit America as a whole in many profound ways beyond the immediate impacts.\nAs such, I wholeheartedly support the improvement and extension of the Optional Practical Training programs and hope US will always keep its edge in science and technology and remain the greatest country in the world.

I.E Disney World.\n\nThe proposals are presented as humanitarian, yet buckles to corporate interests over the needs of seniors who paid into a system all of their lives.

Oh please, do you really belief this malarkey for a moment? Sounds like a bad used car salesperson. \n\nMany immigrant students on work visas overstay. Some apply for citizenship or just blend in without paying into the system. However, they use our social services and medical systems that they never paid for. Great deal for them.

However, U.S. citizens cannot satisfy the need of the industries. If international students from STEM can have an extension of OPT period, it certainly relieve the work force shortage pressure on many companies. Secondly, with the extension of OPT time period, it will promote the competition among U.S. citizens and international students, which will largely enhance the skills and the efforts from both sides. It certainly will help U.S. to keep competitive in highly qualified job candidates throughout the country. Thirdly, STEM extension will improve the relationship and the cultural communication between U.S. and other countries. In other word, diversified employees will bring out more understanding of different cultures and respect each other, which is significantly important in the globalizaion. In conclusion, the extension of OPT brings out a great amount of benefits to U.S. citizens, companies and government.

The employment of these outstanding foreign students benefits them from gaining valuable and practical STEM work experience. More importantly, it will benefit the U.S. from utilizing these students STEM skills to maintain Americas global competitiveness in the areas of science, technology, engineering and math. With a lead in such areas, America will maintain its leading position in economy across a variety of industries in the world, which in turn will benefit the U.S. citizens overall. \n\nWith the increasing development in the areas of STEM in their countries of origin, many outstanding foreign students may choose to return to their own countries after completing their studies in the U.S.; America will thus lose a large number of talents who would have contributed the U.S. economy and technology development if they had chosen to stay. The proposed STEM OPT extension undoubtedly will reduce the chance of losing these exceptional students and attract more qualified foreign students to seek employment in the U.S., by offering more time of temporary employment upon graduation and additional lottery chances in obtaining H1B visas.

It will benefit not only international students but also many U.S. employers and the entire U.S. economy. I am an international student with F1-visa, just graduated from Stanford with my master degree in Electrical Engineering. Now I am working at a startup company as a software engineer in San Francisco with my OPT. Honestly, I was really worried when I saw the news that the original 17-month opt extension was revoked this August. Lots of my friends were also very upset. We are foreign students came from different countries. We came to U.S. to pursue BS/MS/PhD degree for better education here. But if opt extension is revoked, so many young and talented students have to go back to their original countries, say goodbye to the career they just started, which is very unreasonable, also a bad news for those U.S. employers, such as those tech companies. They would also lose great employees, which is the most resource for a company. But now, if we can make this good news - the new proposed rule valid, it will bring so many benefits, which is really really exciting. At least for myself, if this rule is confirmed eventually, I would have 3 times to attend the H1B visa lottery; I won't need to worry about my visa anymore, I can finally focus on my work and life with relief.\n\nAlso, this proposal will definitely improve the integrity of the STEM OPT program by encouraging we students to gain valuable, practical STEM experience, while preventing adverse effects to U.S. workers. By enhancing our functional understanding of how to apply academic knowledge in a work setting, we will be better qualified to embark on careers in their respective fields of study. These on-the-job experiences would be obtainable only with employers committed to developing students knowledge and skills through practical application. Moreover, the proposed rules aim to maintain the competitive edge in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States, which is so important to the U.S.\n\nIn summary, I totally support this proposal and hope it could be valid as soon as possible.

You have more American families on government assistance than ever in our history;  we must get financially responsible, and make the changes necessary to rectify this fact before we help anyone else or continue the debt spiral track we are on currently.  If we cannot get our debt under control, we cannot help anyone else in the world.  Please stop and think for a minute about what American citizens need first so we can be in a position to help others.    \n\nThe FOIA request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two disgusting facts about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand;  1.  you are denying unemployed  American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 while telling us everything is great, I can assure you it is not;  we have the lowest labor participation rate in 30 years, Americans don't work we can help no one else help themselves.  And, 2. the program removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds when everyone is now aware both programs are a financial disaster for our country and the programs were a big cost lie when they were started, just like ACA.  We simply cannot afford to help everyone in the world without Americans getting back to work.    \n\nI believe your hearts are in the right place, but the timing is not good for our country;  I believe delaying and suspending all non-critical programs should be the rule.  Until we have our debts paid and our unfunded liabilities fully funded with a balanced budget, suspending this program is in the best interest of our country, so we will be in a position again in the future to help more people from other countries. \n\nThank you so much for the opportunity to voice my opposition. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3783","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Kim Graham"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am completely with the OPT STEM extension.\n\nThere are two types of foreign students doing STEM in USA, funded and non funded.\n\nFor the funded students, U.S. university or government money funds them, trains them, develops them in this country, their skills, knowledge and thinking process. Losing them due to improper working laws thereafter is a complete waste of resource for this very country.\n\nFor non funded students, many of them take education loan and make investments in USA education system. If these students are forced to leave country soon after completion, they will never make investments in U.S. education system as they will not be able to recover their loans, in the first place. Thus the education system will lose a very big revenue stream.\n\nThis is about the monetary sides of thing. Now about the training they get. The STEM foreign students are among the best analytical minds who are necessary to do the high skilled technical and analytical works required in the jobs of these types. If the U.S. employers do not get these talents, their competitors in other regions will get them and can lose out in competition though the talent has been developed in U.S.\n\nIf there was ample supply of these well trained skilled workers locally in abundance, these policy of extension was not required in first place. Since the lack and the demand was observed this policy came in the first place. Thus effectively, it was not hampering or taking away the jobs of the locals, rather fulfilling a gap which could not be fulfilled only with the talents available locally.\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Pap Na"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think 36 month is better than 24 month.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0626","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Brian Wei"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is a very welcome move by DHS to reinstate the STEM OPT extension rule and further revise it for 24 months.

While most companies which hire international students are e-verified, it is not the case with the US Universities.\n\nMost of the universities are exempt from the verification requirement and they do this process only for federal contracts. This severely impacts the chance of students to work as a researcher (after M.S. or a Ph.D.). I am a Ph.D. from US university and working as a post doc researcher at NYU. However, I can not apply for extension as the university is not e-verified.

The opportunities are marvellous for each foreign  student that we learn lot of work , exposure to different people and work atmosphere. The growth and knowledge technology wise is so good that most of the other countries dont provide. I think both ways foreign students earn a lot by this when they work as well us earns a lot of revenue inviting lakhs to students all over the world. Cancelling the extension or any such thing would just simply be loss of revenue for the country which is a lot and miss out the growth of both the other countries as well as US.

At a time when so many American born citizens are spending vast sums to get the kind of training that would give them the knowledge and skills to qualify for so-called \"STEM\" jobs this action is unthinkable. My reasons for writing to urge you not to take this action are as follows:\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nI hope that you will consider the needs of qualified STEM workers and students in STEM disciplines over the needs of employers to save money an have a large pool of foreign born cheap labor.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3451","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Joe Glaston"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"General Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap.

The majority of them have already obtained a job and played an important role in the world-class companies, and these companies are making profits though the talent, professionalism and expertise from these students. The current OPT is only valid for 12 months which means they only have one opportunity to win the H1b lottery, and the chance of winning is becoming lower and lower in the past couple of years. Without extending their training opportunities, they have no choice but going back to their own country. This would be a huge loss to the United States.\n\nSeven years ago when I chose my graduate school, my advisor strongly recommended me coming to the United States because it is the research center of my major. In this place I can meet the best people, enjoy the best training and expose to the most cutting-edge research topics. I think this kind of story does not incidentally happen to me but apply to people in many other field as well, and that is why the United States are the No.1 choice for many international students all along the time. In retrospective, the contributions from these excellent students are making US even stronger.

Traditionally, America is referred as a \"melting pot,\" and welcomes people from lots of different countries, races, and religions, all hoping to find freedom, new opportunities, and a better way of life.  It is this CHERISHED VALUE that attracts the most talented people all over the world to come to US and then contribute to the development of the science, culture and economy, making the US better and better.  For example, a considerable amount of the Nobel laureates in US are first-generation immigrants.  However, the prior OPT STEM extension cancellation pushes over ten thousands of people to leave US all of sudden.  If this occurred, this event would release a signal that US is not welcoming immigrants anymore, extremely violating its traditional value and also extremely discouraging talented people further come to US world-widely. \n\nSecondly, a majority of the students using OPT STEM extension hold a doctoral degree.  They actively work in colleges and companies to seek experiences that they could not obtain during their earlier studies, during which they apply their prior knowledge to some new research areas so as to advance the science and technology.  This process usually combines with the emergence of new ideas, collaborations and patents, novel products, and new entrepreneurs chances, which will eventually create more job opportunities in future.  This highly benefits the economy of the US.  Additionally, during the OPT period, students may find the weakness of their knowledge.  Then, they can contact their prior colleges so as to let them improve their quality of US education in future. \n\nThirdly, students using OPT STEM extension come from a variety of countries, each with their own special culture.  Having them together here helps US understand and learn the diversity of culture in the world.  For example, thanks to the immigrants with different backgrounds in the Bay Area, we now can easily enjoy different types food, music, art and literature.  \n\nBesides, at least I dont see the point of simply sending students in STEM areas back to their own countries immediately after their graduation.  Instead of letting them use their obtained knowledge to contribute the science and economy of US for a couple of years after their graduation, sending these talented doctoral students back to build their own countries stronger will significantly hurt US competitiveness in future. \n\nOccasionally, I heard from some people that they worry that these talented foreign students will steal job opportunities, making them more difficult to find a job.  However, the best solution to improve unemployment rate is to create more job opportunities rather than everyone brutally fighting for one job all the time.  Look at how many new companies and new job opportunities has been created by foreign students every year, then you can easily see if these talented students really steal your job or actually create a job for you!\n\nIn summary, I highly welcome this new policy, and I believe this policy will continuously attract the most talented people all over the world to build a stronger and better US with advanced science and technology, various culture, and dynamic economy. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3131","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Wenju Bai, Stanford University"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We need this rule as it is very beneficial for people with STEM course.

On the other hand, more importantly for the US government and the whole community, if the OPT extension was canceled, huge amount of international students working with OPT would have to go back to their home country immediately, which would lead to a huge expense of the US companies who hired them to look for new candidates. As we all know, a lot of high-tech companies hire a lot of international students. If OPT extension was canceled, these companies would have to take large loss in the following year due to the rehiring, which would also be a bad news for the US economy. So I think it is a win-win for both the US government and international students working with OPT to approve the 24-month extension.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2221","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Lijun Yu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, in a letter to President Obama, stated:\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThe proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it. The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\n\nOPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers. Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? \n\nThere is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates. U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000. DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly. If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\n\nNot only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. A 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\n\nThe worker protections included in the new rule \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.They do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, they chase Americans out of computer science and they create a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\nTo summarize, this proposed rule is so ill-advised that it needs to be totally scrapped. We need programs for putting Americans to work, not programs like this that give American jobs to cheap foreign labor.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3829","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Fred Stevens"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am engineer and alumnus from MIT and I see the outcome of poor immigration policy all the time.

I see a few things this new rule will have a positive impact to United States' economy, diversity and technology industries.\n\nKeeping OPT extension means that we will not lose lots of talents who graduated from one of our top US universities. These students have already proved that they can quickly find a job in high-tech company and performed an excellent job on their work. These students have brought lots of revenues to the companies. And since these students work in high-tech companies, they also pay more taxes. On the reverse hand, if we don't keep the OPT extension, we would loose these revenues and also it might be a very bad impact for US reputation on international education. There will be less student will apply for US colleges because of this.\n\nThis leads to keeping diversity in US colleges. Currently, we have students from all over the world and this help the country to develop diversity. And I would like to see it continue to be this way.\n\nIf we lose these talented students, technology companies will not be happy about it. They hire thousands of international students every year. And these students are the driver for next generation technologies. Not keeping OPT extension would block our US technology advance.\n\nIn general, this new rule would help US in many aspects.

We pay for you to have your jobs and you should be serving us not foreigners.  It is imperative for our citizens that foreign workers and immigration are only permitted in reasonable amounts.  What we are being forced to withstand is NOT within reason.   \n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nAs senator Grassley has stated in a letter to president Obama: \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs (Optical Practical Training) are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nFrom Professor Norm Matloff,an American professor of computer science at the University of California, Davis:\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3229","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sherri Bartolucci"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is really important for international students to have a long time period to practice their knowledge soon after their graduation.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1072","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jiehao Chen"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002.\nIt does not seem prudent for our educational system, national debt, fellow American students and potential employment, national safety, current immigration crisis, Medicare crisis, or any other of the scores of problems in our country for this regulation to extend its limit.

STEM graduates will fill in work force. \n\nForeign students occupy half of all U.S. graduate enrollments in \nengineering, math, and computer science,etc.. There still are not enough U.S. \nstudents graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly \nspecialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an \nadvanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field \ncreates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers because they help lead \nin innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT\nSTEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main source for foreign-born \nindividuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field.\nHowever, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 60,000 visa numbers for \nindividuals who have earned a Bachelor degree and above, at a U.S. \nuniversity. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and\nbrightest by random lottery, not by merit.\n\nSkilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help \ncreate new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, \nforeign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields \nfrom U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment \nopportunities of native-born workers.\n\nI urge you to support the U.S. economy by extending the \nperiod of OPT by 24 months for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees.And please consider extend gap periods to give F-1 non-immigrant students another chance to join in lottery.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0492","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jame Yang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It would be very helpful if the extension is beyond 17 months for all the STEM students.

STEM caught on, students rose to the occasion, parents and the broader community saw the value of the endeavor--that is until reports filtered back that recent;y graduating students couldn't get jobs using their STEM educations. That takes the incentive out of any project when a community invested in STEM learns that there are no, or not that many, jobs in STEM for all the students we are training and setting on that course.\n\nAs an educator with 50+ years experience at retirement, I see the STEM education initiative in K-12 schools, technical school and community colleges has gone the way of other initiatives I've watched and been apart of for the past five decades as an educator: first there's the hype, then the buy-in (coerced or otherwise), then the glut of students trained and pointed in that initiatives direction, then the market flooding, and finally the let down when graduating students can't find jobs in which to use that training. \n\nWhen we seek to prioritize a training, nationally, then we should support the job market, nationally, for those American students we've trained. Not to do so demoralizes, at the least, those whose focus has been turned to prepare themselves for that opportunity--including all stakeholders: students, teachers, parents, and often the wider community--who equally give themselves to the initiative's promise and potential.\n\nAs I see it, and historically, it has been a priority to educate American students for American jobs first and foremost. Please do not think here that I am pass in not recognizing the encroaching globalism, I  see it--but I think it should unfold organically, not by neglecting the people of this country and their needs in lieu of forcing its evolution: America's first responsibility should be to provide for its own citizens--and I think we have not done that by a long shot! That said, to my mind, this \"Proposed Rule\"would be an example of disregarding that foremost responsibility: Once our own citizens have their education and career needs met, as in preparing and obtaining jobs using their fanfare induced STEM training. Then and only then, if our largess is such that we can afford to extend services to students of other countries who come here for our superior education, who then opt to linger to take advantage of extended time to use that education in our marketplace, that could be an option, but only after our marketplace is saturated with American workers trained for those positions. \n\nThe example of companies such as Disney, although using a different government rule, to replace American worker's with foreign workers is just a prelude to what your Proposed Rule will do. It is at this point in time a further demoralization, destruction, and I make bold to add, demonization, of the American worker in the American workplace.

As a OPT student, one will be able to work longer in the US and get better prepared for his/her career in his/her own country. Many students who plan to work in US for 2 or 3 years do not need to rely on H1B visa if they are able to work in OPT status for 3 years, and this will largely relieve the H1B visa tension. Since most of the students want to gain work experience and go back to their own country after 2 or 3 years, holding an H1B visa will be a waste because they will not use up the years. Thus, extending OPT rather than offering H1B is a better way to provide a legal work status for these students.\n\nSecond, the fast growing of IT industry is short of STEM talents, and will definitely be demanding more, especially talent new grads. OPT students have contributed a lot to the success of big IT companies, like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc, and these companies make a better life for us. Talents are the heart of these companies and the heart of future innovation, where US, as the world IT industry leader, definitely wants to play a big role. Extending OPT program will keep more talented and skilled foreign students working and contributing in US and secure the economic growth. \n\nThird, keeping OPT students will help create more job opportunities and improve the US job market. Some people argue that these students will take their jobs in the future, but this is not true. Actually, these OPT students will help expand the industry and thus creating more jobs. Look at those startups, a lot of them are created by foreign talented students or have these students working hard during their growth. Some of the startups will grow to giants and create tons of positions. This is very beneficial to US job market in the long term.

It not only makes the graduates available to the local companies and let them transfer their knowledge skills on to the practices followed in industry but also help the American institutions build a rich working alumni and thus facilitate research partnerships with their companies and job opportunities for the future graduates. I believe it's only beneficial that the graduates work for the local companies in their early career when they're more innovative, ready to take risks and the direct consequence of this will be better industry practices leading to new inventions and more start ups on the block, thus pushing the economy of America forward. Also during the early years of their career the graduates would form a strong alumni base and being in the same country as their alma mater they would feel a sense of belonging and thus the connection between them and the institutions would remain strong.

I would not have to worry about my future before going into the third year, which would to a great extent help me maintain high productivity and a peaceful mindset at work. My employers would be more willing to assign me longer and more important projects because they would know for sure I could stay in the company for at least three years. \n\nIf the 65,000 H-1B quota did not change in the next few years, extending STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months would literally give me one more chance to draw the \"lottery\". It would also give me an extra year to make plans for the future, such as preparing for graduate school application, in case I missed the first two draws.  \n\nThe third party of interest is the prospective foreign students who are looking forward to coming to the U.S. to study. Longer STEM OPT extension would be able to attract more students to study STEM subjects. Personally, the main reason I chose a STEM major over a non-STEM major four years ago was because I could have a longer OPT with a STEM degree. Without that incentive, the students who have to make the same decision would likely choose non-STEM majors unless they have strong interests in those intrinsically more difficult subjects. Consequently, the technology industries are likely to be short of highly-skilled foreign students in the future.   \n\nIn summary, this new rule is a well-thought move by DHS. It would benefit both STEM students and their employers, and the biggest beneficiary at the end would of course be the US economy. \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2669","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Di Sheng"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a PhD in science close to graduation and I need the OPT extension.

To the international students, most of the time, the precious working experience is more important than a green card. Most of the international students in United States are from developing countries, like China and India. In these developing countries, they need these international students with a broader view and latest technologies more than United States. But due to the increase of international student population, most of the high salary jobs in these countries are only opened to internationaI students with enough working experience and the staring salary in these countries is not comparable to developed countries like United States. This is the reason why lots of new graduated international students want to find jobs in United States and stay here until they can get a working visa. However, if they can have a total 3 year working experience in United States, I think most of the international students would love to come back to their home country after this period instead of get a green card and stay here forever and the job openings will not be occupied by international students in a long term. And this will encourage more and more international students to come and study in United States and bring huge profits in this way. These international students need to pay relatively higher tuition fee and other fee for school, this income can increase funding for the US universities and colleges to improve the teaching equipment, support research and increase the faculty salaries. Moreover, international students need to live their own lives beside study. This also a huge expense will promote a lot of service industries. For instance, there are Home-Stay towns in California, from where domestic families providing a home stay for the young age international students and make money in this way. And this could be the main household income for these families.  Also, international student who worked for United States after they graduated with a short term employment will not affect their long term employment to the citizen. As more and more companies can hire short term international student for their short term projects and make profits really quick. These companies dont need to provide Visa sponsorship for international student as they have enough time to work legally to finish a project. In this way, these companies can have more jobs only open to citizens. An extended OPT will change the current situation as the international students are occupying a lot of long-term job openings for citizen. \nIn a word, I support the extension of OPT period for STEM international students as this will bring profits to both sides.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0703","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Weiyue Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"     Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand: 1.OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and 2.OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n     By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n     The proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\" \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT.

International students majoring in STEM have huge potential in contributing to the economy. The OPT STEM is a perfect program to realize it. \n\nEconomists have reported time and again the benefits these highly skilled individuals bring to the native population. They are more likely to start a business and generate jobs, they work in high tech industries that are at the forefront of innovations. In short, they help in keeping the US economy at the front. These students bring business to the economy in terms of tuition and living expenditure to the universities and municipals. At times when college enrollment for native population is at an all time low, these students fill in the void and make sure that these institutions of higher learning are afloat.\n\nI fully support the expansion of the STEM OPT program from the current 29 to 36 months. As the DHS mentioned in its draft rule, it should provide guidance if at all the rule making process is not completed before February 12th, 2016.  \n \nThe executive action is indeed a temporary measure to solve the impact of our broken immigration system.

On the other hand, high technology companies will probably not considering international students when they're recruiting. From my own perspective, a 24 month extension will definitely be a huge attraction for me to decide staying in the states and working for a couple of years but not going back to my home country as soon as I graduate. I believe this amendment proposal will bring good outcomes for both the US high tech industry and economies as well as give F1 STEM students a better reason to continue working.

In turn, the national production those international new grads create has non-negligible importance to the industry, citizens' life and national prosperity. STEM grads who needs to take advantage of the OPT extension usually make up the foundation of those technical companies will regretlessly and diligently fix those concrete and detailed jobs. They are analogous to small screws of the huge machine. Without the existence of those screws, the machine will fall apart. To illustrate this statement, let see some examples in IT industry. Nowadays, large portion of IT grads are Indians and Chinese and they are responsible for the core part of many companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. It's not an uncommon scenario that they often work overtime to maintain the servers, databases and design and implement functionality of existed software or service. Some can argue that first tier talented people can stay in US by EB1 visa. But one cannot deny the production competence of a country or the prosperity of the country largely depends on the strong middle class and those STEM grads are quite qualified for the middle class category. Not only OPT extension benefits both party of STEM grads and the states, but only those decently paid grads contribute a significant amount of income salary. The immediate benefit resulted from OPT extension increases government revenue and raise the funding for the government to do more charitable executions. All in all, OPE extension is mutual beneficial and there is no strong reasons that lead the states to deny such proposal.

OPT Extension (24-month) along with 12-month OPT will help international STEM students significantly because all academic, private or public organizations/companies require both academic knowledge and practical experience. OPT extension will help to grow American economy as well.\n\nI would like to describe my personal circumstance. I have completed my first Master's in Agricultural Engineering from a U.S. research university. In that degree, I took few GIS (Geographic Information System) courses to implement GIS knowledge in Agricultural Engineering. Then I have completed my second Master's in Geography at the same university and worked in a NASA funded project as a graduate research assistant. Later, I recognized GIS major is defined as STEM (CIP code 45.0702 (Geographic Information Science and Cartography)) but Geography is not (CIP code 45.0701 (Geography)). However, most of the graduate level coursework and research of GIS (Geographic Information System) in the U.S. universities are offered in Geography departments. Additionally, offering PhD in GIS (CIP code 45.0702) is very rare in U.S. universities. Therefore, geography should be included as a STEM major.\n\nNow, I am in OPT and gaining experience in GIS related area and would like to acquire 3 years (12 months OPT + 24 months OPT extension) practical experience and then I would like to go for my PhD in geography and would like to acquire practical experience again. Therefore, STEM OPT extension is crucial for me. If geography is not included as STEM, international students like me need to go another country for PhD in geography where we can complete PhD and achieve practical experience (e.g., 36 months) in this field. I also published a paper in a peer reviewed journal why geography should be included as STEM (doi:10.5539/jgg.v7n1p27): http://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jgg/article/view/43858/24468. I urge DHS to include geography (CIP code 45.0701) in STEM list so that we can pursue our PhD in geography from a U.S. university. Please feel free to contact with me if you need additional information.\n\nAlso, please make \"exit and re-entry\" easy for international students in OPT period. Initial OPT was 12 months and travelling outside of U.S. was no urgent issue for that period. However, now students need to travel home and come back in 36-month period (OPT 12 month and STEM extension 24 month). Therefore, please make visa available and quickly in OPT period.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2427","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Md Rajibul Al Mamun"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Opt extension will largely reduce the impact of H1b lottery miss.

This change has contributed significantly to the erosion of our previous leadership in science and technology.  Our STEM-focused federal agencies and universities are now overrun with individuals from foreign countries.  This fact has further reduced the number of U.S. citizens that want to pursue STEM careers.  For some unwarranted reason, we have decided that foreign students are better prospects for STEM careers than citizen students. Rather than spending resources on improving the preparation of our citizens for STEM careers, we have opted to simply import STEM people rather than to grow and nurture our own.  Whereas importing STEM talent might be a cost-efficient, short-term approach, I submit that such an approach has a number of negative long-term consequences for the U.S.  So, let's quit taking the easy path of importing STEM and instead, focus once again on producing STEM people from our talented citizens!  \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3461","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sherry Farwell"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully support the proposed rule.\nIt is beneficial to not only the students but also to the US economy.\nUS is known for its diversity.

Many of them would not choose to study in the USA if the OPT can only last for 12 months. 800,000 people is not a big number for our job market, but the tuition income of 800,000 students is absolutely a huge amount of income for education.\n\nAlso, advanced talents is one of the decisive factor for economic development. And obviously STEM students who are or will be using the OPT are typical advanced talents. Although their disadvantages in network and non-US citizenship, they can still get a job related to their major, which proves their outstanding skills.

The H-1B program abuses by some corporations is appalling, and now we are going to consider doing the stem workers another wrong through the OPT program. We MUST help get our own American citizen workers back to stable jobs to support both the worker and our country. Here are a few things I would want to here an answer to.\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. From Senator Grassley, \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\" From John Miano, \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\" From Norm Matloff of UC Davis, \"On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\" \"If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\" \"If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\" \"OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\" From Richard Trumpka, President ALF-CIO, \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\" From David North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department, \"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\", \"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\" From Ron Hira of Howard University, \"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.\" From Ian Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, \"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\" \"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\" \nOur schools are pushing science and math like never before, but we are eliminating those jobs our own children would be able to get. This makes no sense to me, other than to line the pockets of corporations. We do not \"need\" more stem workers from other countries, but NEED to support our own citizen workers. The H-1B program has already been abused, don't let this happen again!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3817","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Robert Lee"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think this rule is critical for America to keep attracting the smartest people in the world and ensure that Americas tech firms own the talents of international students, it should be supported.\nFirstly, the STEM extension is a critical advantage in attracting top students from all over the world to study in U.S. Universities.\n\nAs an engineering student from a small town in India, Ishwar Meyyappan dreamed about helping his country develop its solar power capacity and in a more energy-efficient way. Studying for a graduate degree from Columbia University, Meyyappan is closer than ever to achieving his goal. In the past year and a half, hes studied how solar power works as well as the policy and business of the industry. After he graduates in December, Meyyappan plans to work at a U.S. solar panel company for a couple of years. India is five years behind the U.S. in solar technology, he said. I want to work in a solar company here and apply the the experience Ive gained back home. The chance to get that work experience was the whole point of coming here. he said. His plans are now at risk because the STEM extension is now in jeopardy. \n\nThe Federal Courts decision to vacate STEM OPT Extension Rule on August 12, 2015 is leaving students like Meyyappan feeling betrayed. When we came in, we made a calculation about how much its going to cost us, and how much were going to earn, he said. I could have gone to London, I could have gone to Australia, but I chose the U.S.\n\nSome students whove gone home after being unable to secure a work visa say they were disappointed that they werent allowed to stay. Masher Dillon, who graduated with an undergraduate degree from UC-Berkeley last year, is now working a marketing job back home in India.\n\nHe was the first of his friends and immediate family to go to college in the U.S., and going to Berkeley was his first time being in the country. A lot of people back home think that working in the United States is like, oh shit, youre arrived, he said. If you work there, regardless of what you do, you could be an Uber driver and it still seems so prestigious.\n\nHe worked in the Bay Area after graduating, but once he ran out of OPT and didnt win the H-1B lottery, he went home. Dhillon doesnt mind working and living at home, and hes saving money, but he says if he was applying for college today, he wouldnt choose an American university. You American students take your job opportunities for granted, he said. I tell my friends, appreciate it for all its worth.\n\nAlso, U.S. companies especially tech firms say they need the talents of international students. Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language-learning app Duelingo and a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, said the limits on hiring international students were frustrating for employers like him.\n\nYou hire a person, who is extremely well educated, and you get them to come work for you, and you have a 70% chance that theyre not going to be able to stay, von Ahn said, Its terrible, because even if you hire super smart people, it takes a couple months to train them. They dont start becoming very useful to the company until about six months  and then they have to leave.\n\nIf the STEM extension isnt reinstated, he said, were probably going to lose two employees who are really hard to hire, a big problem for a small company like Duelingo with only 50 employees. All these extremely well-educated people are probably going to go to some other country and make that country better.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0072","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Zhou Liu, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like our government to protect the American people for once.

Either increase the H1-B quota limit or provide these students more time in the US so they can achieve their dreams.\nYou always hear this statement now a days that \"students in countries like India and China are honing their Math, Science and English skills are getting more competitive\". What makes them better at this? It is the primary and high school teachers in those countries. Bring those teachers to the US. They will work harder to impart those skills to the children in the US. All this is possible by an open and a better immigration policy.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0846","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Amar Zavery, Microsoft Corporation"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support this .\nIt's great opportunity for international students.\nTalented human power to organizations in us.\nIt would be more helpful if stem extension increase to 36 months or more......","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2102","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Pothuraju C."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a STEM majored graduate who is working in an IT company now.

My husband is a STEM worker and his wages were severely cut as a graduate  with 2 degrees Univ of // Engineering School and Computer Science.\n\n. My Husband retired, forced to retire early because of foreign workers taking the open engineering jobs or working for less pay.\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\nBackground of spouse to show he is accomplished engineer:   \n\nEarly career he worked on optical scanner . The devbeloment hardware and software enabled to read sender's  writing on envelopes and tell the sort machine what to do.\nNot too much problem early in his career with foreign workers.\nProblems came later in his career.\n\nOne of his last engineering jobs was a solo effort. He made millions of dollars for the company.  He developed software used in telecommunications.\n\nI might add with pride that he met many American engineers who are as capable as he.  He met the inventor of a certain phone technology.  Inventor is A normal American guy working out of a smaller company in a smaller city.  Company gained huge profits from invention, not the engineer.  \n\nSpouse lost out of many jobs to foreign workers.  And settled for less money. He retired early because of foreigners.  I surmise you probably think something is wrong socially or emotionally with American Engineers to let their jobs be taken over by foreigners.  Not my husband. He is bright  conversationalist.  Anyways I enjoy engineering types.  fascinating, loving people.  \n\nI want to add foreign tech workers aren't able to grasp the finished concept of projects as American Engineers do.   foreigners needed lots of help on projects from American Engineers.  Some foreigners couldn't meet deadlines, and when asked questions about deadlines or get fired they would magically appear with the software code in a few days time>  The software code the foreign workers couldn't explain how it worked.  Conclusion is  the foreign workers got help at nite or farm the needed code out to more capable engineer and claim it as their own the next morning.\n\nAs I said in the beginning I am the wife of an American Degreed Engineer. His college B+ GPA Grade Point Average from BIg 10 school was B from engineering school.  I, myself, viewed the engineering occupation thru my job.  16 employed years at Univ library Science and Engineering.  I met foreign EE and Computer Science students.  The atendees I met during teaching Seminars affirmed my belief American Engineer can do the job better and faster than foreigners who can't grasp the finished concept project.   \n\nMany American engineers we had as friends decided they would have been better off financially working in different occupations  as school teachers because of engineer's low pay and frequent layoffs.\n\n  Because American engineers' jobs became temporary jobs labeled as project engineers.  Some American engineers leave profession to become lawyers, union manual jobs and teachers.   Please believe there is no shortage of engineers, only low paid shortage.  Look at new  Engineering graduates, where's the jobs???  Where are these working.   Instead of American workers at job site you might walk down the halls of engineering firms and see cubicles are filled with foreign workers because of high incentives to employers paid by the government. low wages to employee and lots of help from American Engineer. Low wages and frequent layoffs for American Engineer is what the foregn worker brings us. I surmise a decent wage for engineer would be $100,00 year but sadly it is temporary job with a mid level might make $55,000 a year and employed on project for 2 years then on unemployment and no work for a few years.

I especially laud the proposal to extend the duration of the current STEM extension, which, in combination with the 12-month OPT, is in step with a typical grant cycle on which a majority of science OPT employees are hired. \n\nThe transition period from degree to permanent employment is precarious Because of the current shorter STEM extension periods, many STEM employees are forced to switch to different visa classes (commonly J- or H1 visas) in order to continue pursuing training in their relevant fields, especially in biomedical research. An extended OPT period would provide both the STEM candidates as well as their employers reasonable time to ponder employment options once the training period is over. \n\nMoreover, often enough (and once again, more frequently observed in biomedical sciences), STEM graduates opt to take up training under a second (and less commonly, third) mentor in order to broaden their scope of training, or simply due to incompatibilities with the primary mentor (an example of this is postdoctoral training, and this has been extensively covered by leading science journals http://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-the-postdoc-1.17253) Under these circumstances, trainees would \"use up\" crucial months of the STEM employment period without many productive gains. \n\nKeeping in mind the foregoing circumstances, I recommend adding an option to further extend the STEM extension period to 36 months (instead of the proposed 24 months).","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0905","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sri Vijayraghavan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believed that more engineers, more scientists and more researchers will do USA real good.

US being one of the world's leader in research and development, the students get an firsthand experience on the emerging technology. The section 'Benefits of International Students in the United States' clearly states that international students have directly contributed to the economy of US via tuition and their contribution to the emerging technologies. The 24 month STEM extension proposal in place for the vacated 17 month extension would encourage more international students coming into the country for better education thus contributing directly to the economy. \n\nThe Mentoring and Training Plan outlined will definitely clear any doubts that people had in the 17 month extension. Through this new plan students get trained in the field of their STEM degree and also help the employer in drafting a plan that can effectively utilize their potential. I hope all doubters of the 17 month extension welcome this idea as the employer would clearly define the nature of job and the impact a STEM graduate's skill can make to the company's growth and the US economy.\n\nAlso I agree with the statement that the projects STEM students are involved in their workplace are generally long and goes for more than 2 years. These projects impact a company's goals and losing a STEM graduate working on a critical project can hurt the company. I work in a technology environment and I have seen projects go on for a long period of time as it involves many stakeholders with different ideas and perspectives. With the proposed Mentoring plan the employers will outline their expectation from the STEM graduates on these projects for a period of 24 months or more.\n\nI believe those who are currently in the 17 month extension program should also benefit from the 24 month proposed extension by requesting the additional 7 month OPT period. Since these students have proven themselves in the work environment with their potential during their approved 17 month extension they should get a waiver from the proposed Mentoring and Training Plan if it becomes part of the final rule.\n\nAs stated in the section 'Safeguarding U.S. Workers Through Measures Consistent With Labor Market Protections' and being  STEM graduate who had benefited from the vacated 17 month extension I believe that US citizens and STEM graduates are treated equally by employers with job responsibilities, compensation and benefits. From my experience and those around me I have not come across a STEM graduate being employed in place of a US citizen for accepting less compensation.\n\nI firmly support the proposals towards the STEM graduate program and the contribution these graduates can make towards the economy of the United States. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0778","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Vignesh Swaminathan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support this rule of 24 months STEM OPT because it helps students to benefit from gaining knowledge and also allows employers to employ foreign students as they can stay for a long time with them.

It also helps it improve competitiveness vis--vis other developed nations. US has to compete today with new and faster growing economies like China and India. The following points support the above hypotheses\n\n1. US educated international students have undergone an education system that is continually tuned and updated for the innovative needs of US Industries. By letting them go out of the country, they carry the learning with them and benefit their country of origin than the USA. \n2. Supply of STEM graduates in US cannot cope up with demand leading to companies directly hiring from overseas undergrad colleges, putting US graduates and undergraduates at a disadvantage and increasing costs (companies have to incur higher costs to recruit from overseas)to the nation.\n3. The OPT extension opportunity will encourage more students to study in the USA (vis--vis other countries) thus supporting the US economy further.\n4. Balancing supply of STEM skilled workforce with demand helps keep the labor rates competitive for the industry and keeps costs and inflation down.\n5. By increasing OPT duration, the nation will be able to reduce dependence on H1B, as companies will have the option to assess competencies of the US educated graduates during the OPT period and give them the first shot at an H1B, before looking for overseas candidates. This gives the nation to seek a good balance between OPT and H1B programs.\n6. Education in the US not only increases their skills, but also improves their skills in sports, soft skills, confidence and managerial capabilities; which are not usually an area of focus for international colleges. Thus parting by with a US educated undergraduate student the nation loses more than just their technical competence.\n\nIn short, extending the OPT program will make the US a preferred destination for higher education, give opportunities to companies to recruit locally and the retain the best of the best (through H1B) which eventually is a best solution in the long term.

By following these policies on consistent basis USA has become so great that is unbeatable by any other nation. In order to remain so, it has to consistently follow these same doctrines.\n\n,It is the people of the nation who are the greatest of all the resources and all other resources get created by these very people. USA has proved this to the world by utilizing best of the people resources all over the world effectively and efficiently. USA has attracted the best talent in the world because of its open policies and most of the intelligent, innovative and hardworking   people  in the world prefer to work in USA . It is because of this reason that no other country in the world has built up such a strong foundation and remained in No. 1 position consistently for so long. This definitely benefits all US citizens not only in the long run but also in the short run if one thinks open mindedly.\n\nUSA   has always enacted policies that are broad minded and the latest rule for STEM OPT extension restoration   from 17 months to 24 months is a case in point. If this step is not taken, I think it will create a long term negative impact on the ability of USA to attract intelligent and innovative people to USA,   as students in future   will try to look at other countries who are waiting in line to seize the opportunity.  This will definitely affect USA badly in the long run if not in short term and can mark the beginning of end of Glorious USA .  I am sure US leaders and policy makers are far too intelligent to allow this to happen.\n\nThough 24 months of extension may be just sufficient to gain in depth practical experience ,  longer the period, better it is for attracting  the best students. Hence 36 months extension will definitely be welcome. However other actions to allow best talent to work longer in US if required by reputed US companies and institutions will be in the best interests of USA and its people.  \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0689","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rajan K."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"   I believe improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is really a good thing.

Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\"\n\nThis is the same kind of thing I ran into in the tech (IT) field with H1-B visas pushed for years by Sens Kennedy and Spectre.  Originally foreign workers were brought in response to big business pushing the impression of a \"labor shortage\" building up to and during Y2K.  While there may have been TEMPORARY shortage during this period, the shortage was short-lived.\n\nEmployers quickly learned they could bring in relatively cheap foreign workers giving preference over qualified American workers.  Each year, the quotas were increased with the jubilant support of Kennedy and Spectre.\n\nEventually, millions such as myself found ourselves out of work with little or no chance of resuming IT positions taken by the visas.\n\nAn indirect outcome of this failed program is, high school and college students soon began abandoning the IT and other tech fields because the once lucrative careers no longer existed - for Americans.  This has lead to a real or imagined shortage of qualified candidates in the field.  A sort of \"self-fulfilled\" prophecy.\n\nThe OPT program will devastate other tech jobs just like the H1-B visa program did to IT.  The workers come, but they never leave.  Result - millions more Americans out of work.  From the cheap seats, it appears this is the government's end game.  Let's not have any more expansion of OPT.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3752","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jim Wascher"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In the history of America, if there is something that defines and distinguishes America more than anything, it's that America is the land of opportunity.

The admissions of US schools are very selective which ensures the quality of international students. International students with Math and Science degrees can contribute a lot to US society and create many more job opportunities for US citizens, for example the Google's new CEO Sundar Pichai. Thanks to OPT extension program, it allows Pichai to practice his expertises for Google and create a lot of innovations.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that the proposed OPT rule has a gray area. On October 6, 2013, USCIS issued a policy memorandum PM602-602-0090, which clarifies that F-1 students engaging in post-completion OPT under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(A) are eligible for the 17-month STEM extension under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C) if they have not yet completed their thesis requirement or equivalent for their STEM degree when applying for the STEM extension. However there is no written updates on SEVIS yet. The SEVIS says before school staff makes a recommend for opt extension, he must make sure the student has already finished his thesis. USCIS policy and SEVIS conflicts with each other. To my understanding, these two departments are both under DHS. They should be consistent. I suggest that please clarify this issue in the new opt extension proposal. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0376","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Olivia Chen, West Virginia University"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think STEM OPT extension is both good to the students with STEM majors and to the economic development of the United States, but the flip side is that this may exclude more H1B applicants whose major is not fell into STEM scale.

Purpose of the Regulatory Action\n\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school.  The regulation seeks cheap labor, not bright students. The F1 non-immigrant classification is available to academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at any established school, even in an accredited language training program. This makes every school a qualifying school. So, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. This definition is so broad that anyone in the world would qualify.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months.  48 months is not temporary.  A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT. As stated in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code, this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B and therefore be eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. \n\nAs stated in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is an employment program only for foreign students.  U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.\n\nG. Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields.\n\nSafeguards of this proposal are deceptive, and in fact are not safeguards at all.  This proposal requires terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers.  At the same time, the regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S.workers. The Regulation does not restrict this to American workers or employers, but to other employers of the same {undefined} size anywhere in the world.  By definition, there are no similarly situated U.S. workers, so no one will meet this definition.  The employer can never be liable for replacing any U.S. Worker.\n\nIt is ridiculous to expect an employer to monitor and record his own actions by attestation.  The employer would be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.\n\nThis Regulation leaves the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers.  This would allow an employer to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign students.\n\nD. Mentoring and Training Plan\n\nThe Regulation has provisions to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign students. The Regulation leaves this to the employer.  DHS plans to have employers show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices.  This ambiguous language is intentional, and prevents the employer from being held liable for violations.\n\nThe Regulation fails to require the use of factual and actual documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers.  It does not require the use of payroll records.  What an employer is paying his current employees is direct evidence.  Instead, the Regulation allows the employer to use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys to report compensation for their U.S. workers. \n\nThe Regulations are contradictory, describing employers hiring highly skilled STEM OPT students.  This is directly contradictory to the stated need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced foreign student.\n\nThe Regulations do not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business.  It opens such definitions to the world by providing the use of  Department of Labor Office of Foreign Labor Certification.\n\nTo protect the U.S. worker, the employer should have to report the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. employee.\n\nThe regulation provides for on-site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should be required to conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet the educational requirements AND to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S.worker is in any way adversely impacted. Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both past and present for the past three years.\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3606","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jack Harper"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The majority of international students are high-educated.

My child was never afforded this subsidy.\nMany of the foreign students were never required to pass the rigorous standardized tests required under \nCommon Core in my state.\n\nForeign students should be required to pass all local math and English proficiency tests required by colleges and universities in the State which they choose to enroll. No double subsidies of scholarships and plus OPT should ever be allowed because local students are not afforded the same subsidy. As a STEM worker, I have never met  non-native English-speaking foreign OPT/H1B workers who could speak English better than U.S. nationals. The vast majority of OPT and H1Bs are lacking in basic English and technical skills.\n\nAs many as 250,000 or more students graduate from U.S. colleges and technical schools and find it very competitive to find work. The market is generating around 125,000 STEM jobs annually, not nearly enough for the new graduates. The claims of labor shortages are provably false by these numbers alone. There is no need for OPT or the F1 or the H1B except in the delusions of management of corporate America.\n\nDHS is putting a mandate on local colleges and universities who will pass along the cost to students and parents in the U.S. already strapped with high tuition costs. I should add, that along with high and rising tuition costs, I face competition from H1Bs who commit rampant degree fraud in obtaining their H1B visas.

Please note the following comments.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III A]  I support the proposal by DHS to reinstate the OPT STEM Extension in response to the judgment issued on August 12, 2015 by the U.S. District Court in the case of Washington Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security. I further hope that the final rule, following the period of public comments and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), will be published at least 60 days before the date of vacatur indicated in the courts judgment, i.e., the final rule be published in the Federal Register 60 days before February 12, 2016. This would allow time for review by Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), so that the final rule will take effect by February 12, 2016.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  I support the proposal by DHS to increase the period of OPT STEM Extension from 17 months to 24 months. Further, I also support the proposal to provide an additional OPT STEM Extension of 24 months for earning a second STEM degree of higher educational level. This regulation implies that if an international student on F-1 visa earns a qualifying STEM Masters and Doctoral degree from an accredited U.S. university, he or she would be eligible for a total of 6 years of practical training in their selected area of study. As a result, the student will be able to obtain valuable work experience and STEM skills, which might not be readily available in the home country of the student.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  The proposed rule by DHS requires students and employers to implement a formal Mentoring and Training Plan that would be submitted to the Designated School Official (DSO) before the OPT STEM Extension is granted. Further, every six months, the student is required to provide the DSO with an evaluation of his or her progress towards the training goals agreed upon. While this requirement is made in good faith, I note that there could be several reasons due to which the training goals might change. For example, the employing company might stop working on a project that was expected to increase the participating students STEM skills, and instead, request him or her to work on different project of similar nature. Therefore, the Mentoring and Training Plan must not require the student and employer to be overly specific regarding the training goals, and how progress towards them would be measured, because the projects and opportunities provided to the student might evolve or change with time.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  I support the proposal by DHS to include the 2008 Interim Final Rules (73 FR 18944) Cap-Gap provision, under which the DHS would temporarily extend an F-1 students duration of status and any current employment authorization if the student is a beneficiary of a timely filed H1-B petition and requests a change of status.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B]  I support the transitional measure proposed by DHS to allow a subset of students already on a 17-month OPT STEM Extension to take advantage of the proposed 24-month OPT STEM Extension by requesting the remaining 7 months of employment authorization up to 120 days before the end of the students 17-month OPT STEM Extension period. DHS has estimated that this proposal will benefit up to 18,210 students.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B]  Please clarify that, according to the proposed rule by DHS, if a students 17- month OPT STEM Extension period has begun, or will begin, before the date of vacatur of the 17-month OPT STEM Extension, and the 17-month practical training period is expected to conclude after the date of vacatur, then such students may continue to undergo practical training after the date of vacatur and remain employed until the end of the 17-month OPT STEM Extension period accorded to them.\n\nTo summarize, I strongly support this proposed regulation, and hope that it will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register in a timely manner, without incorporating significant changes. I note that if the final rule does not take effect before the date of vacatur of the current 17-month OPT STEM Extension, up to 34,000 students who are currently taking advantage of this provision will be forced to resign from the current employment and depart the United States.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0013","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Vinay Krishnan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank DHS for thinking through and proposing a great rule.

This proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they will cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley stated that the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that \"ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\"\n\nI agree with Sam Rolley of Personal Liberty who said \"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.\"\n\nHe further states that \"a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.\"\n\"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\"\n\nThis program is another overreach to disadvantage our own citizens. I am against these new regulations unless the same opportunities are available for our own citizens and I would call for a moratorium on this program until there is an accounting for all the foreign students currently/formerly in this program. This program is out of control and discriminatory.

The reason why it like this is that United States accepts the talents all over the world. If you look back to world war 2.  So many Jewish scientists are accepted by US. which helps the technology grows really fast. So many generals who originally come from Europe help US win the war. The OPT can only be given to the people who has a degree in US which means they are really well educated. If we let them go, other countries will be really happy since they can get the talents without paying much. But they can grow faster and faster. I don't think in that situation US will keep competitive in the world.  US may becomes more and more like some European countries which have wonderful benefits but lazy people. So it is the international students make United States much different. Why can't we keep them to make the country better. If we want to know who take the opportunity for local Americans in technology. You can see that Indian ICC get half of the H1b each year. And they can move Indian people without having the degree in US. I don't think they are qualified enough.

If the OPT extension rule were revoked, most likely countless US companies and organizations will suddenly lose competent employees, and years of effort and investment spent on training them. In the long run, revoking the STEM OPT extension rule will further hurt the willingness of STEM major students, who were born outside of US but received high education in US, to contribute their knowledge and skills to US economy. US companies will also face the problem of having fewer choices when recruiting qualified employees. \n\nAdditionally, the 24-month OPT extension allows STEM students more time to prepare for their start-ups, which will bring more job opportunities to US citizens. As a STEM major student, my long term goal is to start a company that provides cloud-based intelligent devices. My research area during M.S program has been focused on designing affordable intelligent medical devices, and my invention has already been brought to third world countries and helped people there. I believe there are numerous job opportunities that highly-educated STEM students can create, and this new OPT rule will definitely help ensure those new job opportunities are created in US.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2407","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jingxi Lu, University of Michigan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support the proposal of having the OPT STEM extention period to be 24 or 36 months.

American technology workers increasingly oppose the H-1B program and other means by which US corporations and universities seek to import cheap, indentured labor. This OPT proposal, like its predecessors, is a too-clever attempt by Big Academia and Big Tech to subvert the H-1B caps which American technology workers strongly support.\n\nAs Ron Hira et al have shown, there is no need for degreed graduates of US STEM academic programs to be treated as interns in need of 3 years of further training. This OPT provision merely seeks to provide Big Tech's bosses with more cheap, indentured labor, circumventing the H-1B cap. As Daniel Costa notes, this proposal allows bosses to decide whatever wage is appropriate for the OPT foreign worker, and this proposal's worker protections \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.\" This proposal will only serve to further depress already-stagnant STEM compensation and working conditions, and to force more US citizens to seek alternate career paths.\n\nAs John Miano indicates, this OPT proposal requires US corporations and universities to provide mentoring programs for OPT-eligible *foreign* students, but not for citizen students. This OPT plan, like (but even worse than) its predecessors, will only increase the US STEM brain drain by driving talented citizen students out of STEM, and to replace them with foreign students who are (as Norman Matloff has demonstrated) no more talented (on a variety of measures), but who are much more profitable for US corporations and universities. This OPT plan will also aggravate the age discrimination in US STEM, which has increased in severity as succeeding US administrations have increased importation of young, cheap foreign labor.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2763","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Tom Roche"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I object to this effort by the Obama administration to effectively bypass Congress and create a shadow H1-B program by increasing the length of stay under the optional practical training program visa. \n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThis expansion has nothing to do with training and everything to do with addressing the demands of tight fisted larg corporate employers like Disney who just want to lower their costs so that their executives can pay themselves ever larger bonuses.\n\nThe next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3807","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Drew McDonald"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support STEM extension for reasons.\n\n1) it is necessary to benefit from Hi-Tech talents that created from our educational system.\n2) it encourage people overseas to come to usa for higher education because they may work after graduation. when they come here, they consume and stimulate the economy.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0730","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Qin Peng, CCAC"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This good news for all international students. First of all it allows me to work longer after school and get more on hand experience, which is very useful when I get back to China. Nowadays with the increase of out of broad study, the abroad work experience has become more of a factor to value a student's skills. This purpose will definitely benefit millions of international students like me. Second, with the longer OPT for STEM students, America can attract more international students to come here to study. Therefore, it increases diversity of schools. Also, with more and better international students coming to US to study, it will make more of a competitive environment in colleges and I believe it would also help with campus drinking and drug problems. On the other hand, in recent years, there are more and more foreign students who finished a degree in the US and got a job offer with sponsorship, but could not stay to continue making contribution to the country just because of the H1B cap. With the extension of OPT, some of them might have another chance to win the lottery. I think losing foreign educated high tech labors is a big loss for America at this time when the economic is getting better and better. Before the government take any action on the H1B cap, this is a very effective way which benefits both foreign students and thousands of American companies.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0224","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Mei Liu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think this proposal is another slap in the face to natural born citizens!!

I do strongly believe that 24 months OPT extension will benefit all of us. This will give the students time to file their H-1B visa, since the lottery system is in place for H-1B.

This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3140","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Keerthi Raj Nagaraja"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am so glad to hear about this new rule regarding OPT extension for F1 student.

However, foreign students are using this program as a bridge to stay in the US and employers are using it to get cheaper labor and get around the H-1B caps.\n\nAt present, there are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the US, another almost 100,000 are in 12-month OPT programs and still another 30,000 are in 29 month OPT programs.  This is already a too big pool of nearly 700,000 foreign student who are being trained at our expense to take away jobs from American STEM workers.  Here is why that is very bad for America:\n\nOPT workers are younger so they are cheaper (Salary) to employ, but they are far less experienced, too.  In addition, employers don't have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes for OPT employee, who do receive benefits without having to pay for them.  The OPT workers holds down a good paying job ($60,000 to $90,000) keeping American STEM workers out of work while costing Social Security more than 1 Billion dollars annually in unearned benefits.\n\nWhen this program was created by congress, it was obvious that the intent was to have these students go back to their original country.  It has been modified, and your proposing to further modify it to make it more and more likely that these students WILL stay in the US and further unfairly compete with American STEM workers.  This is CLEARLY against the original intent of congress (by creating a shadow H-1B program) and the best interest of the American people.    \n\nLastly, the GAO says that this program is \"inefficient\" and \"susceptible to fraud\".  Further, the GAO says that the DHS does not track the living and working locations of these foreign students to know if they have over stayed their visas or if the students have become security threats and would not track them under the new proposed rule.  This is a major deficiency in the rule and a major security threat to the US.\n\nThe new proposed rule should not go in to effect.  In fact, the OPT program should be phased out or eliminated all together so that unemployed American STEM workers can have increased opportunity for employment.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3478","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by John Ahern"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully support the new change of extending the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of 17 months.

It also provides  help to foreign students that is not available to American students. The proposed rule also runs counter to the original purpose of OPT which was to give foreign students more tools help their home countries when they return home. We say we want to help the citizens of poor countries yet we keep the very ones who can improve the conditions in their home countries. This is counter productive.\n\n   Today the US has a greater proportion of its workers out of the workforce than at any time including the great depression. Why is this? Could it be because we have the highest percentage of foreigners living and working in the US since we first became a country. Today American workers face discrimination in the workplace by employers because of policies promulgated by their own government and OMT is one such policy. American companies prefer these \"students\" because programs such as this make them cheaper to hire than American graduates with the the same or superior skills. Employers save as a minimum the employers share of payroll taxes, 7.65%, and probably the employees share, 7.65%, also when they hire these students\" instead of Americans because they don't pay FICA or medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often receive pay in the $60,000 to $90,000 range thereby costing Social Security about $One Billion a year. As an American it makes no sense to work for a STEM degree when your own government discriminates against you in getting a job.\n\n    \"Expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT)-through which employers hire more than 120,000 young graduates per year who hold F 1 degrees-chase Americans out of computer science\"  Richard Trumka,  Pres.

America needs work for its own people. Few if any other countries would be so foolish. The \"skills shortage\" is just another word for diluting professional standards of living to transfer wealth to the very top economic elite who show no loyalty whatsoever to this country, and hostility to the interests of its citizens. The proposal is yet again creation of scab labor by another name.\n\nThere are plenty of foreign students to give cultural \"seasoning\" to American academic life. More foreign students and less American students who can afford an education in this country in competition with foreign students is not in this country's interest. We are heading to a foreign technical elite running the technical life of this country which to no small degree is already underway. This is a foreign technical elite that has proven very adept at transferring more and more American jobs or what once might have been American jobs back to their country of origin. Certainly American students studying in their countries to take their local jobs would never, ever be tolerated.\n\nAmericans wanting to participate in the advanced skill job market will be increasing forced to seek cheaper education outside of the US, completely reversing what should be considered desirable. Ever more marginally funded public State schools look for the big bucks from foreign students rather than catering first to their citizens. This program will take one more step towards converting every public institution of higher learning into a private school for the global elite.\n\nIncreasingly the current generation of young males seeing what is happening have simply become discouraged and dropped out of advanced education altogether. More and more they are missing in action. Thus there is an increasing crisis of diversity in American education, namely the dwindling number of males actually graduating from higher education.\n\nYet again the power elite wants to make it worse again for the middle class to survive and they appear to have the full backing of politicians obsessed solely with campaign donations.\n\nAmong the less developed countries, as opposed to China and India in particular, keeping skilled graduates here denies them to their home countries where they are needed.\n\nOn the other hand, if I really hated the United States of American and every thing for which it stands, I would heartily and without reservation endorse this program.

I came to US in 2008 and am currently finishing my PhD. The education provided a rich depth of knowledge in field of semiconductors. But when I recently started to apply for full time positions, most of the openings require some sort of experience. This makes me ineligible to apply for most of the currently available jobs. \n\nThe 12 month OPT period will provide me with time to gain experience and build my professional resume. However, in order to work as a full time employee in US, I have to apply for a H1B visa in April next year. This will ensure that I can stop my OPT training period and continue as a full time employee. \n\nHowever, the allocation of H1B is done completely based on luck. The lottery system does not guarantees fairness to PhD students who spend much longer time in completing their graduate studies over MS students. Further, PhD students are a better value addition to US workforce compared to MS students. So, preference should be given to PhD students as far as allocation of H1B visa is concerned.\n\nIf I do not get a H1B visa awarded in the lottery system (which is completely unfair and does not take into account any merit based allocation of visas), I have to leave the country at the end of my 12 month OPT period. This means that I will have to leave country for a year and hope to get lucky in the lottery system next year. However, this is not guaranteed and I may have to wait several years before I may get a H1B visa. \n\nThis is a terrible misuse of money and effort which goes towards training STEM students, especially students who spent 5-8 years getting a PhD degree. Federal government and different funding agencies spent a considerable amount of money training a skilled work force. This workforce should be allowed to assimilate and contribute back to the prosperity of US economy. \n\nThere is already a shortage of skilled labor force in US. Terminating work authorization for STEM students will erode the strong and highly skilled workforce which US needs in order to stay competitive in this global economic environment. US is slowly losing its manufacturing jobs to India, China and other developing countries. In order to stay competitive, US needs to lead in higher technology and research environments which will help to maintain its dominant leader position.

However, since there is a high chance of not getting H1b visa due to the lottery policy within the duration of OPT at the moment, many of the new hires who are not able to get valid work permission in time have to be either relocated to other countries if their companies support, or simply to be laid off. This unfortunately results in (1) huge waste of energy and resources in the hiring and training for the new employees, (2) increased cost in relocating the employees, and (3) inefficiency in communication and collaboration for cross-country projects.  \n\nIn addition, given the concern about getting the working permit in a very short time, STEM candidates are more likely to prefer companies with foreign branches so that they can be relocated out of US when they don't get H1b in time. This makes the small businesses and startups less competitive in hiring great people, and thus less likely to survive.

Firstly, most of the OPT students around 70 % are misusing OPT period by joining an INC Consultancy faking their resume or identity following illegal, unethical process. Secondly, OPT students are never been paid until and unless they get a contract job with the client and will be paid mostly on 70-30 percentage basis. What is this percentage basis? i will tell you suppose if a consultant gets a contract job with client and if he is paid 60 dollars per hour as a billing rate then the the consultant gets 70 % of it and consultancy gets 30% of it. Every consultancy says that consultant is paid on salary basis but no everyone are paid in percentage basis if he has a job he is paid if not no he will not be paid. I agree that some are genuine OPT students who does not do any unethical or illegal activity but the ration of genuine to fake/unethical students who utilize/mis-utilize OPT is 20%:80%. Whats the use of it and at whats costing USA for this i.e. agreeing to OPT rule will be no doubt mis-utilized. Faking at least 8-10 years of experience which is costing less number of jobs available to genuine people. Yes there will be more people who supports OPT rule mostly students because they have spent money for their masters by taking loan and other stuff but if they really want a job they have to get a job in ethical in a lawful way. But i am one of the person who genuinely writing to let you know please don't, don't invite unlawful activity again. People in OPT can go for genuine full time jobs but they will not get as they don't have experience or will not be paid much so they will be told by all these INC consultancies that if they will fake their resume and do little hard work at client's location they will paid good money so almost every student opts for that. Do observe all the negative comments who are not supportive to this new rule cause we want to say reality. Media please make a documentary of this illegal activity and upload it in you-tube i am sure everyone will be surprised of it.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2979","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ryan R."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I completely agree that the OPT extension goes as long as 24 months.

These STEM students have been contributing to the development of technology, science and finance in the past years. Besides, the money they spent for their daily life, entertainment and work has also been a great stimulate to the grocery, tourism and so on. What's more, the tuition from international students is now major income of lots of universities and colleges, thus reduce our own cost in education. \nFinally, these training opportunities help to reduce the human resource cost for the employers. Therefore, the employers can get better talents with lower price, to grow their business.\nThis is why I think this rule benefits the United States and therefore it should be admitted.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Tianyi Yang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support this new change in OPT Extension and I personally believe that this rule would bring more and more bright minds to USA.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1495","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by VamsiKrishna Bezavada"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs, and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs.

International students are essential to keeping the US Economy at bay and keeping corporations staffed to ensure continuous improvement and research. Also, universities earn a good portion of their money through international student fees which is at least 4 times an instate student fees. Therefore, the 24 month rule will aid in attracting students to join universities in America. In the absence of the rule, students will no longer want to study abroad, thereby reducing the money earned by universities, which then reduces the amount universities can spend on research which again reduces the development of the country.

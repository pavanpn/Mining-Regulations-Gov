As a new graduate with STEM degree, I just started to work. My life and career is just starting to get clear. If I can only keep my job for a year, because of lack of experience to find another job in my home country, it will definitely cause confusion and frustration in my career path. \n\nIn the future, I am afraid that there will be fewer and fewer  foreign students pursuing higher degree in the US since we can only stay here for a year and it is almost impossible to find a job to practice within only one year. If I was an employer, I wouldn't even consider to hire any OPT employees because of the instability. \n\nBecause of fewer students, of course, there will be less investment into the projects the universities are working on. If anybody ask me why the United States has the best technology and development, i will say it all rely on the huge amount of investments. Germany is a well developed country, why their technology is not improving as fast as US? Because they don't ask for tuition fee, their technology development all depends on the investment of the government.  I have studied in Germany for one year and half, i can definitely be sure that german students are as intelligent or even more intelligent than the students in the US.\n\nThe reason why US is still ahead of Germany or any other developed countries is because in the US, there are a lot of good universities, and the development of the country rely on these universities. These universities' investment comes mostly from tuition fee and foreign students are paying much much more than the domestic student.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1905","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jiaran Sun"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It would be great for many foreign students as well as companies who are in desperate need for well-trained people.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1149","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jacqueline Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is really Good decision made by DHS to help U.S.A Economy and as well as foreign international students","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Shas A."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\n1. OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n2. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nJust these two takeaways reveal how devastating this rule will be to our U.S. citizens:\n1. Adding to the 93 plus million US citizens already out of work; and\n2. Taking more money away from US senior citizens at a time when more has been removed from Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3359","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sally Vose"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am disgusted beyond words that my own government is more interesting in helping foreigners find jobs that helping a natural born U.S. citizen myself, I have been struggling to find work for a decade even though I have a STEM degree from Cornell University. Companies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse H1-B and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas. The H1-B and OPT programs should be eliminated, and the U.S. government should focus on programs that match Americans to employers and make \"older\" workers (35+) a better investment to the company by creating incentives. This kind of program is what the American middle-class desperately needs before it disappears altogether.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0968","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Joseph Palos"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is very necessary for both US and people like us. \nIt should be win win situation for both.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0122","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rajat Bansal"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Extending the OPT period will be good for nonimmigrant students so that they have a choice to use their skills helping the MNC's in USA.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0625","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rajeshwar Reddy Velpucharla"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Such a good news!

It covers all think-able situations that either the USCIS or the student can come into up on finishing there 1 year OPT period.\n\nStudents are the budding backbone of an economy from paying tuition fees and taxes included to finally landing a professional position based out of there degrees is not only a journey that build character at a personal level. But also builds the economy inch by inch. And I am not talking of just diligent and persevering student but all of them. As they go, they bring back economies from recessions and reinforces the financial status of a country such as US.\n\nThe more loans we can pay back the better it is not only for us but for the economy.\nSTEM OPT focuses majorly on Technology industries. And technology these goes through rapid disruptive innovations. A professional with newly gained skills on the upcoming technology is the best fit to take the load on of millions of requirements posted not only by private sector companies but also public. \n\nThe STEM OPT makes sure talent such as that stays where they are needed without any hassles that may jeopardize not only their position but also the important work that needs to be done. \n\nThis country is and was made on hard work. As quoted by the Deceleration of Independence of the US of A, that whomsoever have the power and will to make a change when it is needed in times of dire needed by the  people is responsible to provide them. It is there duty to stand up for the just and help the needful. \n\nThe 24 month rule is a wise decision in my opinion as it fulfills the 5 years F-1 Visa that the students come up on. It keeps everything fair and everyone has a chance at pursuing the American Dream and providing back 2 folds to the community they work in. By paying there taxes and advancing the ridiculously complicated industry sectors that take a arm and a leg to learn understand and implement in a very short of amount of time. \n\nThank you DHS for the rule I hope it gets passed. The work I do day in and day out is so unique and a part of the niche market of sorts. My position took the employer 1.4 years to find. \n\nI work very hard at my job to provide quality work and learn as I go. I would really like to work more and learn more in my field. \n\nThank you for all your efforts in keeping everything fair for us students as well. \nThank you for your time. \nWishing you the best of luck.\n\n\nGod bless USA","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Abhi Thakral"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'd like better understanding,as to why our once great country,would further its decline by offering unprotected rights,incentives,to foreign workers in this program.

Thanks to the OPT extension, employers can hire enough talent international students and have long time to sponsor H1B visa for them. Longer legal working period and more opportunity to apply for H1B visa produce result of less employee turnover, and thus saving money for companies. Also because more STEM students can stay in the US, companies can easily find their desired employees in such a various and sufficient market of employees.

I read tons of articles where students from the prestigious Harvard and Stanford are getting kicked out of the nation because they were not picked up in a H-1 lottery. Canadian and Dutch government are offering those students everything to get them to their countries because they recognize the mettle these students have.\n\nWhat's more horrifying is not even getting close to the H-1 process. I consider STEM-extension as a reward to all the hardworking STEM students who put all their money, energy and time to the American education system to strengthen their mettle with the great American firms and to equally provide to the American economy. More than anything, American will lose the trust among the internationals if this STEM-extension is taken away from them.\n\nWhat does not make sense to me is- a STEM person would make more money than an average American job holder, which means paying more taxes to the economy. Being an economically focused nation, I fail to understand why would America consider kicking out all these high paying individuals. I would be able to write for days if I have to point out flaws in the American immigration system but the fact that DHS has come out with a new rule before the deadline is commendable and is appreciated.\n\nI must applaud the DHS for having put forward a rule and taking the matter seriously. An excellent proposed rule being put forward.  A 24-month window would give a student more time to strengthen his training experience with a US-based firm. It would allow him or her to strengthen his position with the employer that he is working with and gives a fair amount of time before considering into a employment visa.\n\nI'm a masters student from UNL, graduated last summer and working with a corporate. I'm currently on STEM-extension and if this rule is not passed by February, I will be kicked out. And I'm sure, a lot of good students like me.

Many of our very skilled, very experienced innovators are losing jobs... many STEM students cannot find jobs and are thousands of dollars in debt for their trouble of getting specialized education.  \n \nThis unfair and illegal practice must be stopped. \n\nI agree with the following letter, and respectfully but forcefully request that this proposed rule by DHS on 10-19-2015 be denied. \n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3589","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Betty Jackson"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am resuesting you to consider DMD and DDS as STEM degrees please.

This rule would definitely help me, and it can even further help my wife who was also not selected at H-1B lottery this year. Her OPT STEM extension expires in December 2015 and I was hoping this rule, which gives her 7 more months of OPT, will be implemented sooner allowing her to have one more chance at H-1B. I would like to further suggest changing this rule in a way such that people like my wife who will potentially be in the 60-day grace period after expiration of OPT status (Feb 2015 for my wife) would also be able to use this extension. This will give them another chance to apply for H-1B and keep contributing to American economy. My wife was awarded her master's degree in a microbiology-molecular biology combined program from University of Minnesota- Twin Cities and she is currently working as a scientist in a leading diagnostic company. She works on projects that will be making real difference for patients not just in America but all over the world. She would have to stop working in December even though she has a published thesis and years of experience. Only other alternative we have is both of us leave US and rebuild our future elsewhere.\n \nAnother reason that this rule should be implemented as soon as possible is the number of applications submitted for H-1B are getting higher and higher (more than 220,000 in 2015). This leads to a significant decrease in the chances of students, who have spent years here studying and honing their skills, getting a H-1B visa. It is difficult to understand the point of sending away highly skilled workers who were educated here and are already well-versed and immersed with the US culture, and instead bringing in lesser skilled foreign educated workers every year though H-1Bs. Especially the students who spent more than 5 years doing PhD in US having to go back to their home countries because of this is just not a fair system. In current rule, a student can receive one 24-months extension and can get another 24-months extension if he/she pursues and completes a higher STEM degree. This makes it unfair for students who are pursuing PhD. Once they are done with their degree, they can only get one extension as there is no higher degree to pursue. This rule should allow the students who have completed PhD degree to take two 24 months extension if they have not taken any previous extension.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2418","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Govind Saraswat"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support this proposal very much.

Weve paid our taxes, worked hard to contribute to society and have invested much into living here as good citizens. Over the years Ive held different visas, first as a dependent and later as an independent holding my own F-1 visa. The US is my home and where I was raised but now my entire world is in jeopardy because STEM OPT may or may not exist in the next few months. If you dont approve this rule, I, an American in spirit, would have to leave my home. \n\nIm the eldest of my family and serve as integral support and principal earner. If I were to leave, my family would be left in crisis. I have a brother in med school, a mortgage to pay, and two car payments. The loss of my income would be crippling. \n\nNow, you may not care for one random contributing member of your society but I represent thousands in the same position. So many would suffer. Large companies or small and too many individuals to count. Major companies would have to retrain thousands at the cost of possibly millions. Smaller companies (such as mine) would lose valuable members that contribute and push small businesses forward. You would cut off those who willingly and eagerly contribute to the life blood of the American dream. This rule carries economic significance for the immigrant and nonimmigrant alike. \n\nAmerica is a land of immigrants, you know that. Talented individuals come here from other countries and contribute directly to this society. Why brain drain that talent out? Why not keep the US competitive for longer? The economy needs a strong and intelligent workforce. \n\nNow, with regards to the rule itself and its content, I see many aspects that will burden both international students and the government itself. On the one hand the DHS is doing right by those concerned about American jobs but they may not be doing right by themselves. Providing mentorship programs is a good idea on paper but who on earth is going to process them all? And wont adding something else to approve delay STEM OPT approvals even more? Ive waited nearly 3 months for my own already and adding a mentorship program to that would only increase wait times. Delays are to be expected but grace periods and additional cap-gap policies would need to be written to accommodate for the new requirements. Would people need to apply 6 months ahead of time instead of 3? What happens to those within their 60 day grace periods before OPT begins? \n\nWith regards to the expansion of the extension to 24 months, I approve. It is a more reasonable number and allows a student to contribute to a company for a less arbitrary amount of time. An employer knows that their qualified and eligible employee will be available for a full 2 years after initial OPT. My current pending application will likely be processed as a 17 month extension but I appreciate that I can apply for the remaining available months. My only concern is how much it will cost to apply. The $380 (along with university fees) are a heavy burden and it would be unreasonable to make those who dont get the 24 month extension first pay a high amount for something that was out of their control. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1411","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Tawfiq Bhuiyan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I will support this rule because there are lot of skilled students coming from all over the world.

Extending the OPT for STEM students not only benefits these international students but also benefits the people here and the development of the country and economic. \nTechnology is the main trend of the development. There are lots of demands for STEM major jobs/positions in the market. This rule creates the supplement for this demand, and benefits the development of the economic. There will be certainly damages to many companies whose current employees are students and holding the OPT visa. Those employees are well educated after school, and well trained after one to two years intern in the company. They are talented, experienced workers, and ready to make their contributions to the company, but may have to leave the company and back to their countries if this rule doesn't pass. It's certainly a loss to these companies since it costs a lot to hire and train these people, and eventually would hurt the economic. \nI know many Americans worried about their job opportunities. They thought these students will take their jobs instead, but I don't think so. All of the companies are here for profits. Each jobs have requirements. It's not because they are STEM international students that the company hire them, it's because they are the right people who fits the positions well. Those students here are only making the job market more competitive, and competition only generates good results, like higher standards, more productive, and etc. If you can't take the job, no matter you are Americans or international students, it's not about the legal status, it's because you are not good enough for this position. Even though this rule passed, if the international students can't find the jobs, they cannot stay. \nThirdly, America is an immigration country. The culture is very diversified. The reason why America developed so rapidly in a short time is because the country is open to everyone, especially those talented people. If the people here worried about losing the jobs to these people, and turn them back, America will loss lots of talented persons/genius/engineers, etc, which is certainly not good for the development of the US.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\n \n\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2013 with a master's degree in the field of IT. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT:\nFirst, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Second, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nI urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

There should possibly be rules that address more convenient ways for students who have invested and graduated from accredited American universities to be able to continue being employed in the US.

If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? Do you people really hate America this much? Here's some reasons why this rule is a crock of shit!\n\n*OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n\n*OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n* The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. Today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\n*There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\n* OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jo bs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n* The Obama Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\n\n*The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\n\n*The proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\n\n*The rule requires these organizations to set up mento ring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\n\n* On a variety of measures, the foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers. Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\nlace.\n\n* In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans.

For non-STEM areas, OPT STEM does not apply to international students at all, which means the work opportunities available to US citizens in these areas will not be reduced at all. On the other hand, in STEM areas, although OPT STEM allows more international talents to work in US, it will also increase the absolute amount of working opportunities to US citizens in the long term.\n\nPeople with extraordinary skills are the key to improve the power of the country and push the development of the society. This is especially true in STEM areas. United States, as a country built by talents from all over the world, is currently the most creative, most productive and strongest country in the world. This is due to its open policy for importing talents, regardless of their citizenship. However, talents now find it harder and harder to stay in US to use their extraordinary ability. The limitations on immigration policy is already out-of-date, and the existence of H1B lottery is a good proof it. There is an urgent need to improve this situation. A country without rapid economics increases will never have enough energy to create sufficient open jobs in the market, making the country less attractive to hi-tech workers, thus slowing down its development even more. This is a negative feedback, which will eventually take US out from the top place in the list of countries attractive to talents, weaken its economy and technology rankings in the world, and reduce the amount of available open jobs. This impairs benefits of both US citizens of international talents, hence we should not allow it to happen.\n\nBy contrast, the 24 month OPT STEM is the ideal solution to turn it into a positive-feedback and benefits both US citizens and international talents together. International students studying in the US usually have better skills in their studying areas compared to people staying in their own countries. The key to maintain a sustainable development of the workforce market is to keep these talents in the US. 24 month OPT STEM gives US employers more time to hire international talents, providing these talents with longer duration to contribute to US. Moreover, it also gives US employers longer time to filter out the best from the best people, and make their workforce most productive and of highest quality. Another benefit of 24 month OPT STEM is, it gives hi-tech workers more chances to apply for H1B work VISA, improving the likelihood of their long-term staying in the US and continuous contribution to the US economy. Only by keeping the top level workforce can the US job market keep growing and provide larger amount of jobs to US citizens.\n\nMaintaining the attractiveness to talents worldwide is the key to ensure the overall welfare of US people and government, as well as an energetic job market filled with more opportunities for US people. There is no reason to the reject such a good rule.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2424","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Kaiyu Yan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"F-1 Nonimmigrants students with STEM Degrees do the work that many American don't want to do.

International students put in a lot of effort and incur a lot of expenditure to come to the US to pursue education. The OPT provides a constructive way to build an relevant experience in their filed of specialization. A duration of one year (the initial OPT period) is insufficient to build the foundation of a good career and if they are forced to go back after a brief period of just one year then it would be a major setback to their career.\n\nSuch an outcome would dissuade future international students to come to the US to pursue higher education. International students make a huge contribution to the teaching and research carried out in US schools and greatly increase its diversity. Such a system benefits both the schools and the students and should not be put in jeopardy.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2561","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Chandan M."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi There,\n\nI think this is a great proposal and I completely agree with that.

If this rule is not passed the number of students coming to study in U.S. will drastically decline and will be a great loss to the U.S. economy\n\n2)Also the jobs for which STEM students apply for are available for every one U.S. nationals as well as International students.

On the other hand there are many jobs for which only U.S. nationals can apply, so this gives them more opportunities over STEM students.\n\n3)There is currently a shortage of people with degree in STEM fields in U.S..

I have personally seen that their basic education and master's program has no direct correlation to the job that they perform. They get trained on information technology skill based tools manipulate the resume and get the job. I have seen instances of students showing 7 plus years as experience when they have actually gone to school in the period. My logic's define that  the rightful student playing by the rule book is deprived of a job. One can just search Dice.com, monster.com,indeed.com and see this OPT student's profiles and the company's marketing; the rates per hour are mind blowing. The start up salary is upwards of 70,000 per annul. Second the social security and Medicare taxes are exempted for the students this is also unfair. A typical American student would accomplish his master program with upwards of $100,000 in education expenses. Whereas the international student would have spent around $30,000 for the master program. I feel the Cap-gap Relief needs better statutory law defined with regulatory or administrative control by the department of labor and immigration.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0695","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Krishna Arval"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Gentlemen;\n\nI find it incredible that the United States is increasingly giving preference to foreign workers over the unemployed American citizen.\n\nA number of years ago one of my associates, a Christian pastor was called to serve a congregation in Canada.

Since these companies already had competent workers in these jobs, the only reason they were replaced is because the incoming workers were CHEAPER! So, please, no excuses that there is a worker shortage in this country because that is a lie.  Which further begs the question, why can't these same training programs be offered to our American citizens to be able to find employment.\n\nAll things considered, this is just a shadow program of the H-1B program which is already too expansive.  Since 2000 virtually all new jobs have gone to immigrants which is why our labor participation rate is at 1977 levels.  You need to first assure all American citizens who want work can find it.

From my experience, international students in STEM fields tend to be relatively more motivated to excel academically than other students. Given the fact that we also pay a tremendous amount of college tuition, often without financial aid, I believe it is only fair that we are given adequate opportunities to pursue such academic experience through OPT as well as enough time to gain concrete experience. Being an international student from Ghana pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, I have experienced a number of disappointments regarding gaining internships due to my citizenship status and knowing that the current OPT system only allows 17 months to gain such experience makes tertiary education in the United States very daunting for my fellow-international students and me. Since we also have the academic qualifications to attain such employment, I believe this new extension would greatly benefit not only us but also the United States as a whole.

The situation over the employment of U.S. citizen STEM workers continues to deteriorate year after year, as employers continually try to replace us with cheaper foreign labor.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training (OPT) already gives employers substantial financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans, and has, in fact, done quite a bit of damage to our employability already.

DHS had a real opportunity to reform the OPT program to give a fair treatment to American workers with this rule, but the proposed rule falls short in several areas that I listed below -\n\n1. The biggest weakness of the OPT program has always been that its a subsidy for employers as they are exempt from FICA taxes, which can result in substantial savings for employers over long term. This makes them tacitly discriminate against American works. This rule does nothing to address this shortcoming. The rule should change to make the employers pay the FICA taxes when hiring OPT students\n\n2. The provisions to make sure employers paying the OPT workers same wage as American workers are quite weak. I have worked with OPT workers in my previous jobs. Most of these workers are under a lot of pressure to obtain H1b visas from their current employer. So, they work for any kind of wages as long as the employer is willing to sponsor them a H1b visa. The only way to enforce this is to modify the rule to make sure the employers submit a Labor condition application to certify that they are going to pay the OPT student the current prevailing wage.\n\n3. The duration for which the OPT student is allowed to work in most cases will be substantially longer than the time the F-1 student spends in school. Most of the F-1 students coming in STEM fields come to study Masters degrees in US universities, which in most cases take around 1 year to 1.5 year to complete. It does not make any sense to let these students do an internship for 3 years, given that most of them did a 1 year course. It would make a little more sense to give Phd grads 3 years of work permit, but for Masters grad its just a completely illogical thing to do. So, the rule should be modified to give the 3 years OPT only to Phd grads, or to Master's grads who study for more than 2 years\n\n4. The OPT rule's Mentoring and Training plan is a decent provision to make sure the student is sticking to his field of study. But again, how is this enforced? Does DHS have funds to do onsite audits of OPT program, given that DHS is not charging any additional fees for it on OPT application? Where is the money to do the audits coming from? \n\nThanks again for your time and consideration.

Without extension, I only have 12 months to stay in US. This means once I am familiar with the work, my deadline is just there.  Once I am ready to create more value for US, I have to leave. Of course, I can apply for H-1 B to stay longer. But,  I will graduate this December 2015 and if I want to stay in US after that 12 month, the best way is to find a job with H-1 B sponsor before April 2016(Because there is only one chance to be selected in H1B every year), and I only have one chance with 12 month. This means I only have 3 months to find such job after my graduation and if I fail to find the sponsored job before April, I do not have any extra chance to apply for H1B.  This might have several consequences. First, I might  not have motivation to work so hard for that company, because I know it does not matter how hard I work, I can not work for that company longer once my OPT is due. Second, the company need to waste a lot of money hiring new people and training them. The thing needs to be pointed out is that these new hired people might also be F-1 students, and thus it is a bad cycle for the company because once the new people is ready for the work, they might need to go because of limited OPT. Therefore, if OPT is short, both students and companies can be in an unstable situation, this is not good for the US economy. \n\nSecond,24-months extension is better than 17 month extension. The objective of OPT Extension is to allow most intelligent , most skillful ,and most useful student have opportunity to stay in US sharpen their skills and devote to US. Then why not giving these  satisfied students more time? If they are not good enough, they will be eliminated naturally;but if they are good, why not being more generous to them and giving them more time to show their value and let you know they deserve?Every stem student in US is not only spending a lot of money in US, but also always has skills you want. They always worked so hard in their home country to be outstanding enough to get the offer in US university. They are prepared for the world and can be shining in every country. Then why you do not take this advantage to use them? \n\nThird, with more extension,students can find a career without considering too much about the due day of their OPT. If OPT is not long enough, students have to consider too much about their status,because before they have enough experience, the status crisis is already around the corner. This means they might have to accept a company they do not want only if the company agrees to give them status. This always means students can not show their biggest value in that company.\n\nPlease give more time to F-1 Stem Student. They deserve you favor and won't let you down. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0365","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Xiaohe Huang, University of Southern California"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Generally I think the new rule is very good, for the following reasons:\n\n1.International students are mostly much smarter than domestic students in the same universities, because US universities give strong preference to US students over international students in the admission process. That is, if two students have similar academic achievements, one of whom is US citizen and the other is foreigner, then US universities will definitely admit the US citizen FIRST. So those international students admitted by US universities are generally smarter than the average US students US universities admitted. So the common occurrence is that most of the students who earn a GPA of 4.0 in US universities are international. As a result, to make US universities contribute more to US economy, those smart international students must be given permission to work in US to contribute to US industry.\n\n2. Industry need more smart employees to develop. As I said in the above paragraph, international students are generally smarter than US citizens in the same universities. So US industry need those smart people.\n\n3. Giving international students more permission to work can prevent them from returning to their own countries to compete with US. It's a foolish to train a smart student and then tell them to return to our competitors. Although US is the greatest country in the work but recently its status is being challenged by countries like China. OPT extension can prevent smart people from returning to China and promote their ability to compete.\n\nSome opponents may claim US has enough STEM graduates and many US STEM graduates work in non-STEM field. I cannot agree with them because:\n\n1. There are many reasons why many US STEM graduates don't work in STEM field. Some of them may be that other fields are more profitable than STEM field. For example, many MIT STEM graduates work as real estate agents, which is NOT a STEM field. Because many real estate agents have much higher salaries than STEM field. The house prices in San Francisco is extremely high. Selling a house with price of 2 million dollars in San Francisco can give 120 thousand dollars to the agent. If an agent can sell 10 houses per year then he can earn 1.2 million dollars, which is much higher than if he/she remains in STEM field. So many US graduate volunteer to go to non-STEM field because of a higher salary. So many US STEM graduates work in non-STEM field does NOT lead to the conclusion that US has enough STEM graduates.\n\n2. Even if there are enough STEM graduates, it still does NOT mean every sub-field in STEM has enough graduates. For example, US is in shortage of graduates with Computer Science major. That's why most of the H1B and EB green cards are given to Computer Science workers, while there are quite few workers in other STEM field are given H1B or EB green card. So it's necessary to give more working permission to Computer Science students to meet the demand of US labor market, even if there are enough STEM graduates in field other than Computer Science.\n\nBesides, the new rule proposal does a very good job in preventing employers from hiring cheap international students because it requires the wage of OPT graduates cannot be lower than US graduates. It's very good.\n\nFinally, I want to propose some minor changes to the new rule:\n\n1. It seems employers are required to provide something like training plans for OPT students. I don't think that's necessary because every employer have plans for their employees, even if their don't submit it to USCIS. This step is completely redundant.\n\n\nThank you ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2217","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Zhehao Li"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"    General Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\tThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\tOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n\tOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3181","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Q.

Whatever the student learns during the course of masters, he should be able to apply the learnt techniques in real world and see the results. The OPT allows students to do this. But, the initial 12 month OPT is a very less time frame. Typically a project takes more than 12 months in many cases. Hence, the 17 month extension plays a vital role in continuing the project which they take on and complete it. The extension from 17 to 24 months is good for all students. It provides more hands on time for students to work in their fields and gain deeper insights. A masters student is well trained during the course of his study and few students excel in their fields during the course of study. When a masters student is ready to work, he can learn on his own and implement new methods. Hence, I feel that the employer does not need to show that they have the resources to train students. Myself being an undergraduate in Computer Science, already worked on quite  a few projects and gained industry level experience during the course of study and now that I'm a Masters student, I can learn more things and implement them with out being trained by someone. The paperwork is a burden to the employer, student and the DSO which might put the employers in a dilemma whether to hire or not to hire a STEM OPT student. The proposed rule is good in all the aspects except for the paper work, training and mentorship program. The new rule should be implemented with the 24 month extension, reduced paper work, with out the mentoring and training program.

I wanted to highlight how the stem opt extension personally played an important role in my life. I currently work for a private corporation after finishing my Ph.D. In biomedical engineering. I do R&D of medical devices used in diagnostic and treatment of lung cancer. The products I develop helps millions of people across the world including American citizens. \n\nMedical devices is a highly regulated industry and often it takes couple of years to successfully launch a product. Thereby the proposed extension will allow people like me to stay longer and get the practical training on successfully launching products in the market.  Also, most development projects are done on a yearly basis. So extending the opt to 24 months helps people like to me to stay for 3 complete physical years, rather than leaving a project in the middle of development. \n\nAlso, I want to emphasize the positive impact, students on opt like me bring to American economy. Personally, I am responsible for brining 2 projects to my company in US, which are traditionally done in our company headquarters in Japan. This lead our company to hire 2 additional people to support the projects. Also, these additional projects prevented one of our contract companies in US going defunct. \n\nI also want the proposed rule to allow students who have entered their 60 day grace period to take advantage of the proposed extension. Roughly, 18000 students are already in STEM extension and it is unfair to a fraction of them to miss out the chance to get the remaining 7 months because of the regulatory time involved in publishing a final rule. If the final rule takes into effect on Feb 15, students whose 17 month extension ends on that date cannot take advantage of this rule because it will be nearly impossible to get all the required documents approved by the end of their extension. Therefore I urge the DHS to consider including the students in their 60 day grace period. \n\nIn summary, I personally benefitted from the STEM extension. The training I obtained after my graduation, helped to gain necessary experience and confidence that I can use to work in any part of the world. \n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2282","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sujeeth Parthiban"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My company (Cvent) regularly hires foreign nationals for technology positions and we are very much in support of the proposed new rule.  First, I want to clearly state that our immigration policy encourages us to hire US citizens unless none are available to fulfill the roles we need to fill.  In other words, we do not have a preference for hiring foreign nationals over US citizens, we simply cannot find enough qualified US citizens with the necessary skills to fuel our company's growth.\n\nWe have an active college intern program and like to hire interns when they finish school as we feel that it's a good way to partner with the academic community and enrich our own applicant pool.  If the government does not raise the cap on H-1B visas, it is imperative that we extend the length of the STEM program.  If we don't take any action, we risk losing talented employees simply because they cannot find a path to work authorization within the parameters of the existing laws.  Worse, we've had several cases where employees' jobs have been disrupted due to the expiration of their STEM when they weren't picked in the lottery.  We have had two such cases this year where employees were out of work for weeks at a time, while they waited to enter a master's program and come back to work for us under the CPT program.  These situations take a toll on the employee and on our company as we're forced to plan around these unanticipated staffing changes.  If the STEM program extended to 24 months, they would have yet another opportunity to compete for an H-1B in the lottery.  I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly disruptive these breaks in employment are to all concerned.  There has to be a better way.\n\nThe only other way to abate this crisis is to invest in skill training for American citizens so that we can more easily find qualified applicants on home soil.  Cvent supports these initiatives too and we actively partner with local schools and vocational training programs.  But our company is growing too fast for this talent pool to keep up.  In the space of 2 years, we have more than doubled in size and created many, many new jobs for US citizens and foreign nationals alike.  Provided that we can continue to find the talent we need, we only anticipate that our growth will continue.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2547","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Amy Gulati"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"What are the benefits of extending OPT for STEM?

Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT.

Some of them may become the future Einstein, Von Karman, and other thousands of thousands of who can make great contributions to the United States. OPT 24-month STEM extension will dramatically increase the chance to keep those smart brains in this country. And US will benefit from this rule in the long run.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1881","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Albert Dong, Apple Inc"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think the new OPT extension rule is intended to benefit the economy and technology development in U.S. The OPT helps companies to find great employees all over the world and these foreign people bring diverse culture into U.S. If we can extend the OPT, it will definitely give tech company more chance to find suitable employee, and decrease the risk that great foreign employee may get lost because of the visa issue.

Also, the provision for extending F-1 status and any current employment authorization until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1 B visa has been requested is necessary for students and employees to maintain a valid work authorization status while they wait for their H1-B.\n\nThe STEM extension is essential because students gain valuable practical knowledge that supplements the knowledge that they gained from their academics. Often times the practical knowledge gained from 12 month OPT period is not enough to gain sufficient functional knowledge. Hence the proposed 24 month OPT extension is required so that students are able to complete their training, projects research etc and are ready to excel in their field.\n\nThe rule also guards agains the adverse effects on U.S. Workers. The rule mandates that the employer who is employing someone with a STEM extension would not lay off or terminate the employment of a U.S. worker due to the employment of the foreign national. It also makes provisions that the employer would have duties, hours and compensation commensurate with that a similarly placed U.S. worker. This would ensure that there are no adverse effects on the jobs of U.S. national as a result of this rule. Also, it mandates that the employer has work that further the knowledge gained by the student. This would ensure and cut down on the number of illegally working foreign nationals. \n\nThe rule correctly recognizes the effect of foreign students on the U.S. economy. Students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in 2013-2014 academic year. Foreign students specifically result in a huge benefit for the public colleges and universities in terms of the tuition paid as compared to in-state students.\n\nThe rule correctly recognizes that by earning a functional understanding of how to apply their knowledge in a work setting, students would be better positioned to excel in their field of work. As previously noted, the STEm extension would give sufficient time to students to complete their research, projects, tasks etc and gain a comprehensive knowledge as required by STEM courses. \n\nThe rule has correctly identified that the percentage of foreign students has been declining while that of globally competitive countries like Canada has been increasing. The proposed rule would help U.S. to remain globally competitive and attract the best talent from the world over. The rule has a huge impact as there are more than 34,000 students that are in US. as of September 15,2015. Hence, the fact that rule is brought in effect is extremely important.\n\nThe comments for the specific sections as requested by DHS are as follows:\n\n1. Length of research, development, testing and other projects for which STEm graduates from U.S. universities are typically assigned in the workplace:- As previously noted the length of the research projects etc. are often more than  the OPT period of 12 months. Hence, the proposed rule of an OPT extension is required so that students gain a strong functional and practical knowledge in their field of study. The ability to complete their training and functional application of their knowledge would also serve as a incentive to students who are planning to begin their study in U.S. and ensure that the U.S. universities and colleges remain competitive globally.\n\n2. Proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension and the ability for qualifying students to receive an additional such OPT extension based on a second STEm degree:- As previously noted the proposed 24 month OPT extension is essential for both foreign students and U.S. economy. Also it safeguards the interests of U.S. workers. I feel that an additional OPT extension based on a second STEM degree is also essential as often time the second degree is different from the previous one and a additional STEM would be required.\n\n3. Proposed transition procedures and alternatives to the potential courses of action:- I feel that DHS has correctly identified all the transition procedures and alternative and may take any one that it deems fit, in case need arises.\n\n4. Academic benefit of the STEM extension and the changes to the structure of list:- Specifically to students graduating from MIS programs, a sound functional and practical knowledge is essential so that they remain competitive in their field of work. i am sure that it is the case with other degree too.  DHS to take steps whatever necessary\n\n5. Imposing a firm accreditation :- I feel that DHS is better positioned to take a decision on this. \n\n6. Agency's estimate of the burden of collection of information:- I feel that the agency has rightly taken all the factors into consideration and come to a correct estimate.\n\n7. Minimize the burden of collection of information:- DHS may take steps that it deems fir in this regard.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1673","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Mohit Krishna"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This does not protect Americans.\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3289","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Edward Mitchell"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support Stem Extension OPT rule for 24 months as students in this field are highly talented and skilled from all parts of the world.

No foreign student goes to the employer and compel them to  provide a job showing the fake resume. If a student provides fake experience, they suffer a lot to work up to the expectations and the employers have the freedom to fire the candidate as well.

It will solve any issues which were addressed by some people opposing the STEM extension. \n\nConsidering few issues and blaming all the international students will definitely create a roadblock for prosperity and growth of students as well as the US Economy.

It's such a boon for STEM OPT students, especially when the chance of winning H1b lottery is getting tremendously lower over the years. Moreover, it helps to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the US tech industries.\n\nHowever, I believe the E-verify requirement associated with the new rules should be removed. It unfairly limits job options for STEM OPT students, as there are still plenty of major companies not willing to participate in the E-verify program. And with the new rules such as the New Mentoring and Training Plan, wage and compliance requirements that serve to more closely oversee the OPT extension program, the E-verify requirement is also becoming less and less important.\n\nIt seems to me the E-verify requirement in OPT regulations is more of an incentive USCIS offers to tempt more employers to enroll in it, while it turns out to be a burden for both STEM OPT students and employers. Personally, I've been suffering from that as a student on OPT extension.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1816","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Qi Zhang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an international student currently enrolled in a PHD program.

I agree with this not just because I am an F-1 STEM student who will be affected by this, but also on the well-being and goodness of the US people and companies. \n\nA country can never be booming up in the economy as well controlling well on the CPI index to avoid the price going to high. But these years US government has done well in this. You may argue it is the result of the low interest rates. Come on, it is just a few years after the financial crisis, many firms got broke down. If you know the market well, the technology firms as well as the technology itself contribute a lot to the not only firm wide but also the country wide recovery of the economy. And a really important factor is the STEM extension after 2008 which allow more technology and science related students to have more time to chase their dreams as well as contributing to the US economy as well as the firms. So it will not be surprised that many tech firms including Facebook, Google and Airbnb, are still keeping expanding the number of the international employees even they are so big now. Beyond that, for many firms other than the tech field, they are quite eager to get the tech-background people to make the firm work more efficiently, for instance, the tech side in the finance world or other industries. Yeah, you got it. There are still a gap between the need of the tech guys and the supply of them in US, and the former group is much much larger than the latter in job market.\n\nMore specifically, the STEM extension will contribute to the firms in US or some international companies who have branches in US. And not surprisingly, the firm appreciates more than the employees like us. As I have many friends related to STEM background and as far as I know, for tech people, for no matter what industry, they are in need in each country. Even US would not give the opportunity for working, they can go to Europe or Asia to find a successful localized company to know more and contribute more. Also, if the STEM extension will not be passed, there will be less people going to US to chase expensive education in STEM. All these factors will definitely hurt the tech firms or the firms who have tech positions.\n\nSo from the well being and benefits of both the US economy and the STEM related students, I really agree and urge the STEM extension will be confirmed as soon as possible.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2692","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Enze Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1513","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jiahong Guo"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am strongly against this.

Occasionally, I see some worries regarding the impact of this rule to U.S. born STEM workers. \n\nIn my opinion, these worries are unfounded.\n\nI work for a public tech company. Our company promised the STEM graduates, mostly highly skilled Ph.D. degree holders, who are affect by the Aug WashTech ruling, to keep the same position and relocate to our Canada office. The reason is simple: the cost of replacing them is too high. \n\nI believe that similar arrangements will be made in other tech companies as well. In most STEM fields, the employees can work remotely. And most of STEM employers are international companies with oversea offices. The vacation of the OPT STEM extension will not necessarily mean that these jobs will go to U.S. born STEM workers, but rather rob this country of these young, high-earning, tax-paying,highly skilled workers (who will still hold these jobs) but live in a foreign country.\n\nThe argument that the companies hire international STEM majors because they are cheaper also doesn't have any supporting evidence. In fact, in most tech company's recruitment workflow, the party who makes the hiring decision (the tech lead or manager) and the party who negotiate salary (the HR) work separately. When the hiring decision is made, the salary negotiation hasn't started yet. It is impossible to discriminate against U.S. born STEM majors due to salary differences.\n\nIt will be beneficial, rather than harmful, to U.S. born STEM workers if we are able to attract highly skilled international STEM majors to stay in U.S. The main complaint against this rule is the U.S. born STEM workers' fear of competition. However, it is the rule of the market that improvements and innovation stem from competition. The competition in technology will not go away just because the U.S. workers are fearful. It will instead happen in other countries, and create even more incentives for U.S. tech companies to establish oversea centers and to outsource. The biggest beneficiaries of the Aug WashTech ruling would be China and India.\n\nIn addition, the Aug WashTech ruling is particularly unfair for the STEM major students graduated from 2013 to 2015. Upon graduation, they planned their living arrangements and career based on the STEM extension policy. The sudden change of the ruling invalidates their prior plannings, which can easily result in tens of thousands dollars of additional costs for them.\n\nPassing this new rule as is, will be a win-win for both the US and the US STEM workers. \n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2614","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I object to this proposal - my son just graduated in computer science, and is finding difficulty obtaining a job.

I am a U.S. citizen and have a BA Physics and BS EE and so far a 30 yr career.  In that time my opportunities have been curtailed by foreign worker visa programs. I have standing to bring suit against the know-nothing government, but not the standing required and it would be a waste of time. \n\n2. I just spent $4,700 of my own money for practical training because the State programs (Workforce Dev. & WOIA) are utterly useless for that purpose.  My training was to shift my skills to an in-demand area that I have some experience in.  The OPT program should be directed at U.S. citizens only.  What part of this is too logical to understand?  \n\n3. You have ample evidence of the insanity of the immigration reality in all respects, including findings on OPT from other commenters.  I have a few below.... You can see that the White House simply ignores negative findings about the program and doesn't respond to Congress.  \n\n ______  Supporting facts  ______\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff, UC Davis:\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n\n----\nIan Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute:\n\n\"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.\"\n\n\"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\n\n----\nDaniel Costa, of the Economic Policy Institute:\n\nthe worker protections included in the new rule \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.\"\n\n----\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n--------\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\nThe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n------\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3850","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by John Lipsius"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"STEM degrees are very important to the US society since the development of economy relies much on these degrees.

The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., illegally, and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, IN VIOLATION OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT.\"\n\nThe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"  The proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nLARGE COMPANIES can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- much cheaper, than the Americans they replace. \"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recrui ts will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\" Because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\nIT IS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS COUNTY WHO BY THE WAY GETS PAID BY TAX DOLLARS CONTRIBUTED BY AMERICAN CITIZENS PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY.  THIS PROPOSED RULE IS A TRAVESTY AND TOTALLY UNNEEDED AND IT COSTS TAXPAYERS WHO PAY YOUR SALARY BILLIONS.\n\nHopefully one day we will be able to get a President in this country who will cut your jobs and your salaries so you will not be able to propose any more of these ridiculous rules.\nThanks very much.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3366","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Twyla Tranfaglia"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Excellent idea.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0738","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Koushik Ram Kunathur Thikshaja"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I wholeheartedly support this proposal because I believe immigrants that have received higher education in this country, especially STEM majors, contribute significantly to the US economy and the tax revenues, help create jobs and advance technology development. The current cap on H1B visas is hurting the economy and technology development by pushing talents away. Many fresh graduates with PhD degrees leave the country and work elsewhere, not because they are not good enough for the US, not because they are not badly needed in the industry here, but simply because the odds are against them. \n\nMany argue that foreign workers will steal our jobs, which is simply not true. An overwhelming majority of these foreign workers are working in the industries where we don't have enough domestic supplies in the first place (simply check the number of domestic students who earned advanced degrees in Engineering, as opposed to the number of job openings in relevant field each year). Also relevant is the fact the unemployment rate for American STEM majors with advanced degrees is very low, compared to the national average. This strongly suggests that STEM major immigrants are not going to take our jobs.\n\nHaving a 24 month extension would definitely help ease the current situation, as that'll give foreign workers a longer period to work for US companies and contribute to the US economy. For these reasons, I support the proposal for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees to get a 24 month extension, and for all students to get a cap gap relief.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0405","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Vera Zu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is great!

Because India is one of the most corrupt countries and the bureaucracy is so corrupt, bribing and lying and cheating is very common in India.

If you examine any Indian 's documents you will find in a majority of them there is something fishy. And on the job front, many American companies have gotten rid of AMerican employees and replaced them with college graduates from India. FIdelity Investments, HP, Microsoft all indulge in these nefarious activities where genuine Americans are laid off from work and replaced with these foreigners. I personally know of many american IT workers who have lost their jobs and unemployed while being replaced by foreign workers.

As a STEM graduate, I noticed that my STEM program has been historically dominated by international students, due to the academic rigor and the quantitative skills required in accepting candidates. Giving permissions to international students to work in the United States will not only help them attain relevant experiences, but also help their STEM programs flourish and reinforce the industry-needed skill sets in classrooms. \n\nThe proposal will benefit the U.S. economy because some technical firms would not have a sufficiently large pool of talents to grow businesses if foreign nationals are excluded. Although we see some U.S. citizens that are great at technical skills, the scale of such talents is much smaller when compared to that of international graduates.\n\nOne additional benefit of this proposal for international graduates is, obviously, the extended period to work in the United States. As an applicant who filed for a H1-B petition this year but failed in the lottery, I know that there is preponderance of evidence where a firm files multiple petitions for an employee or a working professional files multiple petitions with different employers in the H1-B lottery process. This significantly lowers the probability of an applicant (who only files for one petition with his/her current employer) to be selected in the lottery. There are even some IT firms that tend to increase the H1B pass rate for employees in numerous ways, but they do this at the cost of the applicants who work for them--the pay is generally lower, which has an unintended consequence to the job market and creates a financial edge for these employers.Therefore, having the proposal approved would help rebuild the level field in the H1B lottery and brings back fairness to international hires in the job market. \n\nIn summary, the new OPT extension proposal is a policy that is beneficial to both the U.S. economy and educational systems. Equally important is that it infuses integrity and fairness to the H1B lottery.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1491","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Linan Bi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am totally against this plan:   \"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.\"\n\n\"a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.\"\n\n\"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\"\n\nPlease ensure that my grandchildren will have the first choice at employment in the US when they finish their college educations.  \n\nSTOP all this immediately and PROTECT our jobs and future.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3064","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sharon Dotson"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is profound contentment to witness the hard work and sincerity of DHS and United States Government to offer a best education and equal carrier opportunities to the world students irrespective of any physical and geographical inequalities.

Allowing corporations to take advantage of a loophole that is detrimental to the American people should be closed.\n\n The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. \nIn short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any  who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition..I'm fuming to learn while OPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is no-ones definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months. \nThe OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program. This is known as pre-completion OPT, \nAs admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B.\n Thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. \nClearly, this regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end run around existing laws. It's an employment program for and only for foreign students This is unbelievable.\n (U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.}\n\nSafe guards must be implemented to protect the American Worker now!!!\n\nAMERICA FOR AMERICANS FIRST!!\n\nEMPLOYERS MUST SET UP MENTORING OR CO-OP PROGRAMS WITH LARGER PERCENTAGE OF US STUDENTS THAN FOREIGN BORN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM.\n\nHomeland Security lacks the resources to track these students after their visas expires. Is the FBI capable of doing the background checks for all applicants? These are important issues that are not considered under these Regulations.\n\n  ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3707","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by James Parker"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" This is just another way of getting cheap labor to drive down wages and increase profits.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3165","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Percy Mervyn"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I totally agree. it makes the it industry develop well and serve the society.

Most obvious thing - If an international student and a US citizen file a job application with similar skills, the US citizen will be given priority. So there is no point of worrying about the jobs here. More over the international students are looking fro jobs in STEM field and there are plenty other fields where US citizens can look for jobs. \n\nAlso we are paying too much tuition fees as well. If only three universities provide funding to international students, it doesn't mean that everyone is getting free education here.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. This fact alone has a huge detrimental impact on a system that is going broke potentially expediting the failure of a program millions of retired Americans depend on for their livelihood. OPT is nothing more than an end run around the immigration laws set forth by congress to increase H1b visas to the detriment of the American worker.\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3523","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by John Niemi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This policy will help increase economy of U.S since it keeps intelligent people around world to contribute to Technology industry of America.\nStrongly support extending OPT!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Bo Gong"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There should be some flexibility for students who have acquired a second STEM degree at the same level.

We all know that some of the developing counties like China and India are eager to have educated employees to keep in pace with US.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; \n\n2. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n\nRichard Trumpka, President AFL/CIO has presented the following facts about the program:\n\n\"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out ! of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department is on record stating the follwing: \n\n\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has! nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\n\n\nThe 911 Terrorist would qualify under this regulation. America and U.S. workers will suffer greatly.

In addition, people at the workplace are highly motivated and guide and support me in my responsibilities.\n\nI feel the new proposal of 24 months is a bonus in getting to have a good feel and gaining in-depth experience.

If I were in their shoes, I would be like to say, I would not feel the same. However, this reminds me of a book I read a couple of years back called The World is Flat by Thomas Friedman. In this he states that in the long term, moving jobs to more competitive parts of the world gives the incentive to the workforce losing it to step up in the technology chain of value added. True, in the shorter term there are layoffs and the associated misery. but history has proven otherwise.\n\nThe new guideline for Companies to match the pay of students in STEM extension has as much to do with equality as is to do with protecting American jobs. Gone will be the days of selecting an inexperienced student quick to learn, at half the pay over another more experienced one.

This program creates indentured servants that drive wages down for American citizens and destroys working conditions for all people in America with a job.\n\nIndentured servants are individuals that do not have full rights, full protections, or capability to switch jobs as compared to US citizens/green card holders.  These indentured servants work at low rates, more than 40 hours per week, but only bill for 40 and take a ton of abuse from the hiring managers.  Having more than one class of employee in America hurts Americas and those American owned businesses who are more concerned with employing Americans than lowering costs by using non-American employees.\n\nThis program has similar negative effects as the horrible H1b program.  Indian owned companies have repeatedly sent me emails regarding open positions that specify that any candidates that I send them have to be H1b, and sometimes require only candidates on this program.  I can forward these emails to you.  This is unfair to every American, but mostly to the historically disadvantaged minorities in American as the hiring company can claim to have hired a \"minority\" for this position by hiring a non-American.  This program and the H1b program hurt African Americans the most!\n\nThis program is actually worse than the H1b program.  There are zero salary protections for people on this program, so the staffing industry can and do fully abuse them.\n\nWhy are non-Americans even allowed to comment on this legislation?  Aren't the laws and programs in America supposed to benefit Americans?  Do we make laws that determine which part of America to give away to other countries?  Is that who we are?\n\nI have personally hired five underemployed or unemployed Americans of various races and trained them to start their IT professional career.  Without the eradication of these programs, I will be unable to do this in the future as my cost to do this is the same or more than the total cost for my clients to bring in H1bs or candidates on this program.\n\nThis program is killing American jobs.  In fact, there are already too many non-American STEM candidates in America.  Every single day, I receive emails for placement firms' hotlist of available candidates.  There are hundreds of non-Americans in America currently unemployed.  Why are we adding more to directly compete with Americans?  If there is such a need for STEM trained employees in American, why have billing rates gone from over $150 per hour in the 1990s to under $50 per hour now for an expert?  On top of this, clients stopped paying for travel during this time period as well.\n\nMost companies now have an \"India first\" policy when staffing for projects or positions.  This means that all positions and projects are funded low in the expectation of staffing with H1b candidates or candidates on this program.  These companies all have H1b dependent vendors.  They try to source all staffing through these firms in order to get low rates.  This means that no Americans get these jobs due to these H1b dependent firms' racist preference for Indian employees.  I have never once seen an Indian employ an African American.  This program is essentially an unlimited source of additional candidates for these H1b dependent firms.\n\nI am an American Citizen.  I have worked hard the last 20 years to build my career and my company.  Please don't take that away from me.  Please provide Relief for Americans - end this program now.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2487","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Dana Showers"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I agree with the expansion of opt time to 24 months for STEM student.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1193","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ruihao Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPT does not need to be expanded.

But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:\n\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\nRon Hira of Howard University: \n\"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional.

This will simply increase the incentive companies have to hire and keep foreign students rather than consider US citizens.\n\n  Foreign students are not required to make FICA payments and neither are their employers. They are essentially indentured servants with few choices regarding the conditions of their employment. These factors make them much more attractive vis a vis American STEM graduates. One of the reasons for low participation of US students in STEM areas is because many companies prefer to hire foreign students. There is not a shortage of STEM workers in the US, just a perverse incentive system for hiring foreigners, either under OPT or H-1B. \n\n  As a former high-tech employer I can tell you the process is a sham. This expansion will benefit the Chamber of Commerce and the 1% and will do nothing to help un-and-underemployed Americans.

International students are usually taking on the jobs that require years of accumulation in one area, which means a narrower career choice, if dismissed, in the future. Actually internationally students are taking the risk and doing the jobs that many of the United States citizens don't want to do or lack the skill to do. Therefore, the demand from companies do exist and it can not be substituted well only by local people. The US. economy consists of the companies. If they are doing well, the US. economy will do greatly. Since the logic is clear here, I request for the approval of this proposal.

STEM degree and jobs have been among the top luring subjects for international students to come to USA. The proposed rule to extend STEM OPT EXTENSION to 24-months will help both the students and the government. When higher education degrees are granted to other nationalities, offering jobs in the same country to put use the same valued education is the best bet for the right justice to the degree. \n\nApart from the 12-month initial OPT, getting a 24-months extension will help lot of students gain real world experience putting their degrees to the right use where they earned it. If the student decides to continue to apply the earned experience in the right channels that is within the US, applying for another work visa(H1B) would be much more feasible now. Few students struggle to get employed right after college and miss one opportunity to enter the lottery based H1B application system. Even with the most advanced degrees in the field, luck also plays a factor in getting a job or searching for the right opportunities. This 24-month extension will help students apply for H1B lottery twice(in some cases thrice) allowing them to cut down the fear of being out of status. Being unlucky does count in this sense.\n\nThe mentoring and training plan will also be a great initiative boosting employer-employee relationship in helping the company grow with the right talents. Advanced degrees are prominent in all fields now and people are leaving no stone unturned. Relevant experience also has its importance but an advanced degree provides better insight on wider growth. Releasing an official document with the participating list of companies willing to hire OPT and STEM OPT students will help majority of the students to align their interests in the right track to gain experience. Graduates with no corporate experience have a lot to gain with this training plan, where one gets to live and work in a real office with real projects and timelines for 3 years of work permit. If need be and the student decides to continue as a worker, they can apply for H1B visa or go for another advanced degree. Ability to chose another higher degree and work another 3 years on another OPT is again a stardom point in this proposed rule.\n\nI hope this proposed rule will increase the amount of full-time jobs in STEM fields, rather than the budget seeking, wavering contract jobs students are kind of forced into. If companies hire students out of college with higher degrees to be put to good use within the country it is a win-win for both of them. It would be great if the process of applying for the remaining term of extension for the already approved 17-month OPT EXTENSION be minimal and fee free. Least a student wants is to be keeping track of his immigration status when all they want is to work, gain experience and earn a daily living.

Those students, no doubt, are among the most excellent groups at their ages. They are the most potential human resources for America's industry, especially for the high-tech industry. Just taking a few minutes to go over the statistics on the employee's diversity in some big IT companies, you can easily find that more than 50%, even more employees in Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc are actually from other countries. and you can also count how many famous companies are actually set up by them. Those people, students today and can be great people tomorrow. The value of them cannot be estimated more.  America needs them!  \nHowever, if they cannot stay here to make contribution due to expiration of F-1 visa,  they have to go home. America will lose a lot of valuable human resources.

Take Silicon Valley as an example, F-1 students with STEM degrees can be found in almost every technology-related start-up and large company. These students work in core pieces in the companies and make incredible contributions to the industry. It would cause a huge loss for the Silicon Valley and the US economy in whole, if F-1 students with STEM degrees stop working for the hi-tech industry. \n\nAs the H-1b visa lottery became an obstacle for F-1 students with STEM degrees to stay in the US, we should come up new rules for them to continuous working in the US. With this OPT extension, those students can have more chance to get the H-1b visa, so they can stay in their current jobs and make more contributions. This will also protect and benefit those companies who employ F-1 students with STEM degrees. Moreover, this proposal will also encourage more foreign students to come to the US to study STEM majors, which will result in an income increasing for the colleges and universities. Also, as as the US government has put large amount of financial expenditure into the college education for foreign students, there is no reason to let those highly-educated students to leave the US. \n\nBased on the above reasons, I strongly support the proposal to extend OPT time to 24 months.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1376","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Kexin Yu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I highly support this rule and want to extend the OPT STEM Extension period from proposed 24 months to 36 months in addition to the original 12 month OPT Period so that students can come out of the H-1 loop.

Foreign STEM students are highly talented, just like all other US citizens, they pay FICA taxes, contribute to the sales of local grocery stores. A lot of U.S. companies that hired STEM students on OPT find that STEM students do an excellent job for the employer, in order to retain these talented employees, employers have to petition H1B visas for them. Due to the annual H1B cap, lots of these talented employees cannot get visa thus have to leave America - as well as the company, this definitely will create a huge financial loss to the companies who hire them - and ultimately, hurt the U.S. economy, with STEM extension, students that already have a job will have additional opportunities to secure an H1B visa, even they ultimately cannot stay in the U.S., the company and U.S. economy can benefit from their contribution.\n\nAlthough I support the overall STEM Extension rule proposed by DHS, I don't think the mentoring and training program is necessary. As STEM students are mostly employed as regular employees in the company, they are working in their fields as all other regular U.S. workers, it will be an unnecessary burden for companies to create such mentoring and training program, it may, however, also jeopardize their opportunity in the company.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0850","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Stanley Shen"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This rule will be a great step in improving the US economy.

The following are but a few. \n\nIII. Executive Summary\nA. Purpose of the Regulatory Action\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school  thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school.   Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.  \n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months, which is nobodys definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself  48 months is the course of study.  A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B  thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker  WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of [] employment.  Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students. \n[NOTE: U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.] \n\nG. Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields. \nTo guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. This is deceptive. The Regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S. worker. The Regulation deflect the issue away from  this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world.  Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers  with  no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student. \n \nThe Regulations define  similarly situated as \nU.S. workers in other employers [not other employees of the same employer] of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area [which will be strictly construed] of employment. Similarly situated U.S. workers would include U.S. workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the STEM OPT student.\nIn Short  By Definition There Are No Similarly Situated U.S. Workers Ensuring That No One Will Meet This Definition So The Employer Can Never Be Liable For Replacing Any U.S. Worker.\n\nIn addition an employer is to monitor and record his own actions by attestation in the Mentoring and Training Plan. This Regulation is designed to harm U.S. workers because it leaves the  FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE.]  The employer would also be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.\nThis Regulation is designed to leave the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers thus, giving the employer an excuse/alibi to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign student.  \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1394","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by James Otto"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Yes , I believe increasing the opt period will surely help the new graduates to explore more and and create something that's useful and very helpful to the coming generation.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2109","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Isha Bobra"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This good.

Just a few of the known issues are:\n\n   1. The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\n    2. There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\n    3. OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThis is in addition to the grossly unfair tax advantages enjoyed by firms hiring foreign workers and not paying FICA and Medicare taxes.  Yet, as DHS is aware, these workers will ultimately cost the US taxpayer billions in benefits.\n\nWhy DHS even considers such social-engineering as this is a mystery.  To enact these rules are utterly criminal and an affront to reason.  NO to these proposals.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3846","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Edward Henkle"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The rule now made is better for public.

As we know that in order to continue working in U.S. beyond the OPT time period, the internationals need to get approved with a H-1B visa through the USCIS lottery which has a notoriously high failing rate of 51%. Without the 24-month OPT extension, more than half of international STEM students will be forced to leave the job occupations in U.S. This will not only hurt millions of international STEM students every year, but will likely have a great negative impact on the U.S. colleges and universities, because prospect international student enrollment will be hindered. If they knew that the country that they are going to earn a degree in is not supportive for their career development after graduation, why would they come to earn a degree here paying the expensive tuitions?\n\nSecondly, without the 24-month extension, the U.S. employers would lose millions of well-educated, high-skilled international employees with STEM degrees. It would result in a complete waste of the employers hiring effort and expense, training resources, and most importantly, a great reduction on their talent pool. A huge impact on the overall company performance is likely to be seen, therefore result in a great reduction on their overall productivity and revenue.\n\nLast but not the least, the U.S. society in general will benefit greatly from this new regulation. Diversity and equality are two of the most important factors that make U.S. a strong and beautiful nation today. With open arms to embrace the highly educated, top talent from all over the world, U.S. society will undoubtedly benefit greatly in all aspects including economy, science, technology, and developing even faster to reach a greater goal. It is the great talent that propels the advancement of technology and economy throughout human history. With more and more supportive regulations to encourage the top talent to contribute in U.S. society, U.S. will fly towards a brighter future with strong wings.\n\nThanks so much for your concern and time.\n\nSincerely,\nLaurie Zhang\nGraduate Research Assistant\nUniversity of Washington","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0185","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Laurie Zhang, University of Washington"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe the OPT stem policy will be very helpful to American economy","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Martha Shi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the stem extention of 24 months ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1288","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Akash Goud"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Sir, it was a very good proposal for lakhs of F-1 students studying in USA.But according to our beloved president speech, we thought of proposal will be of 6 years just like H-1B visa holders.Please try to move at least  two years making the opt a total of 5 years.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0085","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Karteek Nadella"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe to altleast be with the previous rule as of 17 months of stem extension, as the international students are spending a lot of money over their studies and they will have only one H1B chance for lottery.

In particular, I strongly agree with the following provisions of the proposed rule:\n\n1.\tIncreasing the total period of the OPT STEM extension to 24 months. Students on a STEM extension are usually hired in specialty occupations. Training a new employee and entrusting them with responsibilities takes a substantial amount of time. If students are to contribute and gain real experience, a longer time period is necessary, and 24 months is appropriate to make a substantial impact, and kickstart a student's career.\n2.\tThe safeguards for US workers, and prevailing wage requirements alleviate concerns of STEM OPT students taking over jobs that would otherwise be obtained by US workers.\n3.\tThe mentoring and training plan requirements ensures that students will actually be employed by an employer that can provide the required guidance, training, and mentoring that they need during their early career phase.\n4.\tThe additional STEM extension is welcome news for students who are interested in working for a few years to gain practical experience before going back to school. The single OPT STEM extension per lifetime rule was overly restrictive, especially since many students go back to earn a higher degree level, and continue to contribute to the industry.\n5.\tSchool accreditation and site visits are crucial to ensure that students don't simply enroll in unaccredited schools with lax enrollment guidelines for the sole objective of obtaining work authorization.\n6.\tIncreasing the allowed period of unemployment to 150 days is a welcome relief, since the job search process is extremely stressful, unpredictable, and time consuming.\n\nThis rule provides substantial economic, academic, and cultural benefits to the United States, as specified in section IV. C. of the proposed rule. As stated in section IV. C. 2, it is important for the US to continue retaining high skilled foreign graduates ahead of other countries that may prove to be more viable destinations if the legal immigration system in the US proves to be too restrictive, cumbersome, or otherwise unfriendly to high skilled foreign graduates.\n\nWhile the rule makes some good proposals, we would also appreciate clarity on the following topics of contention:\n1.\tThe effects of a final rule not being in place by Feb. 13, 2016 on students who already have approved STEM extensions.\n2.\tWhether a higher degree in a non STEM field is grounds for a second 24 months STEM extension.\nFinally, I also suggest that students who have been on the OPT extension for a period of time be considered dual intent, and file for a green card without it having negative repercussions on future F1 visa applications.\n\nSincerely,\nAnurag Bhatt\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1913","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anurag Bhatt"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is past time for OUR government to have at least as much compassion and concern for our own citizens as we do for foreigners.\n\nThe following observations by Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis clearly state my opinion and beliefs regarding this program.\n\n1.

It's obvious you have never worked in the private sector, but do you not have friends, relatives or other contacts that do?  Do you not see our super high unemployment rate (the true rate, not the modified version put out by our current administration).  Do you not care about your fellow citizens?  Are you really that unpatriotic to support non-citizens over citizens?\n\nYou need to do one primary thing.  Establish laws that require employers to vet and select a US citizen for every job opening available.  If there is just one qualified individual against a hundred non-citizens, the citizen should get the job.

As a OPT Extension EAD card holder, I know what it means if my OPT is going to be revoked in Feb, 2016. As you can see, the H1B VISA is becoming harder and harder to win the draw and this rule for OPT Extension will give us more chance to try to get H1B VISA. I heard that some people are worried about if we international students are taking over the job opportunities. I don't think that is true because we are highly educated and as far as I know, most of international students who can find jobs, they are very talent and intelligent and hardworking. The more educated people work for US, the better economy US will gain. We all say that everyone is equal and free in US, so this rule only provides an equal opportunity for us to compete with others. It's not like this rule is providing every international student a job. It still all depends on each individual's ability to get a job. If you cannot get a job, even if OPT Extension is set to be 10 years, it still means nothing.\n\nFor myself, I cannot work anymore if the current OPT Extension expires in Feb, 2016. However, I talked to my company and they are very worried because it is not easy for them to hire another engineer to replace me because I have my master's and experience. Also, the place I'm working is a very small town. Not many young people will want to come and live here. Also, I've got my both bachelor's and master's in the US, I have gotten used to work with the US engineering system. It doesn't make sense to send me back to my home country and I need start over and learn everything again, which means I will use all the knowledge I've learned to strengthen my country so it can defeat the US? Therefore, if this rule cannot be approved. It's hurting me, my company as well as the US, very badly. Just think about how many contributions the international students are making for the United States, and you won't be even willing to give us a little more time to deal with the legal status so we can serve the US more? It's does not make sense to me.\n\nI truly hope that this rule can be approved.\n\nThanks.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0352","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Chunhui Song"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In general DHS have taken right step to overcome the bottleneck of current h1B visa issue.

While the classroom is very imperative to this practical teaching, it is still limited- as it is limited by its ONLY informative process. For this reason, a real life experience is pertinent. So OPT suffice in this regards. This is the reason many international students prefer the United states over other countries. As a student of Information systems, and into systems analysis and design, I have come to the realization that no effective system is built and implemented within a year. Upon graduation, an employer would prefer to have employee who can follow a project from start to end- in which case one year is not enough. Transfer of personnel has shown to affected IT systems design because of historical effect of most SDLC process. It leads to more cost of project implementation. In order to address this, I think the STEM OPT is imperative because it gives the \"Prospective\" student reason to come here to study. It also gives the graduate of STEM- who need more time- the opportunity to develop a complete training (classroom & real life). It gives Employers safe heaven and assurance of not training two staff for one role in a project which increases profit to the employer and in turn the economy. Finally, it causes an increase- or at least prevent decrease- in enrollment of international students in American schools who contribute to the school's income more than indigenous students.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1554","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Uche Amadi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"An integral part of the tremendous progress in research areas in the United States has been the integration of the  wavelengths of ideas and approaches from people from different parts of the world.

This is definitely a great rule and will benefit a lot!\n\n First, it is good for students, as they can apply what they learned to make contribution and convert knowledge into real value or economy for a longer time. What can you do in 12 months? Well you need to get familiar with the company, with your team, with the job, with tools they use, etc. You don't learn much and know much within this time and have to go back after. How will that be in an additional 24 months? You already know your stuff and is making contributions and gaining experience every day in this extension time! Also they will get deeper understanding on how Americans run their companies, create their new startups, and make great international businesses. These are potentially different ideas from what they know in their own country, and will help them manage their work life better in the future.\n\n Second, it is good for the society and the nation. Current OPT rule only allows foreign students to work for 12 months. What does US benefit from this? Companies have to recruit every year for new students and bring them on board, then send them away? But working for additional 24 months, on the other hand, create much value to the society and the nation. Think about how many foreign students are eager to learn latest technology from this country and how these elites can make a huge difference when they are working here for 3 years! They will help a lot for developing new technology, creating new innovative products, and bring new stuff to the whole society. How many foreign students does Google, Facebook and Apple have? And how are they rocking people's life every year?\n\n Last but not least, it is good for the business relationship between US and other countries. When these students go back to their country after OPT and extension, they will take all things they know about American business back. They will then become the bridge between businesses in US and other nations, improving international understanding and cooperation, help the growth of global economy. America will see more good stuff coming in, and sell more to others to make money (How would Uber go abroad easily without native hands in those nations? Could Apple use the same strategy from US in these other countries?). They will also spread American's good way in thinking, innovating and managing to apply in their own area.\n\n There are still other benefits that can be achieved with this extension rule, yet I already wrote a lot. As President Obama said once, America should not just educate these foreign students and simply send them back. This rule is a perfect chance for these elites to make difference and make contribution, just for this nation!\n\nThank you very much!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2010","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Chenguang Liu, Citrix Systems, Inc."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thanks for proposing this new OPT STEM rule which would benefit United States in the science & technology aspect.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0500","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Goutam Adwant"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Employers should be given incentives to employ American students first and disincentives to employ foreign students.\n  \nIf this country cannot provide sufficiently qualified students of its own then surely that tells the educators of this country they are not doing their duty!\n\nFurthermore a President who thinks he can introduce such a scheme and bypass not only 'We The People' but the students of 'We The People' has no business running the highest office in the land.

The STEM OPT Extension is primarily used by foreign \"nonimmigrant\" students that come in large numbers to the USA to pursue higher education in STEM areas. These students pay out-of-state fees here to go to school and thus bring in higher revenues to the universities here. Doing away with the STEM OPT Extension or even reducing it any lesser than what it originally was (17 months) may prevent these students from choosing USA as their choice of destination for STEM related higher education and thus decrease the revenue for the Universities here. This decrease in revenue is going to negatively impact teacher salaries, research grants, critical infrastructure development, etc.\n2. Most foreign students that pursue higher education in STEM areas, end up working for science and technology companies here in the USA. These students contribute towards growing these businesses which in turn helps the economy. These students also directly help the economy by paying taxes, social security, medicare and so on. Reducing the STEM OPT extension is going to negatively impact all these areas.\n3. From the history books of The United States of America, one can learn that USA became the largest economy and a world leader in many areas of science and technology because of the many invaluable contributions made by immigrants. Given this positive impact that immigrants have had in building this great country, it is only logical to continue to encourage students from other countries to come here to pursue higher education in STEM areas.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2876","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sundar Dev"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is absolutely moronic to support improving and expanding training opportunities for non-immigrant students.  four to six million students that graduated this year can not find jobs in the field of their choice.

Keep attracting the best and smartest students all over the world to study in a US university. Those students are not eligible for any student loan, all of them are paying expensive tuition fee, and out side state fee. those money either are from their home country or their family. Those cashflow will in return improve the resources (books, courses, programs) and benefit domestic students. \n2. This rule will help STEM students work in tech field after they graduate for a period, this further help them learn the skills required in an industrial environment. In the meantime, their productivity is beneficial to US economy. \n3. There are many tech startups, middle size companies that need passionate students who don't care salary the most but the impact and passion towards what they are working on. Usually, it's very difficult for them to hire experienced domestic workers because of the cost. In this case, 2 or 3 years of a passionate and smart fresh graduates will fit in and help the company survive and thrive and further benefit the economy. I don't think this will affect domestic STEM graduates because there is strict rules that companies should give priority to domestic workers. Usually, it's the case the company couldn't compete to get the skill set they need from domestic then hire internationals. \n4. International student workers are under strict rules and they pay a lot tax on time. This is also considered good to the economy. \n ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0379","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ting Song"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As international students, we need opt extension to find job, since it is more and more difficult to find a job.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1196","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Eric Lee"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Agree with this.

If there are training programs for foreign students, there can be training programs for Americans to do this tech work.  If there is such a \"need\" for tech workers, why can't an effort be made to fill this need with American workers, instead of changing regulations to fill the need with foreign workers who will work for lower wages.   If foreign workers are willing to work for lower wages, thus increasing profit for tech companies, how will they support themselves on less than a \"living-wage\"?  Will they be asking for entitlements, such as food stamps or housing assistance to meet their financial needs?  Will the American taxpayer thus be subsidizing the tech industry by supplementing the low wages the tech  industry hopes to pay foreign workers?  I do not support this proposed change in the H-1B Cap that would allow foreign workers to be classified as \"students\" to work for more than 12 months.

It also gives students enough time to evaluate whether they would like to continue to work in the US by seeking an immigration visa.

There are mainly three reasons. First, the graduated students with STEM degrees, especially those PhD degree holders, can make a lot of contribution to the economy and technology development of United States. These high educated group of people are the real talents that any countries hope to have and to employ. If US government does not allow their OPT extension, the US will lose too much. Especially, the US government has paid large amount of tuition (at least $20,ooo per year) for most of the PhD students by the research funding. If they can not continue to work in US, the government will totally lose these money. If these students go to the other countries, the US will lose more. Secondly, most of the projects in companies or in government can not be completed in only one year. If the employee with STEM degree has great performance on this project, but he/she has to stopped it, the company or the government has to recruit some other persons to replace the role of this great employee. Usually, it is hard to find someone who master the high-tech skills in a short time. Even if someone is found, the company will spend lots of money and time to re-train a new employee. I believe no company want to do like this. In order to keep the benefits of the company, especially those small high-tech start up companies, the US government should allow STEM degrees holder work for a longer time in US. Last but not the least, this rule will encourage more and more talents to come to US to contribute more to the society, otherwise, the US will lose its competitiveness to attract the talents.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0554","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is very much helpful for the foreign students which aid to enhance their skills in this real world.

The other's STEM OPT Extension is expiring very soon. They graduated from the best engineering schools in Italy and are very talented engineers.\n\nOn average, our company takes more than half a year to find a qualified person and trains him/her in the first half of the year. Their leaving causes big economic and time losses. \n\nI urge the DHS to approve the rule and put into effect at the earliest, and hope the DHS have some interim rule to help the students facing STEM OPT Extension about to expire.

The reason are as following.\n\nFirst, as we can see that a lot of high-tech companies like Twitter and Seagate are laying off employees due to cost reduction or merging/acquisition. It is more challenging for the new-grads with STEM degrees to find their first job. There are a lot of talented new-grads and one of the most critical factor that limits them is the visa status. If the OPT extension period could be expanded to 24 months, it is obviously of great help to the new-grads and the companies.\n\nSecond, since each year all the students with F-1 that hired by their employers need to be in the H-1 visa \"lottery\". This is another critical factor that limits the F-1 students. Some of them tried very hard to find a job and their employer likes them a lot. But due to they could not win the \"lottery\", they have to quit their job and go back home. That is a big lost for both the students and the companies. So if the OPT extension could be expanded, they could get at one more chance to win the \"lottery\".\n\nTo be concluded, I greatly support the proposal of expanding the OPT extension period to 24 months. This will definitely benefit both the students and companies.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1548","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Chenran Lei"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Firstly, I have to say expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees is good for both of the USA companies and international students!  Within the expanding training opportunity time, lots of STEM degree students will work for hundreds of American companies. They bring benefit for the companies and at the same time it's a good thing for the American's economic progress! Students can get more industry experience and provide American companies with workload and intelligence.\n\nOn the other hand, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students also means that study in the US is more attractive. More and more students will come to the US to get there degree because they know they can get more experience after their degree. In this case, American universities will be more attractive to international students compare with European universities. And this also can bring more money expense in the US.\n\nIn conclusion, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degree is necessary for both the US and the students.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1199","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Shifu Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strong agree with the 24 month opt extension.\nSince many of talents have to leave the company due to H1B issue and he company pay a lot of money on this, 24 month opt ext can give students one more chance of H1b lot.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0550","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Zaicheng Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I truely accept this proposal as it benefits many people on OPT with 24 months extension.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0333","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ritvik L."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to register my voice against DHS's amendment to F-1 non-immigrant student visa regulations.\n\nOur country is already hurting with so many unemployed who have gone in debt in STEM programs.

How you can you justify the following ??  \n\n\n The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3398","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Kenneth Cagle"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think the STEM extension for OPT should be increased to 36 months instead of 24 months as it'll increase the likelihood of USA getting a return on its investment of training the students in the best universities in the world.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0089","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Mass Mail Campaign 1: Comment Submitted by Nikhil D., Total as of 10/19/2015 (2)"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Opt extension is very important to improvement of American economy in current time.

On the other side, if the rule can not be passed, the sequence will be extremely terrible.Anyone can image that. \n\nFirst, international students come to US to pursue a high-level degrees since they are so smart and diligent and they want to bring new ideas and new fresh blood to US. This is why US is still the most developed country in this world. If US start to block smart and diligent people, I believe it is also the sign that United States starts to fall.\n\nSecond, international students bring huge direct economic benefit to US. US has the most famous and best universities in the world, but US has no enough students to fill up all the great universities and pay the high tuition. International students pay expensive tuition and living expense to support these famous universities in US. And most of them will leave United State after they finishing their education. So they are the perfect consumers who only bring a lot of money to US without selling any thing. If this rule became illegal, then students in other country would found that the US do not welcome international students. Lots of great US universities will start to fall and bankrupt. The consequence is extremely terrible. \n\nThird, competing is best way to inspire US citizens' work passion and keep US being the most developed country in this world. Everyone knows catfish effect, I know it has a lot pains and it seems bad. But the natural selection is alway the truth. International students all try their best to be an expert in their area and they just like catfishes who can spur the local students. And most of them will leave US after several years. So they will not actually rob job opportunities from American people, they are just completing some great projects and have some practice for US in their best years. Actually, most international students have some weakness in language and culture, so if the companies can find a qualified american citizen for the position, then international students will have no chance to beat american citizen due to the language and culture. International students can only find the jobs that have no qualified american candidates. If there is no international students to work for these companies, they may hire unqualified employees who may largely injure the competitive power of these companies, especially high-end technology companies. Also, if they have no chance to work for US, they have to go to other countries, and enhance the power of other countries. \n\n... there are many other reasons that this rule has to be passed, if people who can decide the result have enough foresight, they will pass this rule as soon as possible. \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0552","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Qing Lan, University Of Illinois at Chicago"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Very necessary to extend opt, otherwise lots of companies won't have people working in there","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0930","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Minglu Liu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Working or creating a startup in OPT duration is highly likely to enhance the business and economic thus bring more job opportunities to America. \n    Also students in STEM may create or support more research in different areas during OPT.

My research focused on developing membrane and adsorbent materials for CO2 capture to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, I am working at Honeywell in the Performance Materials Technology division using OPT. In my current role, I developed kinetic models for various technologies such as hydroprocessing and fluidized catalytic cracking to produce gasoline. \n\nForeign students represent half of all U.S. graduate enrollments in engineering, math, and computer science. There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Masters degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by extending the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees to longer period 24 months to get the new rule pass the law as soon as possible.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1558","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Fuyue  Li, Honeywell UOP"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think it is necessary for Internet Industry to keep OPT extension.\nFor some reason, the possibility for those talented guys to get H1b visa is not that high.

We know that most of STEM related positions were filled by international students, which means US still couldn't offer enough employees for these positions by US cities selves. If international students from STEM major couldn't lengthen their OPT, most of international students will have to leave US, and US job market will face the difficulties in looking for enough employees to fit the positions. As time going, it will lead to a week competition of US companies in global market, end up with a slower growing up. In the other side, if international students do know it is almost hard to have work chances for more than one year in US, many students may choose not to study in US, rather choosing other North American countries or European countries, which is also will give out a bad affect to US. I am a student of a Master program in Computer science, I can see that more and more international students are thinking out going back to their country right after their graduation because of the no extension policies. And more and even more other country students don't want to come for the hard situation to stay for more years.

In 2013, I came to the US to pursue Masters degree on computer science area. Two years later, I graduated with high GPA and high quality thesis. During those two years, I hold a graduate assistance position, which waived all my tuition (totally around 45k dollars). I never paid tax to this country before I came here. I enjoyed all free public facility, including free advanced education here for two years. Dont you think I own this country? Now I have a job, and this job is not only for making money for my family. I am well educated, smart and young. I pay tax, and work hard to create more value for my state, for this country (I am working with a state government). If you are a tax payer, do you want me to stay here for a longer time, or to go back to my county to make contribution over there? Yes, I do want to stay in this country, because the friendly people, good environment, good education for my kids here. But my staying is also benefit to my employer and this country. I was not luck enough to get H1b visa in last visa lottery. This new OPT STEM extension policy will help me to get more chance to win the lottery. So that I can pay more tax, make more contribution. Its a win-win result, isnt it?\nNow thousands of people are on the same boat with me.  You have two choices:\nOption number one: Young people come to this country; learn new technology and useful skills. When they are ready to work, send those tenants back. America is the most generous country; we educate people all over the world, and let them help their own country.\nOption number two: Young people come to this country; learn new technology and useful skills. When they are ready to work, let them stay in the US, serve this country.\nIts not about right or wrong, its about how tax payer in this country will think on this thing.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0101","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Miao Cao"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"STRONGLY SUPPORT to improve and expande Training Opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.

The immigration diversity helps this country attract a lot of top talent and it is also the reason that USA is and will keep the top 1 position in all the counties of world.\nAll of large successful industries,(for example, the spacecraft invention, the first landing on the moon, the internet technology, even the Hollywood movie industry and so on), are supported by a large group of obscure international people from STEM majors. For example, in lots of famous internet and technology companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple and so on, a large proportion of employees are international people.  These people lead the trend of technology and make a great fortune for USA.  They work hard in every industry & sector and contribute a lot to USA in their own way. They generate USA, and USA also generates them. This is why USA can continue attracting a lot of genius from world and remain its strong.\nAccording to statistics, the technology development in science and industry of USA in recent years is really in proportion to the increase of Tech immigration and international student number.  These international students study and master advanced technology skills in advanced universities of USA. Especially for those who have high level degrees, we have given them a lot of scholarship, we have spent a lot of money on them, so that we should give them more chances and let them make the most use of what they have learnt to contributes to USA. With their contribution, the technology and economy growth they produce will bring a lot of benefits. For example, more job opportunities will be created to USA. Besides, STEM students get things done, generate tax and pay social securities, which is also a kind of fiscal revenue for USA governments.\nNow a lot of companies can apply H1B visa for their international employees. However, unfortunately, there are still a lot of international graduate student cannot get H1B visa because of the limit number of H1B visa. These people have been trained at least one year in companies and have working experience. They have to go back to their homeland and use what they learned in USA to build their own country, which is really an enormous loss for USA. If USA can give these people OPT extension, they will have more chances to stay there and contribute to the development of USA. So, improving and expanding OPT will lead to a win-win situation. It has everything to gain and nothing to lose for USA.\nIn general, OPT extension brings lower cost and more resources for the technology companies. Next generation technologies will bring down the living cost for everyone and create more jobs for America! They are and will be making America greater! So, OPT extension is a good effort for USA to maintain our edge in science and technology.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Chen\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0455","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Alan Chen"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPT is a great program that enable a lot of very talented foreigners to work and contribute for United States.

Why is a US citizen at Disneyland working in IT losing his job to a foreign worker?\nThe whole immigration system is a failure and and a national security problem.\n\n\nImmigrants Arent the Only Ones Who Shouldnt Be Voting\nJULY 24, 2015  Ryan McMaken\n \n\nMuch of the current immigration debate in the United States centers around the issue of amnesty, which is a vague term that may mean anything from we wont deport you to lets fast-track you to citizenship and voting rights.\n\nFrom a laissez-faire perspective, the deportation aspect of amnesty  an increase in federal inaction  is one thing. The extension of voting privileges, though, is something else entirely.\n\nIndeed, the amnesty debate has helped to illustrate the difference between real, concrete property rights, and the much different political rights such as voting. Limiting property rights is always illegitimate. Limiting political rights, on the other hand, may sometimes be essential.\n\nProperty Rights vs. Political Rights\n\nFor example, everyone everywhere has property rights regardless of the type of regime they live under and whether or not the government recognizes the existence of those rights. These rights include the right to own ones own body, to own property peacefully acquired, and to enter into peaceful contracts with other people, including contracts involving employment and housing. The foreign nationals known as illegal immigrants also have these rights.\n\nBut property rights such as these should not be confused with political rights that are quite distinct from the right to self-ownership. In fact, in practice, political rights such as voting are often used to justify coercion against others in the form of expanding government spending, and government control over every aspect of daily life.\n\nCritics of amnesty who wish to further restrict the free use of property by employers, landlords, and laborers make a mistake when they try to limit immigration by restricting property rights. On the other hand, they are on more solid ground when they attempt to restrict the further expansion of government power by restricting the franchise and the number of people eligible (via citizenship) for government checks.\n\nThe assumption behind this position on immigrants is that new arrivals tend to seek an expansion of government benefits, and that they are net tax receivers who get more in tax benefits than they pay in. This is an empirical claim that may or may not be true. But, it is no doubt true that some immigrants are in fact net tax receivers, and it is in that direction that we should direct our attention.\n\nLimiting Government Size by Limiting the Vote\n\nIn making their arguments against expanding the vote to immigrants, the activists who hold this position place themselves among the few who are actually confronting the problem of widespread voting rights in a society where large numbers of net tax receivers also have the ability to vote further benefits for themselves.\n\nHowever, when we really start to examine the sheer number of voters who benefit from expansions in government spending, immigrants begin to look insignificant by comparison. The legions of government employees, government contractors, and Social Security recipients all know that any significant cuts in government spending would hurt them personally. And they vote.\n\nSo, if were going to take the position that those who benefit from tax funds should not vote, why limit ourselves to looking at immigrants?\n\nThe Net Taxpayers vs. the Net Tax Receivers\n\nIn his short book Bureaucracy, Ludwig von Mises examined this problem in the context of government employees. In a section titled The Bureaucrat as a Voter Mises explains:\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3535","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ernest Paviour"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Now I know for sure that our Administration (specifically DHS)is totally against We The People.

I'm sure you are smart enough to figure this out - or not?  My question is:  What benefits are you receiving?  You have to have a reasonable reason to be going after this - it sure isn't for the betterment of our US of A!!!\n\nIsn't this OPT, an added provision to H-1B, a violation of Congressional intent, discrimination, with no American graduates receiving the same benefits?  From what I'm reading DHT doesn't even know where thousands of foreign students are living and/or working in our country - bet they will turn up IF this OPT goes through!!!! causing more loss in taxes which should be coming in from legal American citizens.\n\nWhy are you not investing monies in our own students to attend community colleges or better yet, get our high schools to provide classroom training, use our STEM program properly?

and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3076","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Justin Steindorf"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't know what to say exactly.

While Section G of the Proposal extends protection to existing U.S. workers, i.e. prohibiting employers from replacing U.S. workers with F-1 students, there are no provisions that deter employers from hiring F-1 students instead of U.S. students. In other words, employers are not allowed to fire U.S. workers in order to hire F-1 students, but they are allowed to hire F-1 students instead of U.S. students even if there are qualified U.S. students want to work. Employers should only be allowed to hire F-1 students if there are no available qualified U.S. students. \n\nWe need to protect U.S. students who graduate with STEM degrees. U.S. students graduate in STEM and still don't find jobs. In the last seven years, they not only have been burdened by the recession but have also been burdened by the colossal influx of competition from foreign students caused by the expansion of the OPT and H1-B programs. Big Tech companies argue that there is a shortage in STEM labor. (One could infer if that there were a shortage of STEM labor, that U.S. students should have little trouble in finding jobs.) However, this alleged labor shortage is probably a myth. There are numerous recent articles that suggest there is a surplus of U.S. STEM labor rather than a shortage. For example, \"STEM Grads Are at a Loss\" by U.S. News & World Report and \"America Has More Trained STEM Graduates than STEM Job Openings\" by the Center for Immigration Studies both allude to the point I am making.\n\nMoreover, the proposal only makes reference to studies made in 2008 that suggest there is shortage in STEM labor (Section G par. 1). While those studies may have been accurate in 2008, they are outdated now.  Since the economic environment has changed substantially since the time of these studies,  a new and impartial study should be conducted in order to determine if there truly exists a STEM labor shortage, and we should conduct this study before making rules that change the OPT program.  If there is in fact a STEM labor surplus rather than a shortage and if it is true that a large portion U.S. students who graduate with STEM degrees cannot find jobs in their field following graduation, then extending the OPT program would certainly harm U.S. students. The bottom line is that we must first ensure that U.S. students have opportunities to learn from on-the-job training before we can become concerned with the needs of foreign students. Extending the OPT program now would be rash. We shouldn't jump to a decision without thoroughly understanding how the decision will impact U.S. students. \n\n\n\n\nIf anyone wishes to receive additional feedback from me, feel free to contact me the email address above.

The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThis rule creates a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. \n\nThe rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\n\nIn 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%. This proposed rule will exacerbate that diversity disparity.\n\nThe worker protections included in the new rule are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.\n\nThere is no need for this rule. There are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3543","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Marley Watkins"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Appreciate this move by DHS encouraging foreign STEM students by increasing their chances to get work experience in the United States.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2742","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jay Garaga"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the new rule.

I have to say this proposal is very good since it brings a lot benefits to the United States.  \n\nFirst, it can absorb more professional talents with STEM degrees to stay in the United States. They can contribute to America to be better and bring more productivity and values. As far as I know, every year there are a large amount of talents leaving from the United States, because they could not get H1B. That is huge losses for those companies where they are in and also losses for our America. If the Training Opportunities period can be extended, these talents will have more chances to get the H1B, which means they will have more opportunities to benefit this beautiful country.\n\nSecond, the extension of OPT can provide more powerful safeguards to industries in various fields to find more suitable talents and staff. For a company, it is not easy to find a very suitable employee. So with the expanding of OPT, American companies will gain more selection.\n\nThird, America is a country with a dream. She absorbs a large number of talents coming here to contribute to the country, since she never refuses people who have a dream. OPT extension gives international students more equal opportunities to realize their dream. That can also give those students more confidences to contribute the United States. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1840","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yu Zhang, Texas A&M University"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As an international student, I truly know how much this policy means to us: we can apply what we learn to practice and realize our self-values. But more importantly, this will also contribute to US in many different ways. So it's a win-win situation.\n\n1. Education: with longer OPT duration, a lot more international students will be attracted to America to seek further education. And as we know, the college tuition is a huge amount of money. This will definitely increase education incoming. And a lot of PhD students are sponsored by universities and governments, which means US government will suffer a huge loss if they are kicked out immediately after they graduated.\n\n2. Economy: those international students who can find a job are mostly extremely excellent elites in their fields, because they'll have to be much more outstanding to compete with US citizens. In lots of fields, there are serious shortages of talents and the employers always first consider US citizens. The reason why so many foreigners are working in those fields is they can't find enough Americans to work on it. If employers don't hire international students, these industries will absolutely crash.\n\n3. Progress: as an immigrant nation, America's success relies heavily on the contributions from elites from the whole world. Only with a healthy competing environment, this system will function normally. And also because of this competition, the human being is progressing gradually and our world becomes better and better.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yaoling Dong"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is ludicrous and borders on the insane to keep importing foreign laborers when millions of our Americans are out of work and can't even find a job.

Thanks to the OPT extension, employers can hire enough talent international students and have long time to sponsor H1B visa for them. Longer legal working period and more opportunity to apply for H1B visa produce result of less employee turnover, and thus saving money for companies. Also because more STEM students can stay in the US, companies can easily find their desired employees in such a various and sufficient market of employees. Only when companies do their business well that Americans can get lower unemployment rate and lead better lives.\n\nSome people worry that STEM OPT extension will harm native students and working Americans. There's no need to worry about that. First, American students take really small percentage of STEM students. Second, almost all companies prefer native students than international students. Only when the American students are not sufficient (because there are few STEM American students) for companies' needs that they start hiring international students.\n\nI suggest the government and American people approve the OPT extension for F-1 STEM students.

These policies were originally intended to attract the \"best and the brightest\" workers to the U.S. and augment our native workforce. Instead, they are being legally abused to import vast quantities of average workers who become de-facto indentured servants while they await green card approval.\n\nWhile the industry often claims that there is a shortage of STEM workers, it has been repeatedly documented that they are in fact looking for cheap workers* and intentionally avoid hiring qualified Americans. This cost savings is achieved by legally underpaying them and by hiring young, inexperienced people who displace older, more experienced workers. \n\nOur American STEM policy is deeply flawed as it encourages legal discrimination against American workers either through direct replacement or by hiring foreigners instead of Americans. Two companies involved in high profile tech worker replacement incidents in 2015 include Southern California Edison** and Disney***.\n\nThis policy will further erode the native American STEM workforce. In addition, it discourages our children from pursuing STEM careers as the career potential under such adverse conditions is highly unattractive. I strongly urge you to reject this proposal.\n\n\nFootnotes:\n*: http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/h1b.html\n**: http://www.computerworld.com/article/2879083/southern-california-edison-it-workers-beyond-furious-over-h-1b-replacements.html\n***: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/last-task-after-layoff-at-disney-train-foreign-replacements.html?_r=0","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2299","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous (R.

However, I'm disappointed by comments from many citizens who lack 'the big picture' and only see 'unfair' competition. Please read the following:\n\n\n* On immigration in general (it's not that simple):\n\n- http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy\n- Economists generally agree that immigration is beneficial, let alone high-skilled immigration which is generally considered as a 'no brainer'. Perhaps some individuals stand to lose but the economy overall is better off. (lengthy discussion here but that's the essence. do your research)\nNote that I'm not picking topics that simply advocate for liberal immigration policy\n\n\n* On attracting high-quality students (US gets the best):\n\nThe US (so far!) attracts some of the best talent the planet has to offer especially at the graduate STEM level. They are young, intelligent, full of energy, and many look forward to a permanent presence in the US. Sure, like any immigration benefit, it will be abused. Mediocre students are surely going to take advantage of this benefit. However, that is not an excuse to limit or eliminate the benefit.\n\n\n* Connecting with broader immigration reform (US does not accommodate the highly-skilled):\n\nThis regulation is another bandaid from the executive branch since Congress refuses to act on immigration reform. Perhaps there should be some provision to stop the STEM extension if foreign/alien/non-resident students are able to obtain a more appropriate work authorization once passed (?) by congress.\n\nOn the other hand, the US lets in some ONE MILLION people every year on a permanent basis. The vast majority came in on some family-sponsorship which is a relatively straight forward procedure. My point is that these (legally considered) immigrants did NOTHING to earn the privilege to come to the US. They do not face the red tape that US-educated, hard-working, and highly-skilled people go through (F1->F1-OPT->H1B->green card). \n\nAnd don't get me started on the talk about legalizing the 11 million undocumented/illegal immigrants.\n\n\n* My motivation in writing this (I might not even get initial OPT):\n\nI've accumulated a 17 year presence in the US on temporary visas spanning my childhood and into my adulthood. That's grades 1-6, a double major STEM BSc, most of a STEM PhD (exited with a MSc), and a second STEM MSc. Without much professional experience, I've gotten interest from employers working literally in the national interest of the US. Yet, as I finish my second MSc, USCIS my not give me the benefit of the doubt in my particular situation and issue me a second initial OPT period.\n\n\n* :\n\nAfter all this time, I do appreciate the chance to comment here as a 'foreigner'. Upon leaving the US, I will practically have no other professional avenue to come back with. But if feels great to leave my .02.\n\nSincerely,","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2897","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Majid al Dosari"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Great step by the homeland security department.

It benefits both United State economic and attracts more talented foreign students to study in US.\n\nFirst, as far as we notice that the recent years, the United States economy bloomed and will continue blooming because of those STEM people's contributions. For a long period of time, the development of United States rely on people come from other nations. Without them, the economic will be influenced. Imagine that one day those companies start to lose people, it will directly lead to a result of impact of leading position that most US companies have today. \n\nSecond, United States is a country of variety people. Each person came to US with their specific culture and idea contribute to the US society. Since creativity is the most important to most area of business. Extending the OPT can maintain and increase the variety of population, especially it will help to keep those who are better educated people continuing contributing to this country. \n\nThird, STEM majors are those \"hard\" major. It requires a lot of efforts to put into those fields of study. Therefore, students in STEM major are the smartest people all over the world. If OPT extension will be 24 months or even longer, then students will be more willing to study in universities of United States and try to find a job later. More research can be done by the brightest students. It will benefit universities and education institutions with less expenses.   \n\nOverall, the extension of OPT to 24 month will benefits United States a lot.

For example, in California there is countless high tech companies hire F-1 students using OPT extension. If these students are forced to leave California, who will do the jobs for these companies? American citizen who have the knowledge is far not enough to do these jobs. We need these F-1 students to do what native citizen cannot do. On the other side, these students will go back to the competitive country like Russia, China, India...people with high tech knowledge are so precious that we cannot lose.

I will first address the benefits of having the OPT STEM program and then point out many flaws in criticisms against it.\n\nOPT STEM program creates job and value-add for U.S. economy. There are approximately 900,000 international students studying in the U.S., and they pump $27 billion into the U.S. economy each years, supporting 350,000 American jobs. It is not uncommon for an overseas family to spend $100,000 or more per year for their child's college tuition and living expenses in America. Many of these students are attracted to U.S. universities not only because of the high education quality but also the prospects of working for U.S. firms for some time to learn the valuable skills that will benefit their long-term career goals. One year of OPT is apparently not enough to cultivate any meaningful experiences, especially for STEM fields whose research projects usually last for years. Not having the STEM option will make the whole U.S. education experience less attractive compared to other U.S. competitors who are aggressively attracting foreign talents such as Singapore, Germany, U.K. etc,...\n\nThe most important contribution of STEM students though are the new products and businesses they create after joining the workforce. According to a report by The New American Economy, 40% of the largest U.S. firms were founded by immigrants or first-generation immigrants, including many hottest tech startups. For example, Whatsapp, which sold to Facebook for $19 billion, was founded by a Ukrainian immigrant. In Silicon Valley, 50 percent of the tech companies, from Google to eBay, have an immigrant founder. 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child or an immigrant. For every 100 international STEM students who remain in the U.S. after graduation, 262 American jobs are created. \n\nCritics of the STEM OPT program have argued that STEM graduates accept lower pay, steal job and that there is no lack of demand for STEM workers. These claims are extremely ill-informed. First foreign STEM graduates usually work for high-tech firms and require much higher pay, especially those with Ph.D. degress. Second, there is higher risk to hire foreign STEM students and therefore the standards imposed on them are also higher. If they manage to get the jobs, you can't say that the jobs are stolen. The proposed rule also makes it clear that measures will be implements to ensure no lay-offs of American workers as a result of hiring foreign STEM graduates. Third, there is a lack of STEM talents in the U.S., period.  \n\nI would suggest that ICEB provides guidance regarding the cases of already-approved EAD's and strongly urge that it honors its commitments to these cases.\n\nReference:\nhttp://www.governing.com/gov-institute/voices/col-entrepreneurial-immigrants-international-students-community-development.html\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1508","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous (V.

After several years of education, if these talents, who will show their power in their area, cannot work in US only because of short legally work time, they will seek somewhere outside US that they can use what they learn in US. This is a huge loss of educated talents.\n\nThe skill of STEM major students need practical practice in the industries due to the sophisticated features of the profession. So longer legally working time in US is needed for talented aliens.\n\nThere is a say that employment of talented aliens leads to high unemployment rate of US. I don't think so. Since what I see is that in STEM major, at least in Electrical Engineering, more than 2/3 students are aliens. And STEM major student will seek job related to their major or they will not qualified for working visa. So there is less competition with local people. Thus there is no need to shorten the time for alien legally work in US.\n\nIf educated alien talents can find fit position in US, they can help company grow bigger and the US economy will grow, thus more opportunities are created for more than just STEM major area for other local people.\n\nIn all, the new 24-month extension for STEM major student is definitely a benefit for US. Educated alien  talents can use what they learn in US education system to benefit US economy and may create more job opportunities for others.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2041","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yuming Wei"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe this proposal is very meaningful for many companies hiring international students.

Based on my performance and skill set, I got a free ride for 7 years of my graduate school for both my Masters program and PhD. I am truly grateful for the opportunity and I would like to pay it back by contributing to the US economy. The OPT program is a mutually beneficial arrangement but due to the convoluted nature of the immigration process, the uncertainty during and after the OPT period adds a lot of stress to recent graduates like myself. \n\nI am a Mechanical Engineer and I am currently working as an Engineering Manager at a thermal solutions company. I am part of a changing business. The world is moving towards automation and many of the low skill, repetitive jobs are now being done by machines. The changing business models are putting high demand on high skill labor. The graduate schools are pumping out eligible high skill work force but current immigration regulations make it very difficult for an international student to find a job in industry that fits his/her skill set. Even with my Doctorate degree from a reputed school, I had to search for a job for nearly a year, primarily because of the fact that I am not a permanent resident. I interviewed for nearly 30 positions during that time where the employer was impressed with my resume and skill set but could not hire me because I am not a citizen or a permanent resident. It is discouraging to see that there is a huge demand in the market for someone like me but not enough pool of candidates for businesses to fill those positions due to immigration road blocks. \n\nExtending the OPT period is a first step in simplifying the process. EB1 category for applying for a green card is a good system for people who prefer to stay in academia and research. There is no equivalent category for individuals who would like to work in industry. Eventually, I believe that the pathway to citizenship should be simplified as well for eligible high skilled individuals who are working or planning on working in industry.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2250","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rahul Mulinti"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The stem extension is essential for both employers and students. Let's take an example of my own scenario. I graduated with PhD in Computer Science from the top research university working in the cancer treatment. Now, I am in my 12 month optional practical training working for a manufacturer that builds the software and hardware for the cancer treatment. It takes more than six months for me to understand the system. If there is no Stem extension, the employer loose all the investments and doesn't get any output.\n\nThe stem extension is needed to attract talents and grow the US economy. The US government has provided the scholarship to cover my educational expenses. I have developed a strong research and problem solving skills by working with the top scientist in the field. My skills will be crucial for the company to solve the innovative problems which will create new jobs and grow the US economy. However, I will be forced to leave the US if I can't acquire the work permit. In many scenarios, the employer can't secure a work permit because of the wait and processing time of the immigration matter. The stem extension provides the enough time so that the employer can secure a work visa and permanent residency for the qualified employee.\n\nThe stem extension provides an opportunity to qualified students to shine and immigrate to the US. It takes time for employer to know employee and realize the value of the employee for the company growth. It's almost impossible to demonstrate that value in 12 months, especially when you have to spend more than six months just to understand the system. The stem extension provides the enough time for students to show their potential without worrying too much about the future.

As a tax paying American citizen, I object to the expansion of this program.  I can see the rationale of giving foreign students the opportunity to apply the training they have acquired at U.S. institutions of higher learning so that our nation may profit from the investment made into these students' lives.  What is extremely objectionable to me is that it is being used to hinder American citizens who have paid dearly for training believing that they would find jobs in the U.S. to offset the cost of their education and enable them to provide livelihood for themselves and their families, keeping them off welfare and other assistance programs that drain resources from the tax paying citizens of this nation.  I have seen statistics showing that in a four year period, over 400,000 American citizens have been denied jobs in favor of hiring foreign students under the OPT program.  That is unconscionable!  Our first duty is to the needs of our own citizens, particularly in a time of severe economic downturn resulting in thousands of Americans being laid off work.  DHS is actually proposing to give financial incentives to employers who hire foreign students over Americans.  It should be the other way around in an environment in which Americans cannot even take care of their own financial responsibilities.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have also been informed that OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.  Should I say, \"STOLE MONEY DEPOSITED IN TRUST TO THE US TREASURY BY AMERICANS OVER THEIR YEARS OF HARD WORK TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR NEEDS WHEN THEY REACHED RETIREMENT AGE,\" The Social Security funds I have paid into are even being denied cost of living increases for the coming year. This is erroneously explained by a decrease in gas prices, when the truth is that money stolen from this fund are being used in part to fund a program which in no way benefits the people who gave into the system, It actually benefits people who have only received from our exceptional institutions of higher learning and now will be preferred for jobs over American citizens with the same or better qualifications.  \n\nThese are serious matters to every American citizen and must not be taken lightly.  The decision is ultimately in the hands of the DHS, but it is the moral responsibility of this department of a government \"OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE\" to consider the ramifications of such an act on the very people whose rights this nation's government has a responsibility to protect.  OPT, of itself, is a reasonable program as long as it doesn't inhibit the welfare of the citizens who support the government with their hard earned resources, but an expansion of this program can in no way be acceptable.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3441","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Valeta Bush"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support this rule, because this rule could attract more talented foreign student coming to the US, providing strong intellectual power for the US companies in various industries, such as IT, or health care.

The United States have recently stepped out of the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis, and we have seen the economy is getting stronger and booming since the beginning of 2015. More jobs have been added this year, and the unemployment level has been kept at a relatively low level compared to mid-crisis. This means that more Americans than that of mid-crisis era have jobs. There is still strong demand in the job market. This means that we can open up the opportunities to foreign students who study in the U.S. and have expertise. These students would fill in the positions which are left out of most Americans' interest. Most technology companies are built on technology immigrants, such as google, facebook and dropbox. Many of the modeling analysts in the big financial firms, data science firms are international students as well. We can see the success of these firms, and we can certainly infer that with the help of the international students, the U.S. economy would be booming as well. I almost think that the employment rate of Americans is positively affected by international students hired. Think about it, international students with high skill sets can help small business to grow and extend the life of the business, leading to more jobs available on the market. How many jobs has Silicone Valley created?\nIn comparison, Canada has a policy authorizing foreign students three years to work legally in Canada post-graduation to attract the talents. I do think United States should do the same thing to keep ahead in the global competition. \nHowever, I do feel a little concerned about the criterion that the employers need to meet to be able to extend OPT for international students. Some of them are not necessary and could be harmful. I think what we should fully understand is that neither OPT nor OPT extension guarantees a full time job, so just like the contract jobs, I don't think training/benefit package should be enforced here. International students working with OPT is like working on a contract job. They should be equipped with hands-on experience so that no additional training is needed.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2164","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Zhen Li"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"STAND UP FOR USA STEM WORKERS\n\n  the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n  \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT.

That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.\nOPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.\nBecause OPT workers are technically \"students,\" employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees.  That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.\nOPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.\nOPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.\nOPT expansion is overtly unfair to the foreign students in that they are not given raises and are forced  work for lower wages than other STEM graduates.  I have known many of these people and the first thing they do when they are green card eligible is to quit and apply for another job at double their current wage.  \nI have also noted that many of these graduates have absolutely no hands on skills.  They do not understand the basics of mechanics and how things work in the real world.  That is a very dangerous situation for the consumers of products they design and build. \nAlso, many of these students come from underdeveloped areas of the world.  It is unfair to their countries to remove them from service in those countries where their skills are needed to improve the quality of life there.  It is essentially a brain drain that keeps the said countries mired in poverty much longer than if they had the graduates that they most likely funded to attend college in the US.

It would help US continuously have a very good number of high quality international employees, who have been significantly contributing on the growth of economy (especially on high tech branch) in the States since years ago. Otherwise, the Companies would lose thousands of international employees next year, which would be a tremendous disaster for their operation and growth, especially for small business. Since there may not be enough qualified domestic candidates to hire in such a short time, as a result, not having this OPT extension may put the whole economy system in danger here in the States.\n\n2. United States of America, as we all know, is one of the most developed and most civilized countries in the world; not only because of  the right path those national fathers created a couple hundreds years ago, but also the spirits and values of this country Freedom, Justice and Diversity that built gradually generation by generation, which exactly is what their citizens are proud of. When I first came to the States, the director of the international office in my school, told me something like this: \"This country is strong as a thick rope, because she has been joined and being reinforced by high quality small ropes from different corners of the world. Therefore, we believe that the States will be as strong as they are with many high quality international components in the future.\n\n3. More working experiences for international students can be beneficial for both side: the students would get trained more and learn more skill before they head back their own country, which makes them more competitive to better contribute what they could and pursue what they are eager to for their life. On the other hand,  when they are back home, their \"USA\" working experiences can enhance business tie with USA when there is any business going on.\n\n4. With OPT extension, international student may be able to put what they have designed or developed into the market, create a startup, which may bring potential jobs in the near future.\n\nFor people like me,\n\nMy wife is currently an information architect at one of IT companies here in the States. Myself is a software engineer, just got my full time job offer and will start my work soon here. Without OPT extension, I only have one chance to try to win \"H1B lottery\"; if I am not getting it, I will lose my job after 12 months OPT. As a results, the whole burden will be put on my wife's shoulder to support the whole family, which will be too hard for her. Of course we can leave USA and head back home in that case, that way we both would have a job. But that decision can't not be made by myself, which is also too hard for both of us. Therefore, this OPT extension will be so important for us because with that, I may have 3 chances to get a H1B Visa. Also, a lot of things could be figured out with 24 more months.\n\nFrom my point of view, This OPT extension, will be surely beneficial for me, for people like me, but more importantly, for the whole country in both short and long run.\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2450","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Xiaoqin LI, Rice University"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully support the new Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students rule. \n\nAs we all know, United States has almost the most advanced and innovated technology in the world.

There are a lot of job opportunities that need people who are expert in programming, statistics and chemistry. As the company developing, The demand of these people is getting bigger and bigger. But not many people are interested in this area.  What's more, some foreign employee may lose their jobs because their visa status. What a shame, a developing company lose its people who may make big contribution to the company.\n\n   24 months is better than 17 months. Think about it, when people  are just getting familiar with their jobs and the company  think highly of  its employee. But 17 months comes, these people need to go. What a loss! \n\nI hope it will work. 24 months  extension is really a  wise decision. \n\nThanks \nEmma","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0903","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Emma Dong"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Do not expand the OPT program.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa wrote:\n\"The proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\"\n\nOPT is bad program that negatively effects American S.T.E.M. workers in favor of cheaper foreign workers.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3556","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Elise Evans"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am against this because OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

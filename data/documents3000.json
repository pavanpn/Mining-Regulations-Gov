OPT Extension to 24 months is necessary and benefit to US economy as well as the world's economy.There are three main reasons for why it is necessary and benefit.\n\n   First, international students plays an important part in the Computer Science industry market in US. I am an international student major in computer science in Stevens Institute of Technology.  What I have seen is most of our students in computer science department are Indian and Chinese. And my friends who are in Columbia University, King's Collage, UCLA, Northeast University and Seattle University see the same situation as I do. Those huge part of International students accepted US education, learn English and find jobs in US, they build 3D printers for constructions, create robots or machines for modern lives, build start ups to serve people,  producing cars, creating models of finance or bankings. Once they are illegal to stay in US, who could help continuing these valuable creations or innovations. And what should be doing to fulfill those gaps? Isn't it a lose of US economy?\n\n  Second, there are still a big shortage of computer science engineers for the technology industry. As I see in meet ups. Big companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, IBM, Apple and so on, still need  large quantity of engineers. even if Google has sixty thousand of employees, and Facebook has twenty thousands. Assuming that 10% of google employees have to go to their own countries annually, how many product lines should be killed? how to maintain their qualities and stabilities. The lost of engineers equals to lost of moneys in today's world. Further more, I could say it is US education who are better than any other countries attracting so many excellent students all over the world, isn't it a lost of talent for reduce the OPT extension?  \n\n  Finally, it is the poverty not wealthy people who want to immigrant to US. Most of international students can afford the tuition fees of US education. Those students are only in their 20's, they are too young to determine where to stay where to live not to say no parents no friend no relatives in US. To maintain a good education and have a sharp experience in their resume is good. 1 year is not enough to say in the resume. \n\n  All of the above, OPT extension have to be extent to 24 months. I strongly support this as a law.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0879","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jian Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I really appreciate the extension of another 7 months of OPT in the proposed system but the MTP(mentoring and training program) is the main drawback in the proposed system for students because top companies(especially, some of the fortune 500 companies) are already not showing interest in hiring F-1 students because of the requirement for the sponsorship. With this new rule, they might move a step backward in hiring F-1 students and even continuing them in the current positions they are working as it requires manager/lead/tech-help person to put some extra time for these employees to follow the process, setup the goals which may not be their interest. \n\nI completely understand the benefit of MTP for an F-1 student which helps the student to gain knowledge in their related field and keep them up to the speed but like I explained above it takes away the opportunity to get into a reputed well established organizations.

Students all over the world see the United States as the most technologically advanced society with the state of the art facilities and that is their motivation to choose this country for their educational pursuits. Yes, the educational system has given us everything, the laboratories here are well advanced taking our knowledge level to a new high. Knowledge, as it is, is like a seed but for the seed to grow, bloom, and finally to become the tallest tree it needs the right environment, needs constant nurturing and on the top of everything it needs to adapt. Universities and colleges here do an outstanding job sowing the seed but unless the seed sees the light of the day it has no opportunity to grow, it has no opportunity to show to this world what it can really do. The sunlight, I am talking about here is the industry exposure that a student needs to make the best use of his potential and to show that he too can make this world a better place to live. \nHence I fully support the better chance an International student gets with the new 24 month OPT extension.

The following are but a few. \n\n\nD. Mentoring and Training Plan\nThe Regulation does not care if the student is taught anything at all because the Regulation leaves it to the UNTRAINED employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for STEM OPT students.  The employer is in business  not education.  \nIt Is Noted That The Regulation Does Not Refute That The U.S. Has Plenty Of Home Grown Scholars And Stem Student. \nThe Regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign student. In stead, the Regulation leaves it to the imagination of the employer DHS anticipates that employers have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices. Of course, the ambiguous lanague is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law.   \n\nThe Regulation failed to mention the most obvious documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers are the employers payroll and personal records. What an employer is paying his current employees is direct and relevant evidence of how and what the employer values competent work.  In stead, the Regulations allows the employer to hide the documents that it actually relies on and use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys, to set compensation for their U.S. workers.  In short, the Regulations allow the employer and DHS to ignore reality (I.e. what is actually happening) ad substitute fantasy (i.e. what the employer and DHS hope is happening.) \n\nThe Regulations describe employers hiring high skilled STEM OPT students, thus accepting as fact that foreign students are already highly skilled in spite of the reality that the Regulations have already stated that the need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced  foreign student. \n\nFurther, the Regulations would not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business but, in stead, would open such definitions to the world by provid[ing] the Department of Labors Office of Foreign Labor Certification.  \n\nThe Regulations fail to protect U.S. workers because the Regualtions fail to gage the wages of U.S. workers. In stead, the Regualtions help ONLY the imported foreign students in gauge[ing] compliance, employers would be required to provide DHS with student compensation information, which would better situate the agency to monitor whether STEM OPT students are being compensated fairly. \n\nIf the DHS cared to protect the U.S. worker, then, the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. EMPLOYEE. That would protect the U.S. worker. \n\nThe regulation provide for on site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should/must conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet BOTH the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S. workers is in any way adversely impacted.  Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the  PAST FIVE (5) YEARS WITH NAMES, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS. \n\nThe Regualtions fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regualtions or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers.  The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.   \n\nFinally, the Regualtions fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regualtions.

Hopwever now it seems more often used by foreign students as a way to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. The DHS proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. The hidden rational appears to be that OPTs are significantly cheaper than US workers, 7.65 percent because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. Thus the result of the proposal ( whether intended or unintended) seems to be that American workers will be replaced by cheap imported labor.\n\nHere I agree with Senator Grassley of Iowa who said in his letter to the President: \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent\".\n\nIt is not as though there is a shortage of STEM graduates, there is only a shortage of CHEAP stem graduates. Both the IEEE atest to this and the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (in a 2013 study) found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3176","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Andrew Willis"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I personally strongly support this expanding!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1788","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yiya Hao"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no doubt science and technology have been and will continue to be the leading factor in economic development of any country nowadays.

Since many US companies in technical areas lead the world, practical experience in these companies becomes so valuable for new graduates and could make them competitive no matter they are going to stay in the US or go back to their home countries. I believe this is also a very important part for the US education system to make it competitive internationally. If the function is disabled, pursuing US education become much less appealing and less convincing, comparing to other education systems such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. Students will lose their confidence for US education.\n\nAlso, the demand of professional high-tech worker is increasing, which can be directly seen from the sharp increase of the H1B visa applications year by year. Companies are facing a situation that it is more and more difficult for them to hire enough technical workers. So it is hard to understand the request to stop and revoke the OPT extension rule. One of my friend was reached by more than 10 companies and national labs for opening even before his real graduation because they are lack of people with required technical knowledge and skills to work for them. This means the demand for professional high-tech workers and researchers is huge and urgent. If the work authorization can be extended and become more stable, employers can have more candidates to fill their positions and serve for them efficiently. This will definitely help the employers in the related technical industry to stay efficient and competitive in the globalized markets.\n\nThen for the cost issue, I do not think the STEM OPT rule is costly comparing to the potential benefit from it. As far as I know, many US companies especially in the IT industry are acquiring and hiring professional workers directly from the other countries due to lack of candidates in the US. Actually this is an expensive way with low efficiency. But I think the companies have no other choice because they cannot find enough candidates within the US graduates. The extension of STEM OPT may help them to attract more international students with the suitable skills to work for them. Furthermore, the OPT extension becomes very helpful as a buffer area for the H1B lottery competition to avoid potential interruption to the companies and their new internationally employees.\n\nIn general, I think to keep or to improve the STEM OPT extension rule is necessary and beneficial for not only the international students in the STEM area but also the US technical companies, US education system, and even the US economy. So I support to improve or to keep the STEM OPT extension rule. And I would like to seem its positive effect for keeping my company competitive.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2399","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Bo Peng, IBM T.J.

When something like 50% of our citizens who graduate with science and technological degrees can not find jobs in their field, it is inappropriate, treacherous, and in fact, I would suggest treasonous of a government agency to also use taxpayer money to subsidize alien workers in those roles. When you allow F-1 visa holders to remain in USA after graduation and work, they are taking Americans jobs. On top of that you are subsidizing their employers, by the fact that the employer need not pay payroll taxes for these workers. \n\nBelow are some facts that upset me:\n\tOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n\tOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\tThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\tOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\n\tSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\tIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n\tIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n\tOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\nDavid North (formerly of the US Labor Department) States the following:\n\t\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\t\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\t\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\t\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\nThis program clearly favors foreign or alien persons over Americans and is inappropriate for Homeland Security to allow.\n\nDr. Gary Mitchell\n2977 Hickory Nut Lane\nKalamazoo, MI 49004\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3315","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Gary Mitchell"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no need for further examination of the F-1 visa program, there has been plenty of study of this already; it is a destructive program that provides employers with cheap labor and gives the foreigner a virtual free greencard, the value of which is in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe program HARMS American college students and destroys the careers of older American workers.\n\nThere is also the security issue in play; why are we offering sensitive jobs to those with no allegiance to America?\n\nIt is obscene that \"our\" government is complicit in this ugly scheme.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2642","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by W.

These exposures adds up to their training experiences and once on 1st year of OPT they start working full time like any other regular candidates. Now while filing STEM extensions most of the students already have 1 to 1 and half years of US work experience (on top of any previous work experience in the field from their origin country). In fact towards the end of the 1st year OPT many students file their H1 visa applications too. Some may even have already changed jobs or in process of changing jobs while filing the STEM extension, so it may not make any sense to ask the new employer for these paper work when the employer is hiring the student thinking he is an experienced candidate to do the job. Therefore, I feel the Mentoring and Training programs may add up to unnecessary paper work in some scenarios for employers. This would even make harder for students to find a job easily because the process may seem too much extra work to employers or may make them feel the candidate is not yet prepared for the job since he needs training. I think the Mentoring and Training program needs modification depending on the students education and work profile, specifically in case of Graduate Students. Though I feel this regulation will put a restriction on students who graduate with other degrees such as Health Science, Electronics, Biotechnology etc but just take one computer course during their course work and then use that course to file their STEM extension to keep working in the field of Information Technology. This is a big loop hole which DHS should look into, many students do not find job in their specialization and but they find job in Information Technology so to save their status they jump into totally different field then their major.

I got my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering in China and I worked for Australian Transportation Department for almost one year. Then I went to Duke for a master degree in Engineering Management with a focus on Construction Management. After I came to the United States, I realize the whole construction industry in the United States is not as \"Energetic\" as I thought. At lease nothing like IT companies. Construction companies always hire people with more than 10 years experience because more and more young grads prefer to work in the office instead of going to a field. They got their degree in Civil Engineering but became a hedge fund analyst after graduation.That's why most of the construction companies in the United States are still using some old construction management system and software.   Every year, many Chinese students with a degree in Civil Engineering come to the U.S for further study.We went to Duke, Columbia University, MIT and Berkeley.  We get high education and far more advanced skills in technology. And the most important thing is that we really love civil and construction industry and we would love to make a difference in this field. After I graduated from Duke, I know I need to bring new technology into Construction Industry. I learnt new construction software(Oracle P6), BIM software and Blue Beam estimating software when I was at college. I really believe that I can help my current company shape the future by practicing my knowledge. And the 24-month Stem Extension will give me enough time to fulfill my expectation and it can definitely encourage more civil engineers working in their field and remodel the old construction pattern and introduce more advanced Technology to this industry.\nObviously, without the new OPT Extension , less students will choose Civil/Construction Engineering as their major or work in a construction company. It is definitely not something the Unites States wants to see.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0196","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Minyu Sun, Pwi Construction, Inc"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A large portion of the U.S. economy is driven by technology companies, which are majorly backed by STEM students from overseas.

Without this policy, many intelligent people might be forced to leave the country with our technology, that is not good to us.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0366","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Penny Zhu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Yes i strongly support the extension period of 24 months","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2214","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rakesh Paulraj"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Unbelievable how far are Government goes to lower the field for non-Americans and making the situation for all Americans worse.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3184","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Joseph Duarte"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is very important that opt prolong to 24 months.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1760","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Linlin Luo"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please extend the OPT for STEM students to let us better contribute to industries in the US","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1482","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Shan Shan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPT extension is not only important for the international students, but also for the US technical company.

Based on my own experience, I could tell that OPT and OPT STEM extension is important for American economy, especially for the IT industry. Internet is changing our life and there is a whole bunch of companies in Silicon Valley that are running business about Internet (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Uber, just to name a few famous ones). Their product is changing the way we live, helping us to know more information (Google, Twitter), get in touch with new/old friends (Facebook) and provide more convenient way to travel (Uber). But to achieve that, they need ENGINEERs, and there is a lacking of engineers right now in California. In contrast, many students of OPT STEM majors are qualified engineers, they are smart, passionate, and willing to make this country a better place by building great product. Without them, many tech companies can't even run their business since they can't hire enough engineers. To make it worse, since the probability of getting H1B visa is getting lower and lower every year, if the OPT STEM is revoked, then most students will doom to go back to their homeland after 1 year of their graduation. Right after they are familiar with their work, learned the skills to work efficiently and ready to make greater contribution to the company or even to the country, they will have to go back home. Or they might even decide to study in a different country (e.g. Australia) if that provides them with higher possibility to stay in that country after graduation.\n\nIn short, there is no doubt that 24 months OPT STEM extension can boost the economy of this country, improve the qualify of our life, and make America stronger and more competitive in the world.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1421","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Xiao Chen"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The policy to improve and expanding the OPT STEM Extension is an effective and helpful for F-1 nonimmigrant students.

OPT extension allows these students having more opportunities working outside campus after graduation. And consequently, not only they can be better trained, but the US society will benefit a lot since these STEM students will make great contribution to US society in so many aspects. The industry need talents that can lead it to prosperity. And prosperity of the industry can create more job opportunities and develop the economy of this country. It's a win-win situation.  \n\n2) US is a immigration country and it is made stronger and stronger by generations of outstanding immigrants. These students are likely to be outstanding enough since in order to get admitted by US colleges, they have to be the best in their country. If so, the OPT extension will allow them to have more opportunities to get a working visa so that they can contribute more to this country. If some of them are not good enough, they might just not be able to graduate or find a job, and consequently, they have to go back to their country soon no matter whether there's OPT extension or not. A healthy immigration system need to be aimed to keep talents, and talents need opportunities to show.  \n\n3) If there's no OPT extension, even these students are able to find a job in US in their OPT period, 12 months give them little opportunity to get a working visa. It's like pushing them back. And in the meanwhile, the developing countries, like China, are spending so many efforts to attract these people back. It's just unwise to simply cancel the OPT extension.\n\n4) As a conclusion, I strongly support the OPT extension.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1628","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jingshen Liu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think that this is a great and positive move towards building US economy by providing favorable environment for STEM international students.

Lots of biggest tech breakthrough enjoys the contribution of foreign talented people and in the Current USA, high-tech jobs are still lacking of suitable local candidates. In addition, now all tech industries varies from high-tech company to Hollywood industry benefit from the contribution of foreign people in STEM major. Even in academic society, there are tons of people become professors or senior researchers who was not U.S citizen, which contributes a lot to science breakthrough for USA.\n\nAlso, after more talented people has more time to work in USA, it also helps the local employers to interact with people from all of world daily and has pressure and ambition to gain more knowledge to work as a team in some certain high-tech area. Also, it also helps the globalization of the USA.\n\nAlso, it benefit the student under OPT and help them to gain more working experience in USA and do more contribute to USA.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3175","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Mike Kennard"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Re: DHS Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002, There should be no rule to expand or amend Optional Practical Training (OPT).","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3324","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by M.

It should definitely be renewed and extended to 24 months. The idea behind the program is good but it has major holes and no transparency at all. Here are suggestions:\n1.\tWho is responsible for the OPT - EAD holder: the OPT is given based on the college masters or PHD and the College should be responsible for OPT-EAD holders actions.\n2.\tOn-JOB trainings - These trainings should be well documented and presented along with EAD applications, not only should these trainings be validated but also audited against the Degree / Diploma of the OPT EAD applicant. \n3.\tOversight - EAD is issued by USCIS, this is a special extension only given to STEM degree holders, so EAD should only be extended to the applicants who are working in the same field / technology as their STEM education. \na.\tE.g.: Electrical Engineer who is working as IT Business Analyst or QA analyst is not a valid STEM EAD extension. \nb.\tE.g.: Biotech engineer working as Software Engineer or Java programmer or SAP developer or QA analyst is not a valid extension. \nc.\tE.g: MS in Computer Science performing as SAP consultants or WebSphere Developers or MQ or any other technology have to prove they learnt the skills in MS or they were trained by authorized and certified Training institute, not a training / body shop out of Sulekha.com website advertisements. \n4.\tH1b Application: OPT - EAD applicant often apply for H1b visa, their visa should be tracked back to the degree and OPT validation. \n\nThere is no oversight to flag these extensions and this cannot be acceptable.\nThese are just a few suggestions that will be falling on deaf ears and USCIS will never go the extra mile to make sure these are done but if they want to improve the program these suggestions are needed to be integrated in the program, especially the oversight part.  Unless major changes are made to this program, this comment collection exercise is futile and only an administrative task forced by the courts. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2700","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by William Penn"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As an international student who studied at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, my major is still classified as liberal arts, despite my degree is actually called a Master of Science. This has put students like me in a dilemma. On our I-20, the program's CIP (Classification of Instructional Program) is one of the followings:\n\n09.04) Journalism.\n09.0401) Journalism.\n09.0402) Broadcast Journalism.\n09.0404) Photojournalism.\n09.0499) Journalism, Other.\n\nThis makes us only eligible for a 12-month Optional Practical Training (OPT) instead of a 29-month OPT or this upcoming 36-month OPT for students in so-called science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. That might have reflected reality a couple years ago before the digital revolution took place, but nowadays, journalists really must learn coding as well, meaning programming languages such as python, in addition to understanding HTML5, Flash, CSS, adapting story to display on smart devices, etc. \n\nAs a matter of fact, New York University has recognized this and turned their journalism program CIP to 09.0702 Digital Communication and Media/Multimedia as explained at http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&cipid=87221 which would then qualify them for the 29-month or upcoming 36-month OPT as indicated by http://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2014/stem-list.pdf. My Columbia Journalism School is reluctant to coordinate with its ISSO to change this to benefit current and future students fearing this is a foul play by NYU. \n\nI am writing also because it takes a lot of time to break into the media industry. Even Laura Dimon, the daughter of JPMorgans CEO Jamie Dimon had to go on a series of freelancing and/or unpaid internships to eventually land a salaried position at CBSNews. Just imagine how hard that might be for international students whose mother tongue is not English but who knows coding. You might say why dont we just go back to our home country. As an alumnus who has seen the broken immigration system broke so many dreams of international students studying journalism in the U.S. and fearing the return to their home country to carry on the vigorous reporting, I am writing to make our voices heard. I will not benefit from this reform because I am a U.S. citizen now and it does not matter to me anymore. But I cannot bear the thought of this practice continuing to hurt courageous international students who could become the next James Foley or Steven Sotloff. For a more graphic story on our plight, please refer to this 10-min documentary at http://narrative.ly/meet-the-press/dreams-of-a-different-beat/.\n\nI have been thinking that this addition of journalism to the STEM list has to be changed by DHS so that the sanctity of journalism could be protected. It is no longer just about writing he said vs she said thru interview. It has to rely on data to fact-check the stories and make them more informative and compelling. President Obama has repeatedly mentioned how he appreciates the freedom of the press at the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner. I hope you have the courage to help convert journalism CIP into STEM-qualified as well so that we could have more journalists from other countries coming to report America back to their home audience.

I also agree with the idea of providing salary information, and the employment status information.\n\nBut the new mentorship and training program is a huge burden to any employer. \nEvery STEM OPT student will have to explain to the employer these guidelines now which is not applicable to CPT or regular OPT students. Here the 'Practical Training' policy becomes vey inconsistent across different programs.\n\nSecondly, with this sort of documentation requirement, we are basically asking employers to turn themselves into educational institute or training institute, which they are not. \n\nThere is difference in academia and real world, that's why a student needs practical training or on the job training. We learn different skills in our studies, during our practical training we try to implement some of them which can enable the supervisor/leader and the organisation on the whole to achieve their goals. But looking at I910 draft, it appears supervisor's main role is to train those who he has hired for 2 years (STEM OPT period).\n\nLastly, some OPT STEM students work in consulting firms too. That's because most big organization do not hire STEM graduates directly as they are unsure of our skills, because we do not have practical experience in the relevant area. Requirement for filing of H1B visa works as another hindrance. \n\nThe consulting firms by hiring OPT students and letting them work in big firms and giving exposure to the tools that big corporations use help in increasing student's skills manifolds. Now the STEM students and consulting firms will have to explain these scenario's and documentation to client's too.\n\nThe crux of the matter is most students in OPT do actual work just like other employed workers. That we learn skills is just by-product of the actual work we do. It is not \"Training\" and to treat it as one is a judgement far removed from reality. \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rajat Panda"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The rule is very clear and the document gives a lot of information.

US companies need them , but not for people who just complete MS and work for fake consultancy companies with fake experience..\n\n\nIf you want I can get you all these consultancy names, address and phone numbers.\n\n\nyou know whats going on in reality.. people are coming to United states and completes their masters in some easy school (there are lot of easy schools who gives CPT on first day of school and give degree for money) and get OPT work authorization and work for US clients with fake experience by joining in consultancy companies...\n\nevery year H1b petetions are increasing because of these fake people and fake jobs.\n\nI am from india, I know many indian consultancy companies ,just imagines how many countries we have and how many of consultancy companies each country have in United states..\nso imagine how many international students misusing this OPT/OPT extension.\n\nRide all consultancy companies and ban them or put them in prison for misusing these from somany years.\n\nFinally... OPT should be given to only students who can able to get fulltime job after his studies.

This proposal is certain to harm American technology workers. At a time when many American students are drowning in college debt and unable to get jobs in their fields, the US Government has no business expanding visas for foreign tech workers. Furthermore, these workers will have an unfair advantage over their American competition: Because they are technically students, their employers will not have to pay payroll taxes for them, saving the employers about $10,000 per worker for each of the three years they are in the OPT program. At the same time, because their student visas will be tied to their employers, these young workers will be open to exploitation.\nIn its initial attempt to expand OPT, DHS admitted that the extension was indeed an attempt to circumvent the caps on H-1B visas.\nNot only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their student visas will be tied to their employers). Further, because these workers are still technically students, they wont have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years theyre in the program. \n\nBefore this rule is approved, DHS should have to answer these questions: How many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers? How many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field? How the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment?\nBetween 2008 and 2012, technology companies spent close to $1.5 billion lobbying the White House and members of Congress on the immigration issue. As labor economist George Borjas writes, corporate lobbying on immigration should be the best piece of evidence needed to show that wages drop when immigration rises. As he says, why would employers tend to go to Washington and expend their resources lobbying for something that doesnt benefit them?\n\nI am a self-employed computer programmer and the mother of a college student. I am very concerned about the effects this rule would have both on my business and on the employment opportunities of our young people.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2165","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Mary Green, M.A. Green IT Consulting"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support this proposal base on the following opinions:\n\n1. Benefits to the U.S. economy.\n\nU.S. has been the #1 country in the world for years, and one of the main reasons of this success is because of its diversity.\n\nEver since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, technology innovation has become a key factor of determining a countrys place in the world, and U.S. sure grabbed this gist. This country draws talented people in by its world-class working and living environment, and pay them back with its welcoming and open mind. It brings people from different parts of the world and cultures together to do great things. There are immigrants contributing to almost every industry: IT, space exploration, military, movie, medical field, etc., and a lot of them are on the top of their respective fields. To draw more talented people in and make this country stay competitive, extending OPT extension period for STEM students sure is a good way to provide more opportunities for international students to find a job and transit to H1-B visa in order to use the knowledge they learned from U.S. universities and contribute back to this country.\n\nAccording to a 2012 report from the Information Technology Industry Council(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/stem-report.pdf), the Partnership for a New American Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, research has found that every foreign-born student who graduates from a U.S. university with an advanced degree and stays to work in STEM has been shown to create on average 2.62 jobs for American workersoften because they help lead in innovation, research, and development., and this report only shows the value and job opportunities STEM students had been creating until 2012. In fact, according to another report(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf), immigrants were founders of 18 percent of all Fortune 500 companies, many of which are high-tech giants. As of 2010, these companies generated $1.7 trillion in annual revenue, employed 3.6 million workers worldwide, and included well known companies like AT&T, Verizon, Google, United States Steel, Nordstrom, and so on. The value that STEM students have been and will be bringing to the U.S. economy and workforce is tremendous.\n\n(Reference: http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/always-demand-economic-contributions-immigrant-scientists-and-engineers)\n\n\n2. Benefits to the daily lives of American citizens.\n\nFirst and most important of all, STEM students create more job opportunities. More and more native-born workers get jobs and the ability to live a better life, which leads to a more health and stable society. As the growth of STEM related industries, other non-STEM industries will also experience a business booming caused by this growth. For example, the Yelp mobile app created a more direct way for information exchanging between businesses and customers and has been benefiting billions of businesses. In todays technology world, the influence of STEM industries are unignorable.\n\nIn a smaller picture, the influence of the growth of STEM related industries to our lives is obvious. They make our daily activities easier and do the things that could only be seen in Sci-Fi movies 50 years ago. Google Map, Tesla electric car, Yelp, Uber, those innovations have become so close to our lives that we cannot even imagine how people in the 80th live without these technologies. It has been a true life-changing experience thanks to the booming of STEM industries.\n\nLast but not least, STEM students make America a truly multicultural society. In this very land of freedom, people has a chance to be friends with people from other part of the world, try different food, learn different cultures. It is not only what makes this country attractive for talented people from all over the world, but also how it becomes the #1 country in the world, and STEM students are a very important part of it.\n\n\n\n3. Benefits to STEM students.\n\nSTEM students are eager to find a job in the U.S. after graduating from school. U.S. is the headquarter of innovations. Gaining industry-leading work experience could benefit their career and enhance businesses between U.S. and their home country. But as more and more STEM students coming in every year, the chance of winning the H1-B lottery becomes less and less. This leaves a lot of talented people no choice but go home. Extending OPT-Extension period could give them more chances to win the lottery and keep serving this country. For those highly competitive majors, this proposal could give those good-standing candidates more time to find a job so that their talent could have enough time to be discovered, and the companies could choose from best of the best.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this proposal is a win-win for both U.S. government and STEM students. Therefore I strongly support it.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0835","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Gavin Li"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is good for us economics.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1144","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ziyi Jiang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is very helpful to F1 students.

Blindly extending OPT can endanger national security. Who would benefit from this extension of OPT? Foreign students. Most of them are born and raised in different ideologies than in the U.S. Most of them would pick their native country when it comes to national security, without a heartbeat. Is there a guaranteed reason for them to change their affection through a couple of years of student life? Not very likely. And not for everybody. Why would America unconditionally allow these people to stay and bring uncertainty into national security? Let's not forget what identity some of the 9/11 terrorist entered and stayed in the country. The answer is F1 student visa.\n\n2. Giving away leading position in technology and knowledge. Allowing these foreign students to come and study, then allowing them to gain access to industry, it does no good to America but giving away technology and knowledge. It is not a secret that some foreign government are actively stealing from US firms for technology even without the aid of insiders. Allowing these foreigners to gain more access to the industry would make it even easier for foreign government to steal from the United States. For example, government A could be calling a student who just been hired into a tech firm to either insert a flash drive into a company's database or have his family back in his native country to face hardship. What would the student choose?\n\n3. By giving the opportunities to foreign students, it takes opportunities away from American students. It is a zero sum game in most of the situation. I have heard foreign students complaining about America and alleging allegiance to their native country at the same time. I think it is not fair for Americans.

There are a few reasons that lead to my decision:    \n\n1. STEM students will have more opportunities to get H-1B visa in visa lottery to work in the US. Those students, who got high-level education from the US universities and training from the US companies, are very knowledgeable and skilled in STEM fields which are very important fields to US industry and economy. With new OPT extension rule, those students can contribute their skills and knowledge to the companies and therefore the US.     \n\n2. US companies will benefit from this new rule. Many US companies are growing and expanding their business, they are really short of hands (high-level skilled and experienced employees). The new rule will make it possible to hire eligible foreign students to work for companies for longer time. This also increases diversity of labors in the US.      \n\n3. US Universities will benefit from the new rule. The new rule will attract more foreign students to come to the US for study, because they have more possibility to stay and work in US after graduation. So this will create more job opportunities in education field and also in other related fields (Housing, Food and Restaurants, Car Buying, Insurance, etc.)       \n\n4. With the requirement that STEM OPT students should have commensurate wage with the US workers, the companies cannot consider paying less wage to OPT students than US workers so that both have equal opportunities to a job position. This will help to build a fairly good labor market in US which is beneficial to both OPT students and US workers.   \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2410","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Shishan Sun"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I agree with the extension of OPT, it doesn't make sense with out giving proper chance to students prooving themselves what they learn from the masters.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1613","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Raviteja  Sankati"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is so wrong to place anybody above or before anybody else.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, every year I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting.The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers.  \nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest technologies in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months \nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals.Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\nConclusion \nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n \nSincerely,\n\nAnish .\n ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3119","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anish Nair"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1858","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Bo Miao"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Strongly support the proposed extension since it is a requirement to boost American economy, retain talent pool, remain competitive in the global market.

DHS should investigate this and also publish new rules stating that OPT would be cancelled or H1 visa would not be granted to students who work in unrelated areas.\n\nI also would like DHS and USCIS to look into another issue where some of the students who are filing H1B visas apply with multiple employers or consultancies by paying H1B visa fees as they are incompetent which would lessen the chances for other students who are sincerely working hard and are much more talented than those people who are filing multiple H1B visas, hence the one who has much more talent and creative in mind who would help United States to create new job opportunities would be forced to leave the country as the H1B visa lottery is more and more competitive and lessens the chances of such people.\n\nFinally I would like to say that expanding OPT time is a very good idea and helps thousands of students who pursue their Masters to gain valuable experience which cannot happen else where and help students to come up with creative ideas which would help create new job opportunities so I strongly support this idea and DHS/USCIS should rectify the issues with students working in non related areas to their area of study and they should investigate if its really related or not, and also publish strict rules against multiple filing of H1B visas even with multiple employers are the chances for other students would be reduced and a student who is really good may end up leaving the country.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2372","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Shashi Vardhan Reddy Dayam"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am International Student and I fully support the proposed law for OPT STEM Extension.

And I think it is better to change the law into that giving every STEM students a H1B or green card automatically when they get the degree, just like many other countries do, say Canada.\nAnyway, it is a good progress to extend the OPT time to 36 months. It is definitely good to US.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2239","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jack Wang, University of Texas at Dallas."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be! valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" This is a very important quote from Sen.

So more time means more job opportunities, they can have more training on their major as well as service the US enterprise. That is a good thing! Both foreign students and US people can benefit from it.\n\nFurthermore, this extension policy is a good example of American tradition. As we know, America is a immigration country which allow people from different place come here and struggle to fulfill their American Dream in history. For the foreign students who wish to have job in US, they are brilliants, excellent and they have dream to service with more American people. Why we don't just give them this chance, give them more freedom to change their fate?\n\nSome people may worried about the foreign students would take off the job opportunities from local American. I understand but I still have to say that is no make sense. More high education degree people join the US market, they can give more power to the US economic. They make the enterprise more powerful at the same time more powerful enterprise provide more employment. And also, now is the global economic time, if US do not give them the chance, these excellent people can only return to their own country and server their own enterprise. Then this enterprise will really take off the job from the whole American people.\n\nSo in conclusion,   i think the extension of OPT is quiet a good thing. I hope every American people may consider this problem seriously. And I hope this time US can still show our proud American dream to the whole world.

I will first address the benefits of having the OPT STEM program and then point out many flaws in criticisms against it.\n\nOPT STEM program creates job and value-add for U.S. economy. There are approximately 900,000 international students studying in the U.S., and they pump $27 billion into the U.S. economy each years, supporting 350,000 American jobs. It is not uncommon for an overseas family to spend $100,000 or more per year for their child's college tuition and living expenses in America. Many of these students are attracted to U.S. universities not only because of the high education quality but also the prospects of working for U.S. firms for some time to learn the valuable skills that will benefit their long-term career goals. One year of OPT is apparently not enough to cultivate any meaningful experiences, especially for STEM fields whose research projects usually last for years. Not having the STEM option will make the whole U.S. education experience less attractive compared to other U.S. competitors who are aggressively attracting foreign talents such as Singapore, Germany, U.K. etc,...\n\nThe most important contribution of STEM students though are the new products and businesses they create after joining the workforce. According to a report by The New American Economy, 40% of the largest U.S. firms were founded by immigrants or first-generation immigrants, including many hottest tech startups. For example, Whatsapp, which sold to Facebook for $19 billion, was founded by a Ukrainian immigrant. In Silicon Valley, 50 percent of the tech companies, from Google to eBay, have an immigrant founder. 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child or an immigrant. For every 100 international STEM students who remain in the U.S. after graduation, 262 American jobs are created.\n\nCritics of the STEM OPT program have argued that STEM graduates accept lower pay, steal job and that there is no lack of demand for STEM workers. These claims are extremely ill-informed. First foreign STEM graduates usually work for high-tech firms and require much higher pay, especially those with Ph.D. degress. Second, there is higher risk to hire foreign STEM students and therefore the standards imposed on them are also higher. If they manage to get the jobs, you can't say that the jobs are stolen.

As a electrical engineering student, I work seven days a week without break, I try to do as much research as I can on campus. One main purpose of those hard working is that I want to have a good job after graduation. If OPT does not extend to 36 months, many employers will not hire us, in that case, how can we gain practical experience? I believe a main attractive advantage for foreigner student is they can have good practical experience in USA after graduation. The 36 months OPT will definitely attracts more student coming to USA for education, which will do much benefits to all Americans. I am very excited to see this OPT extension passing soon.

Thus, they decided to go back to their home country to start their company there instead of staying in U.S. to start one or work for one start-up. If more forced to do so, this will affect not only the high tech industry but also they would rather not seek higher education in U.S..

This rule would greatly alleviate the US tech industry's shortage for right talent. The industry is already feeling it difficult to hire the right talent and retain them. US being number one destination for international students seeking quality education and exposure, it attracts lot of young and diversified talent from across the globe, it makes no sense to let go these highly trained and capable students and not to use their skills to make this nation economically and technologically more powerful. A careful glimpse at the number of international students contributing to the research and development in the universities and industry shows how valuable their services are to this nation.\nThe argument which says international students taking away the jobs of local Americans is not true at all. These students do not get any reservation for jobs in any sector. They are hired solely based on their skills and competency. Without the right skills and knowledge of the technology, no industry would be interested in hiring any candidate either local Americans or international graduate. Having the right skill is the key for getting hired.\nI am glad that DHS is driving this proposal promptly to get to final stages. Having said that, I would like to express my concerns regarding the implementation of this rule. In section B (STEM Extension Period for OPT) DHS says that it lacks authority to approve any cases after 13-Feb-2016, and would consider different options to deal with the situation. I would like to stress on the point that almost all the students (Bachelor, Graduate, Doctoral) who graduated in Dec14 - Jan15 would have their 12 month OPT end date in Jan16 - Feb16. In case of a delay in implementing this rule before the deadline, what would be the status of the students who still have their applications pending? How can they maintain status before they are approved under the new rule? I therefore request DHS to please consider the situation of such students and make provisions accordingly so that they maintain status and leverage the OPT STEM extension under the new rule. Getting this rule into implementation before 13-Feb-2016 is the key factor in avoiding all the chaos caused by student statuses.\n\nThank you \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1522","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Prashanth Giri"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We are expecting 6yrs of OPT ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0933","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Naveen Gadde"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The rule proposal is really an amazing news for the international students that provides college graduates from valid institutions to build up their careers also help to bring up the American economy!

There is for a fact that the economy lacks of US professional to cover the high demand of STEM professionals required and this is the reason why this ruling was proposed in 2008 in the first place. Moreover, it also benefits the companies because there is more offer of STEM professional in the market and therefore salaries tend to go down to a reasonable average (offer and demand curve). Finally, the government also increases its revenues from all this STEM professionals that are paying taxes to contribute to the development of this great nation.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2798","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jose D.

Here is my comment on this issue based on my own experience.\n\nI received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from a Top 10 U.S. university. During my 5 years at graduate school, I received full scholarship (tuition waiver + monthly salary) which is about $400k in total and is funded completely by U.S. taxpayers (my university is a public university, and my research project was funded by U.S. Army). \n\nIf there is no OPT STEM extension available for me, under the current regulation, I have only 12 months of OPT. This is enough for doing the H1B lottery once, which has a ~50% chance of being approved. If I am not lucky enough to get the H1B work visa, I need to leave U.S. immediately after my 12-month OPT.\n\nThis means U.S. taxpayers spent $400k on training me and have a ~50% chance of losing me to a foreign country in 12 months. This means my employer, a top high-tech U.S. company has ~50% chance of losing a good employee after 12 months. I think this is a bad deal for U.S.\n\nAnd I am by no means competing with U.S. citizens for job opportunity. In my industry, there is a significant shortage of advanced degree workers. And there are simply not enough students majoring in this area (let alone enough U.S. citizens).\n\nIn the proposed rule, this won't be an issue since an F1 student with advanced degree in STEM will have at least 3 tries for H1B lottery. At ~50% approval rate, 3-4 tries result in only ~10% chance of not getting a H1B visa. This is much better than the current rule.\n\nI sincerely hope this proposed rule can be approved to help boost the U.S. economy. In case you need further information from me, I can be reached via email.

US should keep higher education for foreigners and local job opportunities separate. All local job opportunities should be offered first to residents as companies are laying off locals and hiring F1s on low wage. F1s should be mandated to be hired on higher wages than prevailing wages so companies genuinely try to hire residents and citizens first rather than hiring F1s on priority. F1s are hired on low wages and then treated miserably with lower increments, long work hours etc. and they do it as this is the only way they can stay in US. All that American dream stuff comes years later when they are already through their youth. Stop this extension ASAP as this encourages back door entry and companies are exploiting this practice. Students even after getting hired want to remain on OPT as this way they avoid social security taxes and only when their OPT is about to end is when they transfer H1B. Govt is losing so much on taxes because of the current extension itself and this exerts undue pressure on people who are paying these taxes. Has anybody in govt done this cost benefit analysis? Studying in US should just be considered as a upper edge than studying anywhere in the world and providing a US job after US study should not be guaranteed.

There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Masters degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nHence this new rule is very important for the U.S economy and timely implementation of this rule will prevent imposing a costly burden on the U.S. tech sector if thousands of young workers have to leave their jobs on February 12, 2016.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0331","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Mass Mail Campaign 22: Comment Submitted by Pranav Mungre, Total as of 10/23/2015 (2)"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I believe it would be necessary that the STEM-Opt students in jeopardy because of this rule be allotted more time or given some sort of pardon as they could be deported unnecessarily.

He has a degree in Geology, is highly intelligent and is a great asset to this country. By revoking the OPT and STEM extension the DHS will be sending this highly talented and productive USA educated young man  to another country that will be competing economically with the USA. \nOPT, H1B visas and E2 Visa all bring in productive people to the USA economy, however none of them lead to permanent residency. People on these visa so desperately want to be part of America that they are good citizens, study and work hard and contribute more than the average person to the USA economy. If OPT was cancelled these students would look to other countries to take their talents.\nThe DHS are able to monitor these people and revoke visas if they do not play by the rules. These students DO NOT take jobs from USA citizens. As in my sons experience, many companies will not look at a foreign application if there are good applications from USA citizens. It is easier and less expensive for a company to employ a USA citizen and they are not subject to having the employee leave the job if they cannot obtain an H1B visa.\nThe USA should be helping to keep these people in the USA and should also be looking to provide a path to citizenship for these talented young people.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2840","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Alison Dennis"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If these foreign workers are SSOOOO...

I work in Detroit. I am in favor of this decision of providing OPT stem extension of 24 months because of following reasons. My view and suggestions are purely related to Automotive Engineering. \n\n1)Taxes and Tuition fees: Taxes paid by an international student is high. Moreover the tuition fees paid by them are three time more that American Citizen. Allotting 24 months of OPT results in attracting more Students from foreign countries. We pay these fees and taxes because USA is land of dreams where I can explore my knowledge, skills and social life.\n\n2) A chance to obtain practical Knowledge: After graduating from accredited university the candidate is still clueless because lack of practical knowledge. 24 months OPT helps them to shine their skills and explore the technologies. \n\n3) Patents: Most of the international students graduate with Masters degree. They have SAE ad other papers released. They have patents which can be property of OEM's like GM, FORD and Chrysler. They hire them and sponsor these international students resulting in gaining ownership of those patents. This is very important point because the proportion of patents own by foreign student in USA is considerable and valuable. \n\n4)Companies Attraction because of International student :  Detroit unemployment rate were high but now it has decreased. Its lower that other states in USA now. Because OEM and suppliers all around the world want to do business in Detroit because its motor city and they know they will get reliable resources like International student graduating from accredited universities like \"University of Michigan\".  International Student Employee availability helps the company to integrate their technologies in the USA and hence transferred to locals. Like Just in Time manufacturing technique from Toyota.  \nEmployer is always looking for a skilled employee. \n\n5) U.S Department of commerce: According to US department of commerce International student contributed $27 billion to US economy. \n\nThankyou","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1648","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Nikhil K."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a great proposal.

As there aren't as many native STEM graduates as the market demands, a lot of those international students eventually stayed in this country and continued their contribution. \n\nWith the growing number of H1B applicants (duplicate applications, oversea consulting firms submitting massive amount of applications) and limited quota, a lot of international students who have finished the degree in this country and found a job are having trouble staying in this country legally. The result is brutal to those who have been settling in at their job already. They are forced to relocate just because they weren't selected in the random lottery system which by no means determine the quality and importance of their work. And it is also a great loss to the employers who hire those international STEM graduates. \n\nTherefore, I think this rule is very timely necessary as the first step to fix the broken immigration system.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2678","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Bingyue Xiong, AirWatch by VMware"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Nice proposal waiting for implementation.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0466","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sivaji Ganesh Kandimalla"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the new revisions and extending the OPT period for a total of 24 months however I find the E-Verify requirement to be of great limitation to the potential of the program.\nI can't find a logical reason to propose an employment verification requirement for the extension period but not the regular OPT period. It should be either applied to the whole program or waived as a requirement. After earning my Master's degree, I worked for the City of Seattle and had to resign since the City is not enrolled in E-Verify nor does it have policies enabling employee sponsorships.\nI find this requirement an unnecessary burden. I was working for a Municipal entity and helping in capital improvement projects and now all I care about is finding an E-verify enrolled company.

Many of those students are funded through US government/industry grants. On an average $200,000 is spent on a PhD student towards his degree, and it makes no sense to train these highly qualified people and then letting them go without any contribution to our economy. \n\nInternational students add significant value to the U.S. economy after graduation as researchers and entrepreneurs. Measures that would make it easier for STEM graduate students to obtain visas to work in the U.S. after graduation - measures that many in higher education see as crucial to the U.S. maintaining its edge in attracting international graduate students -- are critical to sustained economic expansion.  \n\nOther countries are developing policies to promote the influx of foreign students to their shores, and there are also ways in which the current economy in the United States has reduced funding support for graduate students, which makes it more difficult to attract students to U.S. programs with attractive funding packages. It is the right time to ease visa/resident requirements to enable this considerable talent to remain and contribute to the future of our research and development activities or forfeit our lead to other nations.\n\nA report by the National Foundation for American Policy found that U.S. employers have spent some $3 billion in mandatory application fees since 2000 to bring over foreigners on H-1B employment visas, hardly a cheap expense, and foreign nationals are often paid much more in the United States than they would make in their home countries.\n\nThe argument that students on STEM OPT can replace US workers is very weak one. There is an annual cap (85,000) on the non-immigrant H1-B visas, which is a strong disincentive to hire foreign nationals. Implementing this rule is not going to change that H1-visa limit, but give enough time for students on OPT to have ample time to go through relevant experience and for the industry to get value in that time frame. A typical project in the industry/academia goes for 2-3 years (NSF grants etc.), so students with only 12 months OPT do not even qualify for those projects, in addition to the time spent in searching for an opportunity. Perhaps this program should be more flexible in regards to unemployment period and volunteer work. \n\nOne concern is regarding students currently on STEM OPT extension. The rule does not provide any guidelines on what will be the consequences faced by students with approved EADs through 17 months STEM extension program, in the event that the rule is not in place by 02/13/2016. \n\nNevertheless the upshot is that if we do not use this resource in the interests of our nation, someone else will. \n\nThanks. \n\nJohn Billingham ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0952","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by John Billingham"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPT extension is one of the key components for a better immigration system which contributes to the growth of US economy and technology advancement.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0848","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Candy Tang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's a win-win game for international student and the States","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1245","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Zhengzhe Zhu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly agree with this proposed rule.

And when these students go back to their own country, they will become a bridge between their homecountry and US. They will help the free trade and make the communication easier than before. US offers scholarship to many students to come to American schools, we want them to serve us and help us grow our economy after graducation. It makes no sense to send them back just after graduation and 1 year's OPT may not enough to get experience in US and understand US good enough to become the bridge between two countries.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0527","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ternence Yin"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We do not need a program of this type.

I had spent 5 years in America to study the software related courses. I thought here, in the America, I can learn the most advanced software related technology. And nowadays, english is not the big problem any more. We could talk with each other fluently. I have lots of American friends which told me that they like Chinese food and culture very much. They would like to play with us and share each other's culture. It seems like we can learn something from each other. After that I also wanted to have a software job in America. Why I say that. Because in those 5 years, what I saw, what I heard, what I did, are all I like. It is make me really feel I am in a freedom country. Therefore, I think to extend the OPT is a very necessary action.

This action will not only benefit international STEM students, but also strengthen the science/technological power of United States, maintain the economy growth, and finally create more job positions for both immigrates and citizens.\n\nFirst,  24 months extension period will surely benefit the international STEM student, especially for recent years when the economy is stumbling. International students have already been tied with more restrictions than green card holder or citizen in many fields (Mechanical Engineer, EE, Environmental Management, etc.). It is really hard for STEM students to find a position within 1 year, which are hurdling their ability to contribute to this country. If the extension period can be lengthened from 17 months to 24 months, it will give STEM students more time to adjust themselves to the job market.\n\nSecond, lengthening the extension period from 17 months to 24 months will strengthen the science/technology power of United States. We all agree that the science/technological power is the key competitiveness of United States. However, it seems that: not everyone notices the fact that the science/technology power need people to contribute and do real research! Only when United States have people to do the research in science/technology can it beat other countries in the global competitions. As a result, STEM students are the most valuable resource to maintain the leading position of United States. International students consists a great portion of the population in STEM fields. The best strategy should be: keeping these STEM students in U.S, let them contribute to this country after getting the best training/education in U.S for several years. It will be stupid to push these STEM students back to other countries to increase their competitiveness over United States, using the best education they got from United States.\n\nThird, keeping the STEM students could give them more chances to contribute to this country, and maintain the economy growth, and finally increase the job position for U.S citizen. Many STEM fields (Mechanical Engineer, Mathematic, Physics) are too hard and too bored for most citizens. As the result, the citizen population is so small. However, this country need engineers to develop rockets in SpaceX, create autopilot cars in Tesla, need scientists crack equations in nuclear power stations, teach the next generation about the most marvelous wisdom human beings have ever created. Their jobs have great external effects and will benefit the entire economy, increase, not decrease, the number of job positions in this country. \n\nAbove all, I fully support the action of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0781","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Xiaoli Chen"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I totally support it.

An expansion of the OPT program is not in the national interest of the United States.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2551","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Paul Chellis"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"SCREW THE GOD DAM FOREIGNERS TAKE CARE OF LEGAL UNITESD STATES CITIZENS FIRST.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Thomas Goss"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is good for lots of students to get industrial experience after completing graduation .","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2292","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Bhagirath Bhargav Reddy Gudi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am totally against the de facto guest worker program like OPT since it will allow companies to hire foreign workers at lower wages than American workers.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3539","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Barclay McCort, Salado Area Republican Women"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just read an article, which I verified at the DHS website, that the Department of Homeland Security, on 19/16/15, increased the time that an alien college graduate, with a STEM Degree, can work in the U.S. to three years.  The reason they gave in extending their F-1 student visa status was to allow the students to gain on-the-job-learning.\nMy understanding is that by hiring these graduates, companies do not have to deduct Social Security and Medicare taxes from these employees  a savings of $12,000 per year. \nUnless these employers can prove that they cannot find U.S. college graduates, with STEM Degrees, we are creating an unfair hiring advantage to alien graduates over our very own college graduates. This is a terrible plan!\nImmigration policies should be for our countrys benefit not to encourage the  hiring of aliens over our own unemployed citizens. According to the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Sarah R. Saldaa, Our nation will benefit from keeping international students here, educated in U.S. colleges and universities here while they receive additional training, rather than sending them out of the country. At the same time, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by U.S. educated-STEM students, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries.  \nWe are not talking about students who have business degrees in their native countries; we are talking about high school graduates who are not required to have previous STEM working experience in their native countries before they enter our colleges or universities. We are not sending them out of the country; we are giving them an educational STEM Degree and letting them return to their own countries to enhance their own countries business communities. At the same time our colleges and universities are charging out of state tuition fees.\n\nI ask myself, Who benefits under this program? First the foreign students benefit because they get a college degree in STEM and on the job training with a mentor for three years while they are being paid. They also get experience in our business community and marketplace. Secondly their foreign countries  benefit because when the students return, they have STEM educated students with three years of practical experience in STEM companies. Finally our STEM businesses benefit because they get employees at a cost benefit of $36,000 for three years.\nNow, who doesnt benefit? First qualified U.S. students who have to compete for jobs against alien students who save the hiring companies $36,000. These are students, most likely with student loans, trying to enter a job market that already has millions of other students graduating with not nearly enough jobs waiting for them. Secondly our countrys Social Security and Medicare Programs loose taxes that would have been collected from U.S. citizen student graduates working in those jobs.\n\nThe only reason for this program extension should be allowed is if the companies hiring these students can prove that they cannot get qualified U.S. citizen graduates for these jobs. To prevent companies from entering this program just to get cheap labor, they should have to pay the students the same pay scale that a U.S. student would have gotten for the same job and charge the student an on the job training/mentoring  fee of $12,000.00 per year. The fee would go onto our Social Security and Medicare Programs. Otherwise these students are being exploited by the companies to obtain cheap labor at our own college graduates expense.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2796","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Lorraine Humes"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a great policy,definitely benefitting this country.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1796","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Peter Charles"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm in support of all the provisions provided in the rule.

Already we  have too many foreign workers competing against American workers.  My son who has strong technical skills and over 10 years of experience lost his job a year and a half ago when IBM laid off 6000 workers.   It was over a year before he got a new  job.  He was competing against H-1B workers.\n\nHowever, IBM , as are many other companies, is utilizing as many H-1B candidates as possible and I am sure will utilize as many OPT workers as it can, as by not having to pay Medicare taxes and FICA it  saves them money and they are hiring younger cheaper labor.   Meanwhile capable and willing Americans are underemployed or un-employed while they could fill the same job.   \n\nI read that a GOA report says there is also a national security problem as DHS does not know where tens of thousands of students are living and working or whether they are maintaining their legal status.  OPT doesn't seem like a good idea for our national security.\n\nOPT appears to be just a de facto guest worker program not a training program so students can go back to their home countries.   If they have a college degree or a master's degree, they do not need to work as an intern at low pay to get further training.    OPT will lower the wages and living standards of American workers, and result in more citizens without technical jobs or underemployed.  \n\nAlso, there are studies that show there are many American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.  Why let companies abuse H-1B and OPT to hire cheap labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35?.

Generally, I am never wanting for stimuli that foster a visceral disgust at the everyday sellout of U.S. citizens in employment context; there is a rotten cornucopia of anecdotes involving U.S. citizens being cut loose so that foreign workers can take their place. On occasion, U.S. citizens have had to endure the humiliation of training their foreign replacements. \n\nThe laws and regulations concerning the conduct of business and commerce in the United States ought to form a framework that unequivocally makes the training and hiring of non-citizens a measure of last resort. \n\nLet me repeat that thought in a different context for emphasis. \n\nAs of October 28, 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau's \"Population Clock\" (http://www.census.gov/popclock/) reports there are roughly 322,049,XXX million persons residing in the United States. The \"USA QuickFacts\" from the Census Bureau (http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html) reports that in 2014, 23.1% of people in the U.S. were under age 18, with 14.5% over age 65. Businesses in the United States should be compelled by law to hire from that vast pool (over 18 and under 65) a U.S. citizen. There should be provision in the law for the hiring of non-citizens, but *only* as a measure of last resort. Common sense compels the conclusion that to do anything less is to give U.S. citizens seeking employment the proverbial \"shaft.\"\n\nI am doubtful that there are not enough U.S. citizens with STEM degrees, either unemployed or seeking employment in STEM fields, to fill the vacancies that these businesses purport are best filled by foreigners. To a greater degree, I am certain that the businesses which complain of an ache that can only be soothed by foreign labor are motivated by the desire to pay lower wages and lower employment taxes.\n\nMake the right decision, and be lauded for sticking up for U.S. citizens with STEM degrees that are unemployed or seeking employment in a STEM field.\n\nMake the wrong decision, and this U.S. citizen will make yet another entry in the list of \"Instances of the Government Favoring the Interests of Foreigners over the Interests of Citizens.\"\n\n\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2791","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Dale Race"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I advocate the OPT extension:\n\nFirstly, I majored in economics and believe that the government regulations in accordance with the economy rules have profound benefit to the whole society, like the OPT extension will definitely stimulate the business. If American cultivated those foreign students with the excellent education resources and let them leave, is it a wise decision? In my opinion, the government should make use of those cheaper labors with fresh edge knowledge before they leave U.S.. What's more, small business is the sinew of the economy. The foreign minorities usually are willing to do part-time volunteer job in the small company. This kind of high-educated free labor provides the timely help to the small businesses which have great ideas but are struggling with the profit-expense balance problem. The economy is complicated, like the minimum salary can increase the employee income but will decrease the job opportunities and increase the unemployment, and finally the existing employees will have to overload, what's worse, the soar unemployment causes the social problems. We should confess that the avoid of OPT extension also has much more harmful effect.\n\nSomeone may argue that the foreign students would threaten the local employment, however they jump to the conclusion because they are not familiar with the OPT extension regulation which is not H1B at all. The foreign students should leave U.S., if the OPT expires and they cannot find the company help them apply H1B visa. In addition, with the same competence, for a long-term position, a company will hire an American student or a foreign student? Definitely American student? Why? Because hiring a foreign student costs more such as H1B application, green card application and the risk of rehiring if any application process fails. Then the foreign students should be over-qualify to get the job, and the less competent foreigners have to left is they cannot find a job within the first 3 months of the OPT period.\n\n ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0393","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Mao Meng"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The American worker continues to be marginalized incrementally, and perhaps even imperceptibly, by a series of actions.

In addition, these foreign students are being paid less than their American counterparts which allows American companies to reap profits at the expense of Americans, and are misusing the program to stay in the U.S. longer than they would have been able to.\n\nFurthermore, as Senator Charles Grassley has stated, \n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\nIs the DHS TRULY the Department of Homeland Security, or simply the Department of Foreign Security?\n\n\nThomas Reddie","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3503","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Thomas Reddie"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Why are we making it harder for Americans to get some of the good paying jobs still out there?

The unmatched study environment and being surrounded by talented people motivate me and my friends to work hard and do a better job. There will be better transitions for students who study here if they could have the hands-on experiences in the states after they graduate. I feel some majors, such as STEM majors might be better tailored to the industries in the United States. For example, I am studying actuarial science here. Insurance industries in the United States are quite different from other countries. I could be able to apply my knowledge and learn more by starting my career here. I am also able to bring in different perspectives to the companies, help them in their expansions in the oversea offices. That would be difficult for me to continue my career and realize my dream as an actuary by starting some places else.That's why an extension in training opportunities for F-1 students would mean a lot and benefit lots of parties. There will be more capable candidates, or labor supply, in our market. Reducing the waste in the resources in terms of college education is another point. The universities and colleges train F-1 students on average for 4 years and let them go back to their home countries is a waste of education resources. Instead, it is better to keep them. PLEASE reconsider the length of the training opportunities.

TO attract more international students and enable them to contribute to the society, the department of Homeland Security(DHS) announced an expanded list of science, technology, engineering, and math(STEM) designated- degree programs in 2012. There are several psychology programs that are eligible for the OPT extension. Currently industrial and organizational psychology is not officially on the list; however,as far as I know, all around America, this major is very research focused. It will be a big loss for both international students who majored in I/O psychology and the society if our international graduates lose the opportunity to contribute to the American scientific and social development with what we learned just because of the difference of several figures. There are much less international students majored in psychology compared to many other majors. Definitely, international students could bring in psychology multi-cultural insights and more education investment. There are 4 I//O program in Great New York Area now, which is I/O Psychology Program in NYU; Social/ Organizational Psychology program in Teachers' College, Columbia University; I/O Psychology Program in Baruch College, CUNY; I/O Psychology Program in Hofstra University. NYU has taken an initiative in changing the code of their M.A. in I/O psych from 42.2804 to 42.2799. and made it eligible for STEM OPT extension. With more and more international students studying in psychology, especially interested in I/O psychology, I think it's time to bring this problem to public's attention. \n\nI'd like reiterate the necessity of changing I/O psychology major code and make it eligible for OPT extension. \nFirst, it's unfair to claim supporting for research projects for OPT extension on one side, but on the other side exclude our major in list, which is a very research oriented subject.  Attached please find curricula from all four programs in I/O psychology. Almost all of our courses cover research methods, statistics, social psychology, and focus on theories in I/O psychology field. As an I/O psychology major student in hofstra myself, over 80% school works do with literatures, readings, studies and researches. Out of 43 credits required in this 2 years program, only 6 points are for internship training, which is obviously comparable to other STEM major. You can't deny I/O psychology is still much more research oriented though some programs also emphasize practical aspects. Both scientific and practical aspects are crucial for I/O psychology. They are not contradictory. Such a research oriented subjects should be included in STEM in terms of STEM's purpose and equality.\nSecond, because now I/O psychology is now only offering 12 months OPT extension, less and less international students are going to pursue higher degrees in I/O psychology. It definitely has an adverse impact on I/O psychology program development and research. Multicultural environment raises more research topic in workplace psychology research nowadays. America needs more researchers from different cultures to work on it. International students are the major source for this important I/O field. Please don't intimidate those who have a strong desire in I/O research by merely setting  limitations in their OPT. Extra OPT time will definitely attract more international students in I/O psychology field and even promoting other psychology programs' recruitment. This opportunities allows international students to gain more experience in I/O workplace and be more confident in their future career in I/O research. More internal researchers will only benefit I/O psychology development in the long round.\nNeedless to say, education investment from international students is a great incentive for higher education development. Considering most of I/O students are encouraged to get Ph.D degrees. Recruiting more international students will definitely refill the funding gap in current programs.\n\nI believe including industrial and organizational psychology major into STEM is both necessary and beneficial for the society and research development in America, while excluding it is a big loss for both American academia and society. It will be highly appreciated if you could consider I/O psychology code-changing issue.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Xiaozhen Wu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This regulations is absolutely necessary and beneficial both for the international students who major in STEM and all the employer in US including government, companies, institutions, etc. The 24-month OPT extension in addition to the original 12-month OPT would doubtlessly bring more STEM students with required skill sets that are necessary for performing work that are important to the US economy.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1429","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jin Wang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is great.

My employer would have definitely applied for H1B in April 2015 had we known STEM OPT extension was going to be cancelled and I actually had only 12 months OPT. The ruling is so sudden and unfair and it has left thousands of students like me with no other option but to leave the country on February 2016 if a new STEM extension rule is not implemented by then. \n\nInternational students with STEM degrees add great value to the United States workforce especially in the technical fields. I was glad to see the DHS had proposed a new rule which will allow STEM graduates to apply for a 24 month OPT extension. I urge the government to implement the new proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension as it will hugely benefit both the United States economy and provide STEM students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in their specific technical fields for an additional 24 months.\n\nRegards,\nAshwin Karpur Bhaskar","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3185","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ashwin Karpur Bhaskar"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a master of statistics now at Rutgers University on F-1 VISA.

With the competition for talent intensifying with China, India, Brazil and Europe, America needs these highly educated and trained folks to contribute towards the American economy. The US economy is poised for amazing growth in the information, hi-tech manufacturing and renewable energy sectors and this is a way for USA to keep the talent here. With the H1-B process becoming more convoluted and no preference being given to American educated foreign nationals, this 24-month extension will ease the drain that has been happening for the past two years where educated, highly skilled workers leave the country even when employers want to keep them here. The companies, the economy and in turn the people will benefit greatly by absorbing as many highly skilled workers as possible. \n\nIn fact, it wouldn't be too far fetched to say that in the next year, more than 400,000 applications might be received for the 85,000 H1B visas. Many of these for non American university educated folks from India who are taking the place of middle skilled Americans. The folks who are educated in the American universities , which happen to be the best in the world, are top notch and need to be kept here. These people perform job functions that are highly skilled and cannot be performed by the cheap labor from India that is flooding in due to the companies like Tata Consultancy and Infosys. This is kicking more and more American educated foreign nationals out of the country, when in fact the regulation needs to be happening in the middle skilled sectors to protect American jobs.\n\nIn conclusion, the OPT extension program needs to be for 36 months instead of 24 to keep the skilled work force here in the US.   \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1330","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rangarajan Thattai Raghunathan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I feel this program uses immigration status to undercut American students and STEM workers.

As we all know, big data period is the next upcoming period which demands huge amount of people with expertise in statistics and engineering. As far as I know, students who are US citizens and major in STEM are far less than the amount demanded by the society. International students with expertise in STEM could satisfy the demand of the society and US doesn't want to miss the big data challenge.\n     2) Shortening OPT STEM extension doesn't necessarily reduce the amount of immigrants, on the other hand, it could potentially increase the number of people who reside in US illegally.  Some international students who couldn't get H1B visa within the two years will try to stay illegally in US and their skills couldn't be utilized as it should be. what a loss!\n     3) Extension of STEM could attract more valuable and skilled international students. Just like the first reason, US is a great country who needs more skilled labor. Extension of STEM could make the COUNTRY strong.\n      Thank you!!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1627","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yang Bai, Inventive Health Clinics"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think a 24-month extension to STEM OPT is actually very necessary. \n\nFrom the student side, we want to have a relatively stable period of time in USA, not worrying about where to go after a short OPT time.

A foreign student here in a STEM curriculum should not be provided ANY US federal, state, or local government assistance whatsoever.  We have thousands of fully capable US CITIZEN and legal immigrant (green card) students that would appreciate the same assistance but because a potential employer of the foreign student would not have to pay their portion of payroll taxes (social security, etc.) the American student is at a major disadvantage in finding employment.  This is totally unacceptable.  The liberal union and government interference that has totally wrecked our K-12 education system in this country now proposes to double down on their ineptitude by importing foreign students to cover any perceived lack of adequately prepared college candidates.  Foreign students should be limited to a small percentage of student enrollment in any college or university receiving any form of government assistance, whether direct or indirect via government backed or generated student loans or grants.  Further, no foreign student should be allowed to receive compensation by any employer unless they agree to pay the full payroll taxes - including that portion usually paid by the employer.  A special social security account number could be assigned to all students in this program so that funds received into that account could be directly applied to the US debt without any benefit to the non citizen student.  This would give the AMERICAN citizen student an employment advantage, which is as it should be in an AMERICAN institution. Further, instead of costing tax dollars, it would help in reducing our historic debt.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3414","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Gilford Berry"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think the USA need STEM major people to help improve the technology industry and also financial engineering industry because they are valuable asset and can create bunch of labor force in the USA.

Clearly, the giant companies in electricity, chemistry, biology are in large need for recruiters for fostering their development, therefore, create more social well-beings by great brains. But the native american workforce in technology field is far from sufficient. All international students who receive top education in the US could provide their insights in their fields through the best education.\n\nSecond, the local job market would not be affected through this policy. As the policy mentioned, STEM is the region to be covered, where a demanding market much bigger than local staff could provide. The extended period of OPT will continuously increase the wealth in the U.S. \n\nConversely, if the opt period is too short, it will not only accumulate the scale of international brains could bring, but case unnecessary inconvenience for US companies. The reform of H-1B visa is yet improved to meet the demand of the market. Therefore, this policy would remit the conflicts in job visas and improve local well-beings.

Most importantly,the United States really takes actions to help foreign educated students and scholars stay here making their contributions. \n\nEach year, there are hundreds of thousands of talented foreign students injected into United States. They have been making tremendous accomplishments in many different fields. As well as receiving substantial training after they finish the graduate work, F-1 students could continue making high-impact progress in science, engineering and technology. \n\nAn F-1 OPT is an optimal strategy that provides graduated students much time and flexibility for their continuous contribution to US. For F-1 holders in academic institutes, 36 months of OPT period is no more than the average time period required for accumulation in production before they go back home countries. Educated by US institutes, some F-1 holders seek to utilizing their skills in industry. A 36 months OPT could just make their transitions a lot of easier. This new policy could also avoid some huge cost for industrial corporations to support H-1 visa because a portion of F-1 holders would like to go back their own countries eventually.\n\nSo why not make the OPT longer?

If the U.S. really \"needs\" foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?  And more importantly, if workers with such training are needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?  There is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\n\nThere is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates. U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary.  And by defining a recent college grad as a student, the DHS takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes (FICA and Medicare taxes) -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.  The OPT workers will cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nOPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.  The real intent of this rule was defined by Senator Charles Grassley in a letter to Obama: \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3722","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Larry Allen"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I completely support the proposal to increase STEM extension period from 17 months to 24 months.

In my opinion this increased duration of practical training is vital for the students to fully utilise the education they have received. Moreover, STEM which typically stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) advanced degrees are areas of utmost importance  to the technological & scientific progress of USA as a nation. And it would be in the best of the interest of the nation to optimise the capabilities of people having advanced degrees in these areas. STEM advanced degrees are very specialised in nature and it takes years of education for a student to gain expertise in these specialised fields. The skill sets required to gain STEM designated education are also very niche. For example, to be able to do Masters in Computer Science the student needs to have, the 4 years duration, engineering undergraduate degree and in his high school as well he/she should have had science & mathematics subjects. Thus, a student typically going for a STEM designated advanced degree has already put in years of education in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics making them competent enough to be further able to gain expertise in these field by going for STEM designated advanced degrees. As such, these students are intellectual assets for the nation which the nation should capitalise for their own advancement and extension of OPT practically means this only.All together, this extension is imperative to maintain this nation's economic , scientific and technological competitiveness.

STEM students, especially \"nerdy Asian STEM grads\" like me with a full score on GRE quantities is a valuable resource and we can be extremely useful in the modern technology world.\n\nPlus, for those Chinese STEMs that prefer the free world like me, it's really important to keep US more competitive than CCP. We're the kind of people that got recruited by CCP and make those aircraft carrier killer missiles, regardless of our free will. Moreover, CCP can easily give a scientist a hard time if he/she refuses its offer. It's just not a good thing to turn down CCP when you're a Chinese citizen, and I DO NOT want to work for them.\n\nPlease make it easy for us to work for you.

The proposed rule would require that the terms and conditions of a STEM OPT student's employment are commensurate with those for similarly situated US workers.\nWhat other US workers can be found who are conducting three year traineeships? This leaves no comparables, and so the employer will pay the least amount of compensation it can and likely no benefits, with the argument that it is \"training\". DHS would not have a viable argument that the company is not meeting the requirement because there are no similarly situated US workers.\n\nThe proposed rule would like to expand the program to include foreign students who obtained STEM degrees (likely outside of the US) but are in the US studying in a non-STEM program, however the extension would only be available to those who seek to develop and utilize stem skills. This seems highly irregular. Prior STEM students may not have been accepted to a US university in their STEM field due to lack of ranking or qualification of their prior university. That selfsame student might come to the US to study business or any other non-related field, and yet still be eligible for a training extension on stale or unqualified skills.\n\nThe proposed rule is particular damaging to US university students and US recent graduates in STEM fields. In the proposed rule it states that, \"hundreds of thousands of international students are currently pursuing courses of studying fields that may provide eligibility for this program\". These students are in the age bracket of 18-28. Each US high school student who intends to study must have an available position at a US university.\nThe current number of foreign students at US universities is circa 700,000. Foreign students make up about 4% of the US post-secondary school population, but the statistics are much higher at the higher ranking schools.\nThis leads to tougher competition forcing the US student into competition for a coveted place. The proposed rule is designed to encourage more foreign students to study at US universities which will only exacerbate the competition. The proposed rule damages the US university student again upon graduation, when those seeking employment in STEM fields are competing with a OPT practical trainee to whom the employer can keep in trainee status with commensurate low pay and little or no benefits for up to three years. Then comes the final blow, when the company, having the OPT completely trained and skilled in the job after three years decides to obtain an H1B or E-visa for that person rather than hiring on the market. The US university student lost both on the initial job opportunity, the training and then the long term job.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2703","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Veronica Hensler"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly support opt extension and support this new rule which extends the extension to 24 months.

Just look at what Disney is doing to American workers as one example of the abuses that are all ready occurring.  America cannot afford this de facto run around of our immigration laws.  It's time to put American workers first, not big business and the Chamber of Commerce who desire cheap labor, free from obamacare taxes and payroll taxes, over American workers.  I agree with and concur with the following statements and quotes from Senator Charles Grassley:\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:\n\n\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3446","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Steve Rainey"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There are many reasons to say NO to this proposed change, but you will hear all of them from others.\n\nJust say NO to this proposed change.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees.\n \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\n \n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\n \n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\n \n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\n \n \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\nRakesh","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2945","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rakesh Ramesh"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" Why are we worried about people out side of this country getting the jobs here before American graduates.

Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3603","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Alice Lowrey"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"At a time when STEM workers in this country are being laid off and replaced with H1B immigrants, I think the question that really needs to be asked is if this bill is going to benefit the citizens of this country, or is it going to benefit big business and the CoC.\n\nWhat this rule proposes is to create more cheap competition in an already wage stagnant field, hence cause more job loss of citizens.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1298","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Alex Molthan"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not know any US company would take advantage of OPT STEM students in such a way to offer lower wages etc. From my own experience and my colleague's, we were treated equally when the hiring manager determined who to hire. In fact, hiring a student on OPT would cost more since if the company needs a long term employee, they have to file H1b petition for the person. I would disagree with the fact that OPT students are taking away jobs from the Americans.\n\nHowever, one important issue I want to point out. USCIS has to implement stricter rules on organizations that take advantage of the H1b program. To illustrate this, I will describe as good as possible. A lot of multinational consulting firms are hiring from overseas where the future employees have no formal US educational background. They would submit H1b petition for those people and bring them here. However, the salary paid to those foreign nationals are way lower than the market rate. These consulting firms are taking advantage of these employees since they want to come here to get green card and the waiting period is typically 5 years so the consulting firm could drain every single cent out of these people for a very long time. This hurts the US job market.\n\nTo emphasize my arguments here, I would like to invite any party to do a research on all the companies that hire students on OPT and submit proof that students on OPT are getting paid less.

I strongly support this policy not only because I can benefit from it, but also because I believe it's the right thing to do for the United States. This policy will greatly consolidate the competitive power of the United States in the hi-tech field, which can therefore benefit enormous American hi-tech companies and their employees. Needless to say, highly trained and skilled tech workers are indispensable part of this booming industry, which has already been and will continue to be the economic engine of this country.\n\nOf course, as we all know, in a diverse society, there's no public policy that can benefit everyone. It requires insight and bravery for the policy makers and all the members of our society to embrace this difficult choice, which is good to the society and the nation in the long term, but will make some people's life harder in the short term. However, this hardness is not caused by unfairness, but merely from fair competition, which is actually, in my opinion, the sole of free market and free economy, the faith of American people, and the reason many of those who gave up everything they had in their native country came here for. Members of WashTech, stop wining about new comers taking away the jobs, expand your knowledge, sharpen your skills and man up!

They face ever increasing competition from overseas businesses who take advantage of the H1 program and spam thousands of temporary workers into America who only mean to stay for a short amount of time (<5 years or the duration of their H1's). International students however, have already assimilated to the American way of life and overwhelmingly decide to stay in the country for a longer period of time.

I got my masters degree in Engineering from a large public university. I learnt a great deal during my schooling in the US and had the good fortune to be taught by world renowned scientists. \n\nI remember towards the end of my degree, I along with few other grad students and post-docs were attending a meeting to review recent research results from a visiting professors lab. We had unending questions about the results and were politely but relentlessly questioning the visiting professor. My professor proudly pointed to us and said to the visiting professor \"look at how critical these young researchers are of the material you presented, they don't accept the material at face value and have learned to think like scientists\". I realized at that moment that slowly, without even realizing it, under the careful, critical and tireless tutelage of my professors, my mind had finally opened and begun to process information like a scientists' should. \n\nAfter graduating, I applied for the OPT visa and started working at a company that manufactures very complex scientific equipment. My master's thesis was based on this equipment and this role provided me the opportunity to understand more about the physics, applications and inner workings of this technology. \n\nI know for a fact that I had not displaced any US citizens by taking up my current job and this position was open for months before I applied and was hired. \n\nMy educational background, engineering skills and aptitude have proven to be very valuable for the company I work for and I have been a highly contributing employee thus far.  I have had very supportive and experienced mentors who have continuously trained and guided me. I have learnt more working alongside my fellow engineers than I could have learnt in a university setting. \n\nMoreover many of the soft skills that I picked up at my job are the foundation of having a successful lifelong career in engineering. I learned to apply my skills in an environment where teamwork, dealing with customers, collaborators and outside competition was just as important as getting the right answers. \n\nHaving the 12 months OPT and 24 months STEM extension in my opinion is absolutely crucial for engineering roles where technologies evolve so quickly that what is learned in universities is outdated by the time we graduate. \n\nInternships do help in getting some practical experience but to become an effective engineer we need to be involved in developing enterprise scale projects which take years of continuous effort. Internships generally provide opportunities to work on small projects that can be completed in 3-6 months.\n\nUnfortunately my 17 month OPT period ends in mid-December and it seems unlikely that the 24 month STEM extension rule would be finalized before then. \n\nI urge you to please consider allowing students who have recently completed their 17 month STEM extension and are currently in their 60 day grace period to apply for the balance 7 months extension. \n\nThough I have learnt a great deal about one instrument, my training is still incomplete and I have not even begun to get trained on the highly complex equipment we supply to synchrotron labs around the world. This rule would provide students like me an invaluable opportunity to complete projects we started working on years ago. Though I have learnt a great deal about one instrument, my training is still incomplete and I have not even begun to work on the highly complex equipment we supply to synchrotron labs around the world. \n\nIf I had to suddenly leave, my company would have to scramble to hire someone in my place. The projects I am working on could be delayed for months before someone with suitable skills and experience can be found and brought up to speed. This rule would provide students like me an invaluable opportunity to complete projects we started working on years ago. \n\nMany thanks for your time and consideration.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2523","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Rachna Parwani"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First of all, I wish it could be passed. \n\nI think it's important to U.S economic marketing. the technology company hire those STEAM student to create fancy product for america. those product helped american citizen easier life, and make more job opportunity for people. think about it, if there are lot of products like iPhone. what will happen? then those company will hire a lot of sales, they will build more store like apple store.  and more labor will be hired for construction. then they need more marital for constriction,  then they need driver to shipping ..............\n\nKeep a country develop depends on high cut edge technology company, knowledge, core technology. \n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1637","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Jeff Zhang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After those weeks of stress where we did not know what our future in the United States would be, this rule is a welcome change.

A major problem is that this rule would provide superior help to students who are not American citizens, assistance which is not available to American students.  This discrimination is unconscionable.  Effectively the federal government would be taking better care of non-Americans than it does of American students.  A further result of such action is that it discourages American students and will surely drive many into other and probably less lucrative professions.  So this disadvantages the American student, but it also disadvantages the American employer and the American economy.\n\nThere is another problem:  why are we doing this?  There is no shortage of STEM workers or graduates in the U.S.  And the federal government's first obligation (or at least it should be) is to support Americans and American students.  Our immigration policies should be focused on actions that support the American people and the American economy.  When there is no shortage of STEM workers, it is unfair to American taxpayers to advance a program that has no marginal benefit to the country or to Americans.  So the whole premise of the program is faulty.\n\nThe OPT program has denied Americans 430,000 jobs from 2009 to 2013.  Such disloyalty to American workers is unconscionable.  But the disloyalty to Americans doesn't stop there.  This program has been funded from the Social Security Trust Fund and the Medicare Trust Fund, sources unrelated to the intent of the program, and trust funds that are in trouble financially as it is.  Bottom line is that we cannot afford to deplete these funds particularly for a program unrelated to the Funds primary intent and because it adds to the burden placed on American taxpayers to deliver these programs.  In the case of Social Security, American workers have already contributed to the Social Security Trust Fund and the government has a financial obligation to those workers.  By depleting the fund for other purposes, the government aggravates an existing financial shortfall.\n\nFurther discrimination against American workers results because this program provides a source of workers whom American employers can hire more cheaply.  Though this may help American employers, it does so penalizing American workers and American graduates.  Bottom line, rather than expanding this program, it should be eliminated altogether so long as it clearly hurts Americans rather than helping them.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3568","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Ronald Pierce"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"its good to here that stem opt rule has been extended from 17 months to 24 months this help so many international student to improve their skills and knowledge in there stream ..this is good rule and by that our govt revenue will be incensed so i recommended to be with extension rule ..thank u    ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Karunakar K."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the change of OPT extension to 24 months as this provides great training opportunity for all STEM graduates helping them make use of their course work.

Actually, most of them are working hard and making great progress. And I didn't feel OPT extension lower the average salary. The reality is the opposite. Most tech companies are offering higher and higher salaries every year to recruit talented engineers etc., who will make the most contribution to the US's economy.

The current regulatory changes apply to non-immigrant  graduates that seek to gain experience in the U.S. tech workforce.  If those who make this decision called for in ICEB-2015-0002-0011 are in possession of evidence that extending this rule will truly support the well being and strength of the United States then I will leave it to them.\nMy concern is that, despite the provisions stated in sections G, H and I, the overstaffing of STEM workers will continue to drive American citizens out of jobs that will almost surely be staffed by STEM workers. And extending the time they are allowed to stay in such a capacity only prolongs the  pain of tech workers like myself.\n\nIn summary, I was born in the U.S.A. and graduated from an American university in 2011 with a technical degree after years of student loans and working part-time. Since then I have been able to get some work in the tech field. But as I look around at the majority of workers in a 350 person facility, I see that over 75% of the workers are Indian or Chinese. They do prove to be very proficient at what they do. But they are still there, and I am not. I am quite capable of providing value and excellence in my chosen field, but as long as this unequal distribution of foreign born tech workers persists, I might as well go back to school and try a different career.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2544","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Tom P."},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am respectfully urging those in the capacity to change this shocking law.  \nIt is already damaging job placement for Americans.

Please note the following comments.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III A] I support the proposal by DHS to reinstate the OPT STEM Extension in response to the judgment issued on August 12, 2015 by the U.S. District Court in the case of Washington Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security. I further hope that the final rule, following the period of public comments and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), will be published at least 60 days before the date of vacatur indicated in the courts judgment, i.e., the final rule be published in the Federal Register 60 days before February 12, 2016. This would allow time for review by Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), so that the final rule will take effect by February 12, 2016. \n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] Though I support the proposal by DHS to increase the period of OPT STEM Extension from 17 months to 24 months. I think this should be increased to 36 months instead of 24. Given the appalling state of the work permit process; this would greatly help students in STEM, the US Companies employing them and the US economy. After all, a majority of patents and publications come from international students. \n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] The proposed rule by DHS requires students and employers to implement a formal Mentoring and Training Plan that would be submitted to the Designated School Official (DSO) before the OPT STEM Extension is granted. Further, every six months, the student is required to provide the DSO with an evaluation of his or her progress towards the training goals agreed upon. While this requirement is made in good faith, I note that there could be several reasons due to which the training goals might change. For example, the employing company might stop working on a project that was expected to increase the participating students STEM skills, and instead, request him or her to work on different project of similar nature. Therefore, the Mentoring and Training Plan must not require the student and employer to be overly specific regarding the training goals, and how progress towards them would be measured, because the projects and opportunities provided to the student might evolve or change with time.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] I support the proposal by DHS to include the 2008 Interim Final Rules (73 FR 18944) Cap-Gap provision, under which the DHS would temporarily extend an F-1 students duration of status and any current employment authorization if the student is a beneficiary of a timely filed H1-B petition and requests a change of status.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B] I believe the transitional measure should be extended to all STEM students whose current STEM Extension is set to expire close to the vacatur date of Feb 12, 2016. This can be done by allowing those who are in grace period after the current STEM extension ends to request for extension of the remaining 7 months for a total of 24 months or the remaining 19 for the total of 36 months. This would greatly help the students, the US companies employing them and the economy! \n.\n\nTo summarize, I strongly support this proposed regulation, and hope that it will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register in a timely manner, without incorporating significant changes. I note that if the final rule does not take effect before the date of vacatur of the current 17-month OPT STEM Extension, up to 34,000 students who are currently taking advantage of this provision will be forced to resign from the current employment and depart the United States. \n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0688","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Manny Ramaswamy, Ford Motor Company"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the proposed rule that expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all Eligible F-1 students.

Extending STEM OPT will also create an even larger pressure in the H1B lottery process because a lot of people whose OPT would have expired now get extended and they will remain in the pool for H1B lottery. Year over year, the chance of getting an H1B will be slighter and slighter, and employees may become reluctant to employ STEM students to avoid the risk of losing an experienced employee three years later. Extending STEM OPT is also unfair to non-STEM degree holders who fight equally as hard, or even harder, to stay in the U.S. if the United States cannot be fair to everyone and provide equal chance to everyone,  how can it entitle itself as a country of freedom? A lot of non-STEM students are equally valuable as STEM students, and they are forced to leave the country without even getting a sense of what American Dream is all about. So if STEM OPT were to get extended, the same, or similar extension should be provided to non-STEM students, or the H1B cap should be raised.

For instance, one student got a job offer from a company. However, he didn't get his H-1b visa because of the low rate (only 1 out 4 can get the visa last year). If there is no OPT extension, this company will lost the person they spend a lot of time and effort to hire, not because of this person not behaving good at work (most of the time, the person will be a hard worker), just because of the unfair OPT policy. It will influence a lot of American companies and make them wasting time and money. Finally, I don't think expanding OPT for F-1 student will hurt their American people's employment rate.

If some USA citizen are not qualified for the job, they should NOT get the job, they have no reason to blame the international student. Actually, lots of companies does not hire international student, just because of the visa status, will the discommemder regard this as bias to international student?  Therefore the OPT extension is totally fair, otherwise the discrimination will long live and do harm to USA.

Since the H1B cap remains the same and the number of applicants are increasing exponentially, the companies that has hired STEM degree holders will lose experienced candidates. The number of applicants in 2015 for H1b was 233,000 with a limit of only 85000 people getting the H1B. So it's like 1 in 3 people got the H1B Visa. Having a total of 36 months of OPT gives the STEM degree holder 3 chances to try the H1B application. I feel the DHS needs to revisit the STEM extension period depending on the number of H1B applicants. DHS should increase the STEM extension to 36 months if there are 340,000 H1B applicants, 48 months if there are 425,000 H1B applicants and so on. So the rule needs a constant update to keep a balance between the number of H1B applications, number of H1B Visas granted and the number of months of OPT for a STEM degree holder.\n\nAs of now, I strongly support the proposed rule and would like the rule to be implemented soon so that STEM holders can take the advantage.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1740","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Dushyanth Bhojaraja"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support for extending STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months and capgap relief.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0593","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Narendra Ambati"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"STEM OPT will benefit the United States in terms of economic, social and cultural integration. Economically, International students have contributed largely to schools' income from which the schools are sustained.Country's such as Saudi Arabia and many African countries send their students to the U.S because it is considered a leader in research, science and technology. This might be developed from the testimony of people who study in the U.S and have the opportunity to overcome the shortcoming of a traditional classroom teaching through the development of real life experience that OPT offers. However, since the most attractive fields of study for international students are in STEM area, the one year time frame is not enough to give graduates the much needed time to fully develop their skills. If this STEM OPT is implemented and expanded, student will get the chance to overcome time barrier and go back home fully prepared which will serve as an advertisement for prospective students discerning schooling abroad.

Students PAY for their education and that should include any such periods of time of such hands-on training they get any where within the USA. The fees involved in such advanced training should at least equal any standard school year costs in one of our Universities in the same state such training is intended. ie: IF it costs $57,000 dollars for one year \"masters degree\" level work at Cornell Univ; then, the student should pay this amount to such an \"employer\" since this is truly a training function - NOT A PAYING JOB... IF NOT, then this is a work visa only and NOT some form of a student visa!\n\nThe loss of revenue into the FICA/SSI funds due to this special status is unwarranted at best, and unconstitutional at worse. Such loop holes must be rewritten at once or the entire regulation must be rescinded from consideration!\n\nYour lack of ability to track and/or account for ALL such students within the USA is the basis for many of our security problems today. Until you can actually demonstrate such tracking, in real time and without more than 2% leakage or loss of accurate data, then NO FURTHER such visas should be issued, or extended !... Any such loss of location/actions/employment data information, ie: you can't contact one of these \"students\" within a 24 hr period, is grounds for deportation upon following contact!... Until you can control all of these persons in our nation, you should be looking to add more or extend stays!\n\nI do expect a response to these points, in writing.

Studies have shown that there not a shortage of STEM workers, but rather a they are actually undervalued by companies who do not want to pay a reasonable wage for their services. Extending the OTP program plays into this desire to pay low wages and increase competition in a field already dominated by people willing to work cheaply for the sole purpose of staying in the country. The OPT program is used to circumvent the H-1B requirements, minimal as they are.\n\nThe OPT and H-1B program are also used by companies to offshore jobs. It is in the best interest of the government to keep jobs in the United States to increase the tax base and keep it's citizens employed. the vast majority of jobs that go off shore never come back.\n\nI sincerely hope that ICE and the DHS drop the idea of expanding the OPT program and return it to it's original levels, or drop the program altogether. There are already plenty of programs that can be used to keep exceptional foreign students in the country.

My reasons are many, but I can summarize my primary reasons rather quickly.  We currently have a sever problem in this country with unemployed and more to the point under employed American workers.  This problem is particularly acute in the information technology sector.  My son in law received training in this field and was near the top of his class, however he has not been able to find employment in this field since completing his training some seven years ago.\n\nThe son of a close friend graduated from Texas A&M four years ago near the top of his class with a degree in information technology and he has been unable to find an entry level full time position in his chosen field.  He spends his time as an underemployed IT consultant setting up systems for small company's on a part time basis.\n\nBoth of the individuals I have given as my examples are struggling, due in part to our government's inexplicable policy of importing citizens of other countries rather than attempting to employ our own work force.\n\nI think our government should insure that all of our students who are citizens are gainfully employed before we attempt to implement a policy like the one proposed.  And lastly, I would like to point out that major policy changes like the proposed regulations should be passed as a law by the congress, and not an expansion or convoluted interpretation of existing regulations.\n\nThank you for considering my comments.\n\n\nAlbert Crain","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3201","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Albert Crain"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please expand the OPT:-D","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1001","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Sylvia Zheng"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If the U.S. indeed needs the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?

More and more STEM students are applying for h1b right now, which makes it much harder to be chosen than a few years ago when 17-month extension came out. So I think it is reasonable to change that old rules and extend OPT time to 24 months based on current trend.\n\n(2) We international STEM students make a grate contribution to American engineer field. This can be proven by the percentage of international students and works in STEM field both in industrial field and on campus. What impact will be if more than half of us have to leave this country because of the reclaim of STEM extension rules? Do you think places like silicon valley can still function well?\n\n(3) We have already sacrifice a lot to achieve STEM degrees so we deserve better. Not to say other degrees are easier but we STEM students do spend more of our times on endless homework and   projects. We even need to sharp our skills during leisure times. Otherwise we may not get a good GPA because the tests are so hard. These takes us too much times on finding a job or an intern. So we need more time after we graduate to make up the lost time.\n\n(4) We STEM need more time to gain experience in industry field. For STEM students, if you want to do a good job in industry, you have to spend hours and hours for practicing in real industry. Only after that, can we really improve ourselves. That is why this new extension is so important to us.

This proposal does not help the United States or the workers of the United States\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. \n\nSenator Charles Grassley has said that the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\nAttorney John Miano has said that the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis believes that on a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO has said that \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\nMr. Trumpka continues \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\nTrumpka believes that \"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nIan Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute concludes \"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.\"\n\"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\n\nDHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n\n\"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\"\n\"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\nI have only included only a few of the arguments against this proposed program. The arguments against this proposal are numerous and strong. This proposal does not help the United States or the workers of the United States. I propose that we give incentives to companies and colleges to train American students and workers to fill any void in these and all other workplace  fields.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3194","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Janelle Furstinger"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We need this extension to work out in order to make the best of our study abroad experience.

Let me start to give you a little bit of introduction of myself. I came to USA three years ago because my husband is a phD student here. I did not plan to work here at first and the reason I came here is to take care of my husband, so he could do better on his own study. However, I found that Americans love learning new stuff and always talked about starting a dream is never too late after I lived here for three years. Besides, many of my American friends encouraged me to apply for a new master degree and tried to find a job in America after. Therefore, I did apply for a master program and got admission.\n\nI got to say, I love the university here. The professors are very nice and I learned a lot of professional skills and other fun stuff about American culture. I truly believe what I have learned is going to make America and Americans better in the future, not in a very huge way, but definitely make this country better.\n\nSo I think the extension of OPT to 24 months or even longer is necessary and the best thing for America, which is a great way for America attracting more professionals to stay here. People go to work and their hard efforts will yield some valuable results for ordinary Americans, which is a win-win.\n\nIn the end, thank you again for reading my comment and have a great day.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2280","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Lily Zhu"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is an outrage for American workers.

I'm completely against the proposed change.\n\nHere are some reason this is just a bad policy.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff (cont.):\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:\n\n\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\nAnd finally:\n\"One of the big education pushes in the United States is to increase STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education and create a workforce better suited to the jobs available in the modern era. Even schools that are not dedicated STEM schools are pushed to increase their STEM education, and other communities have gotten together to create STEM initiatives to supplement education.\"\nBut DHS' proposed rule \"is pushing the ones raised and trained at home out of the job market that we created these education initiatives for and handing those jobs to students who have no ties to the U.S. other than their education.\"\n\nThis idea should be dead on arrival.\nSincerely,\nWalter Babigian ","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3687","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Walter Babigian"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months.

We provide a valuable education and make them bright students and let them leave to create business opportunities on other countries? Instead we should keep the talent within the county and give them a chance to create more opportunities within the nation.  \n\nBut, this new rule putting more responsibilities on the employer who is gonna hire a OPT student in terms of providing a proof related to training and mentoring etc...

Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa. \nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3796","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Steven Sun"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Improving and extending training opportunities for International nonimmigrant student is very IMPORTANT!!\nThe need for such an extension is specially for those international student who is able to employed by US employees.

Also not to forget the amount of paperwork that will need to be dealt with for providing the information to college about the mentoring and training program. Although training is important, may be for the first year of OPT it makes sense, but when we apply for extension, I am not sure how training would matter because most of the times we would already be trained in a year and start working independently to gain hands on experience and that way we learn better and try to push ourselves to be more productive and innovative.\n3. Why can't the already existing rule be applied with only the increase in duration? The college anyway approves STEM OPT extension based on employment in the STEM field.  \n\nMay be some changes in the mentoring and training program can be done in the rule so that it benefits both the employers and the STEM students.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2521","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Anonymous"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The proposed rule should not be accepted nor implemented:\n\nThe proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.\nThe proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.\nExpanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands.

I also have arguments why the rule is in the best interest of both the US workers and international students. My points are as follows:\n\n1) Several comments argued that the OPT extension increases competition for US workers. But anyone with an analytical mind will see that its actually the contrary. Research shows that every foreign-born graduate with an advanced STEM degree is associated with, on average, 2.6 jobs for American workers(link: https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/06/16/urgency-immigration-reform-attracting-world-s-best-and-brightest). A cultural trend in the country that I am coming from is that the top students in the class study in the STEM filed, and the best of them come to study abroad. Moreover, almost all the OPT students in my STEM field were valedictorians of their school in their home country. What I mean to say is that these STEM students are filtered after tremendous competition and therefore highly motivated, energetic and innovative. I have seen examples of several companies that were established based on an innovation by a STEM Ph.D. student that led to the employment of several natives.\n\n2) As a Ph.D. student in Circuit Design, I personally trained many undergraduate US students and guided them to accomplish their project. All of them have grown passion for the field and are hired by companies based on their circuit skills. A lot of my colleagues did the same to high school US students, some of whom later joined the STEM program. Therefore, the approach by DHS to educate international STEM students has both way benefits in complex ways that might not be immediately apparent.\n\n3) One might argue that OPT itself should be enough for all the benefits above, why do we need the extension? STEM fields are getting extremely complicated and even though the students have the capacity, its not possible to learn the practical aspects of the filed in school due to the lack of opportunities and time constraints. After hiring, generally it takes more than an year for the companies to train a student. So, if the OPT is not extended, then the student will have to leave the company as soon as he/she is ready to contribute. Therefore, I think that OPT extension is a smart approach by DHS to allow both parties enough time to benefit mutually from the relationship.  \n\n4) This point about the additional requirements in the extended rule. I think DHS aptly handled the issue of competition by demanding the commensurate status of the position. I also think that mentoring is necessary for OPT students to achieve their goal. But I think that the requirement of hard documentation for mentoring and training (paragraph no.: 80 FR 63387) should be relaxed. Please note that the training of STEM students is an automatic process guided by the success factor of both the company and the student. Most of the time, the training in industry occurs informally through discussions, design reviews and question answer sessions, which are hard to document. Since this is the first time most of the employers and also the DSO will encounter such review process, I suggest to allow back-and-forth communication between DSO and student/employer to determine whether the extension requirement is met. In other words, the the OPT extension request should not be rejected right away without allowing such negotiation about the training program.

The Regulation deflect the issue away from this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world. Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student\".\n\nThis logic is flawed, when a student is employed by a company, he/she is an employee and will be judged in the same category as US workers. There is no \"apple vs orange\" comparison. Also, if a similarly situated US worker is not found, that exactly proves the student's skills are very in need and this should further qualify his/her employment. Also, as an international student working in US worker, I have at least three US colleagues that perform similar work as I did and earn similar salaries as I do. Saying \"no similarly situated  US worker can be found\" is very wrong\n\n2)Secondly, I have question about the mentoring program:\n\n For the mentoring program, there should be better guidelines about what it is. what kind of document shall  be submitted? is there any difference between the mentoring program and a working plan for an employee? Is it practical or meaningful to have such a mentoring program? As an employee in US company, we know that employees should be proactive. My manager do not have the obligation to tell me exactly what I shall do. I need to find work and ask questions by myself instead of being assigned with \"mentoring\"\n\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2471","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Yi Shi"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think it is necessary to extend the STEM OPT time to 36 months in total.

Also, this rule will play an important role to ensure the competitiveness of U.S. universities that will attract more talented students to the U.S. As a postdoc researcher, I myself have trained both undergraduate and graduate students along my study, many of which decided to continue pursuing scientific or engineering study.

These are the students that come to the United States and study inside the country, and get degrees inside the country. They are a value asset that the US invested in. These students want to invest back into the country. From my experience, they all look for jobs in the same way as any other American citizen does, they go through absolutely the same interview process and are exposed to the same benefits as American citizens - the wage difference is a myth that is being perpetuated by parties not familiar with the subject. There is no problem with \"fairness\" - every single international student goes through the same exact process as any American to get employed, but with ten times more restrictions. Whoever mentioned that it is just a matter of hiring foreign workers for cheap labor is, once again - not aware of the process to get a work authorization. Coming to the United States on an F-1 visa, pay out-of-state tuition, combined with international fees, limited amount of on and off-campus employment, restrictions for work hours - all these are the things international students are already going through that no American student does. If on top of that, they are passionate and talented enough to apply for high-skill jobs, and get them - America cannot afford to lose those students.\n\nThe future Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs - all of them are there. Every single international STEM student that I got the honor to meet over the past couple of years showed tremendous work ethic, dedication and most of all - appreciation for what the United States has to offer. These are the people that gave up on a lot to come to the US and study - study in fields that are by no means trivial. Major innovators in this country were all immigrants or descendants of immigrants - it's time we look past someone's origin and more at their abilities and willingness to do great work.\n\nUnited States was always known as a global economy. This country has more impact worldwide than any other nation. This means that to maintain that status, we need global talent. Enrollment in STEM degrees goes up, but graduation rates in the same areas do not. Every year there is a fixed number of students with advanced degrees that graduate, but not nearly at a fast enough rate to fill all positions. There is an extremely high-demand for top-skill jobs that are going unfilled. Not because of wages, but because of lack of skilled enough individuals. This is why it should be US' top interest to ensure that it can retain those who have those skills, and more so - grew those skills at universities across the country.\n\nI urge you to pass this legislation to ensure that United States remains a country that can innovate and produce technology that benefits the entire world.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2746","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Den Delimarsky"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The new 24 months STEM extention will help both students and employers in USA.Thank you DHS.","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-1918","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Silpa Muppalla"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep my talented international friends here and supporting our country's economy!","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2475","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Mahima Venkatesh"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Expanding  the period will be helpful  in improving students' practical skills.

And as their competitors, they need to work harder, improve themselves to make sure they are not bet by these foreign fresh grads.\n\nThese students are contributed to this country, they are elites from all over the world, why not bring them to our society?\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-0209","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Duan Jiang"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"International students are grateful to the country for giving the opportunity to get quality study .We would like to to be able to contribute back and of course gain practical experience.I support the 24 month OPT extension","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-2125","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by Vibha Ghatke"},{"agencyAcronym":"ICEB","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is similar to the H1-B visa program which I.C.E of Homeland Security refuses to enforce. Homeland Security is a useless ineffectual branch of the government that does not deport foreigners with expired H1-B visas. I was told this fact by an I.C.E officer in San Antonio, TX\n\nI greatly oppose any action of this kind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \nThe H1-B program is America's Trojan Horse. The fact Rubio (whose parents were foreigners - Cubans) supports the taking away/giving away jobs from Americans, making more of us unemployed is the ultimate of wrong.. \n\nThis position shows how massively out of touch Rubio and his cohorts in the government are regarding the replacing of Americans with foreigners. The U.S. unemployment isn't the government lie of 5.5%, but closer to 25% for unemployed and grossly underemployed Americans. \n\nI have personally had to train some of these people so I could turn over work at the end of a contract (they aren't necessarily trained as government supporters contend). In 2002, I witnessed a company go thru 3 foreigners before they found an American accompanied by a foreigner to satisfy the performing of a technical task. \n\nTheir unspoken goal is to control all of the world's Information Technology. The group that controls all of the world's technology can control the world. They have access to your personal bank, insurance and numerous other accounts.\n\nThe tenure of these people in this country is supposed to be an initial 3 years with a \"possible\" extension of another 3 years (for a total of 6 years). The government does not police those who have expired visas and deport these Federal law breakers. \n\nIt is estimated, there are over one million of these people in country with expired visas taking jobs from unemployed Americans. Rubio wants to triple the visa cap? Does Rubio have a foreign bank account that is being filled with rupees?? \n\nAfter all, our government is patterned after that of ancient Rome, where military over-extension, the devaluing of their currency (removal of precious metal content from coinage), bribes and corruption brought about Rome's downfall. I vote for someone-else, who wants to \"make America great again\". \n\nThere needs to be a government bounty placed on these law breakers to clean-up our country. American workers within companies could easily identify who needs to go. Some have bragged about being in country over 13 years. \n\nI have identified some that have been in country since 1998. Some of the offenses perpetrated by these people is the assumption of American names (so they can hide from being detected). \n\nThey will group together and speak in their native language. They do this gathered at the coffee pot while Americans are hard at work. They may be talking among themselves to solve a deficiency one of them have, or they may be discussing how they are going to take over the world's I.T. \n\nI once had a contract with one of the foreign companies, their foreign supervisor, wanted me to displace two American employees within their client company. Rarely will a foreign I.T. company hire an American. The one where I worked placed me into a special sub-company. A view of their org chart showed an Anglo at the top with most of the level 2 and 3 positions being filled by foreigners.\n","docketId":"ICEB-2015-0002","docketTitle":"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"ICEB-2015-0002-3787","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":true,"postedDate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"1653-AA72","title":"Comment Submitted by James Anderson"}],"totalNumRecords":3864}

If America wants to keep the top position in the world, she has to keep the best talented people in the world.\n\n2. OPT brings competition, which keeps local companies active and give people motivation to work. Not like European countries, America respect the creation of individuals and doesn't charge a high tax rate from the people who are building this country to pay the people who do nothing but earning the benefit from others tax. That's the encouragement for people to work, because there are competitions, and companies can get the real talented people working for them. People object OPT, and claim foreigners rob their job opportunities, a question rise in my mind: if two equally good people are competing one position, one is a foreigner, the other is an American, most companies will choose the American with no hesitate. Then why foreigners can rob the job opportunities?

Currently the H1B is so hard to be chosed and approved, the OPT extension is really very important for us foreign students to stay in America legally.\n2. Lots of high technique companies born in America, these companies need lots of related employees for their development. We international students are the potential employees for these companies. Someones argue that international students will make native Americans lose jobs, while this is not fair. Companies will only choose the right persons who have the abilities of managing the job. Event there exist no International students, native Americans who are not fit for the jobs won't get the jobs either. While without enough employees, companies will struggle for their continue development. And also the original employees will bare a lot of pressure, since they will have to undertake too much work since the short of employees.\n3. International students have brought diversities to America, which is really very important for America. America itself is a country of diversities, when looks back to the history of America, this is also true. It's impossible for America to develop without people from different locations in the world. International students will bring prosperous for America. Americans shall have a long views of their country's future.

With the absence of a comprehensive immigration reform, this is an essential way to ensure that US keep the best brains of world. \n\nThe STEM students are widely regarded as the most creative group of people. Keeping these highly talented people is not only the key to keep America technologically competitive, but also critical for the economy. The Silicon Valley is the best example. Thousands of jobs are created because these young and energetic fellows have the knowledge, the ingenuity as well as the will to start the next big thing.\n\nA particular group of people would be mostly affected by the OPT extension, the Science and Mathematics PhDs. It generally takes about 6-9 month for Science and Math PhDs to get a job in academia. Without the OPT extension, it is almost certain that these Science and Math PhDs would have to leave the country, which would be a huge gift for their home countries, as US trained these PhDs for free. \n\nIt is tempting to ignore the benefits of the OPT and H1B visa program and simply cry that 'immigrants are taking our jobs', especially during the election seasons. The truth is that the STEM students help to create far more jobs and jobs in the high end. Even Mr. Trump said he wanted to bring the talented people in, legally -- STEM students are among the most talented -- it seems to me that extending the STEM OPT (also the H1B visa) is only right thing to do. \n\nFurthermore, a self-inflicted brain drain would only benefit other countries. In my area, physics, it can be seen that about 50% ads in Nature and Science, the best journals in the area, are recruiting ads from Chinese institutes. China is literally buying brains. In fact, in our field, heavy ion physics, it is well recognized that China is the next big player beyond 2020. Similarly, India is also catching up. I find this is a general trend across academia and possibly industry. Part of the reason is that international students often find themselves stuck in the immigration limbo. Therefore, US need to move fast and extend the OPT as well as the H1B visa as soon as possible.

Foreign students and workers have huge positive impact on local economy. After they come to US, they need to rent house, go to restaurant, buy ATT or T-mobile plan, go to travel, buy commercial products like Mac, iphone and cars. This would boost local economy.\n\n3. After graduation, it is government's responsibility to keep the talent engineers staying in US rather than pushing them out. See what a fierce combat we have today for talent people. Companies like Baidu, Alibaba come to US to hire people back to China. Facebook, Amazon and Google go to China and India to hire people. Singapore forces high school students to work there for at least 6 years after graduating, if they want to be considered as a candidate for their Universities.\n\n4.

Second, since there has been a shortage of skilled workers in US labor market, the OPT extension will provide labor to the needed industries. As the labor shortage is alleviated, it is foreseeable that the overall productivity will go up and industry is expanding, which in the end is good for not only the immigrant workers but for native workers as well! Again, those F-1 students are in their early ages. They are not using much of the social services provided by the government. They are contributing part of their income for tax revenues.

OPT students are NOT illegal immigrates. OPT students have legal status and they are economically independent, which both the universities and government required proof before issuing visa. OPT students are not fed by US government!\n\n2. OPT students pay taxes! International students pay less tax than citizens while on OPT, but once they change their visa status to work visas like H or L visa they pay the SAME taxes like every citizen, even if they do not enjoy as many rights.Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nMy support for the proposal is based on the following reasons:\n1. The extension of OPT is NOT equivalent to giving out jobs to international students for free! OPT students are required to seek employment on their own and they are given a deadline of 3 months to secure a job. OPT students are also given less job opportunities because only a few tech companies are willing to hire international STEM students. OPT students have jobs because they earn the jobs through competition. \n\n2. OPT students are NOT stealing jobs from citizens. US needs skilled and well-educated STEM work force to stay on top at STEM fields, stimulate tech company growth and create MORE JOBS! The extend of OPT attracts more talented young professionals from diverse backgrounds to join the STEM field, develop the business and CREATE MORE JOBS. It is just wrong to deprive the international students the opportunity to work in the job they got through fair competition after US has been benefiting from their contributions.

Some of my reasons for opposing are thus enclosed.\n\nOPT has already given 433,000 jobs to foreign student/workers, while leaving American workers looking for jobs.  Under the\nproposed rules, more than 270,000 students will qualify = 700,000.\n\nTHE OPT PROPOSAL DOES NOT GIVE PRIORITY TO AMERICAN STUDENTS.  We are promoting STEM studies in our\nschools and colleges, only for our students to be pushed out of tech fields by employers who favor foreign student/workers.\n\nThe OPT Regulations DO NOT specify unusually bright foreign students/workers .  Just any foreign student/worker is eligible\nfor any of our schools, K - graduate school.\n\nThe OPT program is actually an EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM !!!!!!!!!!  The program allows a foreign student to change to an\nH-1B visa, whether he/she has a degree or experience.  Therefore, the student is eligible to replace an American worker.\nUS STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.\n\nThe OPT program is an economic advantage to employers and foreign students only.  Bonuses of $10,000 to $12,000 will be paid to the employers for hiring foreign STEM students.  The employer is, thus, encouraged to hire a F-1 student before a green card holder, or a citizen.\n\nThe Social Security Trust Fund has already been shorted $1B  per year, because the recent foreign grads are still considered students and do not pay into the fund.  ANOTHER REASON FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO WANT TO HIRE\nOPT STUDENTS.\n\nThere are many regulations that are vague and ambiguous, and are slanted in favor of the foreign student/workers.\nFor example, the regulations allow the employer to hire uneducated and inexperienced foreign students, even though\nthe regulations describe the employer as hiring highly skilled student workers.  THE EMPLOYER, THEREFORE, CAN\nHIRE FOREIGN STUDENT/WORKERS WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIn light of unrestricted hiring and vague regulation of the OPT program, there are no safeguards and protections for\nAmerican student/workers.\n\nOPT regulations are unenforceable, again, in favor or the foreign student/workers.  There are no provisions to notify DHS \nregarding fraud, or penalties for employer violations.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THERE ARE PROVISIONS TO CHECK IF\nFOREIGN STUDENTS ARE PROTECTED, BUT NOT US STUDENTS !!!!!!!!!\n\nExistence and expansion of the OPT program creates a work world which is illegal and unfair for my grandchildren and\ngreat-grandchildren.

Extension is a good way for attracting students learning in U.S and contributing in U.S. As a F-1 student learning Statistics, I feel deeply that one of the reasons that make me want to apply for the program in U.S is the OPT extension. As we know, the H1B lottery is held every April, for students graduated who do not find jobs offering H1B or do not find jobs, OPT extension is the only way that they can have more time to keep staying in the U.S. Other developed countries, like UK, only allow foreign students one year to stay, so most of the students studying in UK I know, they come back to China after their study. As for master degree, most of the courses are aimed to preparing students to enter the industry, the easiest way is to find jobs in local. If only one year after graduation is permitted and no extension, I think most of the students may return to their own country after graduation, for now, some of my Chinese friends choose to build their career in China since there're more opportunities than before. In the future, STEM students may not even consider going to U.S to study further if they have less chance of working here longer. That'll be a great loss for both U.S university & industry. The reason why there's a classification between STEM and other majors is just because STEM majors can make more contribution in leading industries like technology. Since H1B now is a good policy to limit the number of immigrators, keeping the extension is a good way to attract more intelligent people coming to U.S and making contributions in U.S.\n\n2. Extension is good for competition, and competition is a good thing for country development. With extension, foreign people and local people will compete in finding jobs, serving in industry, ... etc. Employers will have more opportunity to select suitable employees from more candidates. Though competition may not be good for people themselves (there'll always be people lost their jobs), but it is good for the country development and it will always encourage people to improve their own skills.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoran Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15995", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "If we don't give international students training opportunities to work in the U.S., many of them may not be coming to study here.

Firstly, international students save a lot of US universities from financial crisis by the tuition payment. Meanwhile, these foreign students stimulate the country's rental market, restaurants, travel and automobile industry by the international students' consumption. All these consumption boosts the US economy. Secondly, STEM students have made great contributions to this nation's innovations and breakthroughs in science and technology. American students only account for a really small amount of the entire STEM students. Positions in STEM are faced with challenges to be only filled up with US citizens. International students fill the hole for native students to work in industries like science and engineering to keep US research and development still leading the world. Due to the OPT extension, companies can hire an international employee easier and longer which creates more profits for the technology industry by their professional and technical skills. A lot of projects or research in STEM need 3 to 5 years to be completed. If the OPT were cancelled, these STEM F-1 students would have to leave in a short time. This would add the cost of training and hiring for enterprises and research institutions. Since the H-1B lottery becomes overloaded, the new approval will offer more opportunities for the employers' to maintain these demanded STEM talents. Last but not the least, this new policy would definitely increase the impact of the US around the globe. See countries such as UK, Britain, Germany, France, Australia and China.

The reason that United States is the most powerful country in science and technology fields is that opportunities and policies here attracts smartest technical people from all over the world to work here, and contribute their expertise. If we only have 12 months for those students to find an technical internship and work for that internship, the contribution they can made in their field is minimized.\n\nNow I'm working as a intern in a mathematic modeling team. I can tell that in the first 12 months, companies are investing money and resource to help their technical interns to adapt to their environment and learn the tools they will use. So, interns are actually making contribution to the team after this learning period. If we only have 12 months for internship, before those technical companies can benefit from their international interns, we already have to leave this country. However, if we have 24 months STEM, situation can be different. Each technical international students can contribute their expertise for at least two years! Think about growing speed of technology. With two more years, we can help United States develop thousands of ground breaking technologies.\n\nUnited States is now the leading power in many technical research fields, which can benefit all human beings on this planet. The power of international technical students, who are studying here and working here can accelerate those researches with no doubt. I can understand some United States citizens are complaining that international technical students make them feel harder to find a job. However, if now we force those talented international engineers to quit what they are studying here and stop them from contribute to the whole human being, we need a better excuse than fair job opportunities.\n\nTalking about fair opportunities, when I'm looking for jobs, I can see most of the jobs here only recruit United States Citizens. International students are not the reason that you can not find a job. Instead, they are trying very hard to get some tough technical jobs, which are not very popular to United Citizens.\n\nExtending the STEM, you will have more technical students working for this country and contribute to the world. Stoping it will not help you find a job. Instead, United States will lose the most important power they have in their Science and Technology fields.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tong Niu, Washington University in St. Louis", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16171", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM extension is a great tool and excellent opportunity for the US administration to help its high end technological skill needs and research.

My graduate school receives too few US domestic applicants each year; and a good portion of the few US students it enrolls each year drops out eventually because they think STEM is \"too hard\".\n\n(2) When I was in my last year of my PhD I was touched by many head hunters both from US and China; I did not even hunt for a job. I finally got several offers and received one half a year before my graduation. This company even need to counter offer another offer I got from a Chinese company. Apparently the industry nowadays have a huge appetite for students in my field which can not be satisfied by the US citizen labor force. If those companies can find equally competent citizen candidates, they would not spend so much more time and efforts to look for people like me which not only requires high salary but also request them to sponsor working visa.\n\n(3) So far as I learnt, only e-verify companies are eligible to sponsor OPT extension.

There are many reasons for this. \n\nThe first and most important one is that the development of the U.S. economics is very much relied on those students graduate from STEM degrees. For example, most of the technology companies in the U.S. prefer to hire those high educated international graduate students from STEM majors who are very professional and familiar with the techniques and skills and also very committed to their jobs, and can make great contribution to the company with relatively lower salary within 2-3 years of working. Without those intelligent students, those companies will not be very competitive in the future which will absolutely block the development of the U.S. economics.\n\nThe second reason is that extending the OPT time for STEM F1-students doesn't effect the job opportunities of the native Americans. Those intelligent students from STEM or other majors with lots of mew and novel ideas may creat more job opportunities for the native Americans. For example, if a technology company hires a student from computer sciences, this student thinks of a new idea of developing a new software. Then the company may need to hire more people to work on it such as testing the software, selling, and technique training and so on. A lots of examples can be seen from those big companies.\n\nThe third reason is that those students also contribute to our daily life. As the society develops, no one can live without science and technology. A creative idea, a great invention, a scientific theory may change every common people's life. For example, some people say that there is a fourth form of water and this kind of water can improve plant growth and improve human body immunity. Without those STEM students and scientists who work on it and figure it out, many people will be fooled and willing to buy those unknown water.\n\nIn summary, canceling or shortening the OPT time is an unwise decision in the modern rapidly developing society. Vice versa, the government need to try hard to keep those high educated students from STEM who will make great contribution to the development of the whole U.S. economics and society.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Nikki Xiang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15433", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposed rule.\n\n1.

The reasons are as following:\n\n1. There is no doubt that a working class with high education is good for any society. It is also true for the United States of American. Well educated people bring extra values to the whole country by contributing expertise and intellectual properties. Most importantly, knowledge does not discriminate against nationalities. It doesn't change the value a person may contribute by the place he or she was born. All the STEM students are with college degrees, master degrees and some with PhD degrees. They are specially trained for years in certain field. No one can deny the power of education.\n\n2. US is lack of working forces in the industries who need STEM students, especially for high-tech companies. There are not enough US citizens to work for a job that requires expertise in computer science, math, science, engineering and other technologies. International STEM students is a very good solution to this problem. Just simply look at the number of employers who used to be international students in silicon valley, people would know how important to give international STEM students the chance to work in the US.\n\n3. 12 months OPT is not enough for most of the STEM students. Once you graduate, there is time between you graduate and start the job, usually several months. The time to apply for H1(the working visa) starts from April every year and the process also takes several months. A 12 month OPT basically means that every international STEM students only has at most one chance for getting the working visa. Since there has been an increasing number of applicants in the past two to three years, without the extension, a large portion of them have to leave the country a year after the graduation. This is not fair, and definitely not the ideal scenario for the country.\n\nI am currently a STEM student and working towards my PhD degree. I would like to have the opportunity to return to the country what I have learned in my PhD. And 12 month OPT decrease the chance significantly. \n\nI sincerely believe that the 24 months of OPT extension is a very reasonable proposal. It will make everyone's life easier, including  both the international students and the US citizens.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chen Wang, New York University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20336", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I fully support this proposed rule. This proposed rule will confirm and expand the OPT STEM extension for international students. That will definitely benefits the STEM international students, but they are not the only part getting values from it.\n\nThe opportunity to gain field-related working experience in the US has been one of the most appealing benefits to international students, which keeps the universities and colleges in the US attracting in the international education marketplace to compete with other countries.\n\nIn such a world of globalization and competition today, the US, a nation claiming for freedom and equality, who always pursues advancement, can't, shouldn't and won't limit the human resources to only domestic workers. Talents are the key to development. Education is an effective way to attract talents from all over the world to the US, and OPT STEM extension serves for this goal as a valuable advantage of US education.\n\nOPT students has been an important source of human resources especially for technology companies. For the employers, the OPT period allows them to evaluate the employed international students in the working environment, and that process will require a certain amount of time. Besides, employers usually spend a period of time as well as other resources to train a new employee. It's not efficient to hire an employee for such a short period as one year (the original OPT period). A longer OPT period will allow those employees to actually produce values to the employers, and to the industries and the economy of the US.\n\nExpanding the extension does let the international STEM students stay longer, but it is still and always an non-immigrant working permission. It can't be compared to \"green card\" and it won't evolve into that. It makes the international students more competitive than themselves without the extension, but it doesn't mean to make domestic students any less competitive. The international students being more competitive brings positive competition to the job market and academic areas, encouraging both international and domestic students to improve themselves.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xinying Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22146", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a international student that has been studied in us for more than  four years, I see abundant of advantages to allow more foreigners works in the us. \n1.

I used to be an international student major in computer science in the US and now I am back in China. The rule will be good for the US government, the US citizen, the US companies as well as the economy of the state.\n\nThe extension will make the US academic institution more attractive and competitive compared with other institutions in other countries. For most of the International students who study in the US, most of them pay more tuition fees than study in European or Asian countries. The reason for them to pay a higher education fee is the OPT extension with which they can latter work in a US company and have enough time to find a suitable job for their career. The huge tuition fees they paid will make the institutions run smoothly at the background that most states governments cut off the expenditure for higher education institutions. On the contrary, the English institution used to be the best in the world. However, due to the problems of internship and work visa, less international students choose to study there, which further cause the economic problems. Without the OPT extension, the current depressed English institution status will occur in the US. \n\nThe rule will on the other hand reduce the number of undesired immigration. Now more and more Chinese students choose to go back to China for the huge job market there. Before going back, most of them want to have a work experience. The OPT extension give them the chance to gain working experience in enough time. After the extension time, they would choose to go back or stay. Only those best suitable for the US would choose to stay because those who cannot do good to the society and the state also couldnt find a good job to support their stay in the US. Hence, the extension became a selection period, like Darwin's law of natural selection, for the state to select the best desirable people to keep staying. In a word, the extension will give most international students enough time to gain work experience after that most of them would go back and the most needed ones for the US will choose to stay, which will reduce undesirable immigration.\n\nMoreover, the extension will be beneficial for the US economy. The IT companies in the US contribute a lot to the American economy. And international STEM students are a major work force in these companies. Whats more, the extension will attract more international students to the US as I mentioned above, their study in the US will pay the tuition bill, rent house, shop for daily use etc., which actually be beneficial to the states economy.\n\nAll in all, the extension will be a win-win strategy for both the US and the international students. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yihan Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16269", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please accept this comment on the rule proposed b y the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT).

Just 11 years later, Robin's own company, Baidu, issued public offering on NASDAQ just 11 year later on 2005. On 2010, Baidu had its research center located in California.

And I strongly support this new OPT extension rule for the following reasons:\n1. Education institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. A huge amount of international students will consider the OPT extension when they decide whether to pursue a degree in U.S or some other countries such as Canada, Japan of Germany. A friend of mine studying Electrical Engineering decided to go to Japan to pursue a master degree because he was afraid the 17 months OPT extension was definitely too short to finish a proper project in any well-know national lab. So the 24 months OPT extension will attract more intelligent international students and better ensure that the U.S academic sector can remain competitive globally.\n\n2.Foreign students have regularly contributed a significant amount of money into U.S economy through the payment of tuition, living expenses, and many other ways. In addition, when students are on OPT extension, they pay more money on rents, food, transportation and so on. Just as shown in the report: $16.7 billion from 2013-2014. Also, the tuition of an international student in any school is normally 2 to 3 times higher than the local students, which means that the school benefit a lot from foreign students and use the excessive money to improve the education environment for local students which will attract more local students. Longer OPT extension will definitely attract more international students to put their money in U.S. university.\n\n3.Students who are on OPT extensions are definitely NOT stealing positions from local Americans. Indicated by federal laws, companies have to pay more on international employees and sign on a contract indicating they could not find any suitable Americans for certain positions and they had no choice but to hire an international employee. STEM positions usually have very high requirements such as being talented and highly educated. Not a lot of people could satisfy those requirements. The cancellation of OPT extension will be a disaster for those companies who have such positions. They cannot hire those who are unemployed for a replacement since the unemployed for a replacement people can never fulfill the requirements for these positions, because if they could, they would be hired before the international students.\n\nTherefore, regardless the passing or cancellation of this rule, the unemployed people will remain unemployed.\n\nHence, I strongly support the rule and hope to see it benefits millions of us.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tiantong Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19048", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new OPT policy, which is helpful in many perspectives. \n\n1.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nZhao Cheng", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhao Cheng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4551", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a foreign student myself, of course I support this proposal :D\nI am not going to talk about \"american dreams\" but just take a look at http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf\nyou might notice that \"The Fortune 500 companies that boast immigrant or\nchildren-of-immigrant founders have combined revenues of $4.2 trillion. $1.7 trillion of\nthat amount comes just from the companies founded by immigrants.\" Immigrants do make huge contributions.\n\nI looked into those opposed reviews and find mostly they are emotional complains and says that \"US government puts foreign students over US citizens\".\n\nThis is really ridiculous to me, just look at those companies at your career fair, how many of them could support visa sponsorship?

There is a huge demanding for the high level graduate students from these majors, however, just take a quick glance at the compositions in courses such as computer science, electronic engineering, etc., it is obvious that quite few students are really US citizens. Take my class for example, there are 59 master students majoring at Computer Science in my school, however, only 2 of them are owning the US Citizenship. Can you really imagine that the companies can hire sufficient labor only from US citizens? Do a simple math, or even comparison between the figure of the students majoring at STEM and having US citizenship, and the figure that the employees the companies need, the answer is obvious. \n\nThere is an opinion that the companies can pay less to hire the foreign students. However, there is no evidence to support this at all. The real reason that the companies are willing to hire more STEM studens is simply because the companies have no many choices. As well known, the salaries for the computer science major students are even higher for the STEM students than those US Citizens. Usually, the US citizens are not quite willing to take these difficult majors. Also take my company for example, it is an American company, however, there is no US citizen in my company, simply because we could not find any US citizens with such skills. \n\nWell, another reason, all people around world understand the essence of US--Freedom, and refuse to this propose is so ridiculous to happen in the US. Even though, I bet that every one has to admit that the most important factor for a coutry to develop is technology, which is developed by well educated people. Just imagine that the STEM students failed to work in the USA, what would they do? Almost for sure, they will go back to their own country, such as China, India, Korean, etc., and work for their local companies. Then, will this be a great deal for the USA? Do you want to have another version of FACEBOOK and GOOGLE developed by the STEM stduents in China or India? At least, these huge companies, FACEBOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER, AMAZON, etc. who hired, are hiring and will hire more and more STEM students, can make a huge amount of taxes and other contribution to the world, as well as the American Culture. Beyond this, more and more talented and skilled persons will be scary to move to the USA, since they would think that the USA government does not cherish knowledge and skill at all. \n\nIt is also very short-sight to decline this proposal, just to have more jobs available for US citiznes. The taxes and revenue created by these companies can in turn create more and more jobs for all people, including US citiznes. \n\nBesides above, there are many other reasons that I don't have time and space to express here.\n\nI really appreciate that the government would take my opinions into consideration.

First, if both an U.S. Citizen and an international STEM candidate are qualified and powerful candidates for a tech position, a company will still prefer to hire the citizen. Second, the new policy will benefit MORE U.S. citizens in fields other than STEM because in those fields less employers will be willing to sponsor H1b visa to the international candidates. They know that the total amount of H1b visa will not change, but the probability of STEM major winning the H1b visa increases. That basically lowers the probability that non-STEM majors winning the lottery, which makes less of the employers willing to take the risk. In other words, this policy is actually gaining more work opportunities to citizens from all the non-STEM fields, which have lot more job opportunities than STEM fields. Obviously, this policy is not only a way to attract more STEM experts from all over the world to maintain the countries' tech global position, but it also will benefit the citizens by saving more non-STEM job opportunities to them.

Training is inalienable to learning. Through training, a student is able to practice what he or she learns from the class. Training is the bridge that connect real world problems and ivory tower theories and equations. But training takes time. With this rule, international students will have a good opportunity to practice what he learned, thus explore the value of American higher education to the maximum.\nSecond, this rule will also attract more students from all over the world, thus add diversity to the American higher education. Expanding the training opportunities for international students will be attractive for those who are intelligent, hard working but can't afford the high tuition fees. They now have a good chance to save enough money during their training period to cover their tuition fees. This rule will also attract those who will be afraid that a short training period is useless in their career paths. The total training period of three years will sure help them learn how the industry works better than they one year training period. This rule will also attract those who are afraid they can't stay at U.S longer enough to fully appreciate the greatness of the American society. This rule will help them gain a good impression and give them long enough time to make friends among Americans. When they return to their home country, they can be \"ambassadors\" of the American higher education, the American society and American companies. \nLast, I am not unaware that there are some comments regarding this rule as a threat to Americans' working opportunities. However, the working opportunities are not fixed, but varying. With more students, there are more need for food, houses, cars and services. This will create more working opportunities.

I don't think the decision makers should be kidnapped simply by the so called employment rate of technical native workers. Once OPT is limited within 12 month without extension, the huge amount of STEM students will reconsider whether it is worthy to pay high tuition and living expenses to study in America without a long enough time to practice their skills learned here. There are many negative results of this. \n\nThe first and most direct is economy impact. Huge amount of international students generate a huge amount of GDP by paying tuition, renting and daily expenses, which also support the employment of related areas. It is so hard to deny that once the number of international students decrease, the employment rate of these areas won't be affected. \n\nSecondly, the whole technical industry will definitely face a severe shortage of talented young technical workers with good education looking for entry level job without too high salary requirement. We all know that young talents are the treasure of tech firms, they are creative, energetic and most importantly, they won't cost too much of tech firms to hire them. So once they are gone due to the policy change, tech firms will have to raise their cost to compete for the native technical workers. On the other hand, native students and technical workers may not study and work as hard as before. As we know, the pressure of getting hired is one of the motivation that students and young workers fighting. The decrease of STEM students will also decrease their pressure because it will be much easier to find a technical job once the competition becomes much less severe. So the firms pay more than before and end up hiring workers not skilled as before. Is this a problem? Without any doubt, in the long run the leading technical firms in America will see the decreasing competition worldwide. \n\nOne more thing, now all the other countries around the world are making tempting policies to prompt their students come back to their home from USA so they can make contribution to their own country. Even from the perspective of keeping international competition position, the American government should not send these students back before they make enough contribution here.\n\nSo I regard those native technical workers are the people only considering their own interest without thinking in a high level for the interest of whole American industry.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for re-instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to re-institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nSridhar Reddy Voruganti", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sridhar Reddy Voruganti", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5482", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "the  new revision is consistent with the goal of increasing employment opportunity and a faster economy recovery.

The average \ntuition per year they spend is $30,000. Totally U.S. education system \nreceives 400,000 * 30,000 = 12,000,000,000 = 12 billion USD per year. One of the \nmost important reasons they choose U.S. for higher education is \nbecause it provides the best after-school training opportunity (17 months \nSTEM OPT). If U.S. education system can not provide STEP OPT extension in \nthe future. It will lose in the competition against other countries that are\nproviding it. Considering that a large portion of STEM students will \nabandon their future plan to study in U.S. That is a huge impact on the \ncurrent U.S. education ecosystem that has already adapted to wide \ninternationalization.\n\nSecond, it is required 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.\n\n3 years OPT training provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school \ntraining. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college\ngraduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years \nresidency period of medical school graduates).\n\nThird, STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. H1B \ndoes. Don't blame at the wrong thing.\n\nMany have the misunderstanding that OPT students are taking away job \nopportunities that belongs to U.S. citizens or residents. That is completely WRONG. OPT/\nSTEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education. The \nOPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted\nto H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local \nresidents. According to 2015 data. Among the filed 215000 H1B applicants, \nonly 30000 (less than 13%) are STEM OPT students. The results of 2015 H1B \napproval also shows that only less than 15% of the approvals are given to \nOPT students, the rest are granted to workers that are imported from other \ncountries directly. If government want to control foreign workers and keep \nmore jobs to local residents. The right thing is to issue a H1B policy \nchange. Revoking STEM OPT will do very little to help. \n\nOn the other hand. U.S. government has imposed many restrictions on STEM OPT\nstudents. For example, the total unemployed time during OPT cannot be \nlonger than 90 days, they can only work for e-verified companies, which is a\nsmall portion of the job market, etc. Burdened by these immigration \npolicies, it is already an unfair job hunting game and they have no way to \nbe as competitive in many aspects as an equally good U.S. resident. If a \nforeign student finally wins a job out from such a competition, that means \nhe/she is outstanding and is the person that this country needs. DHS is very\nconsiderate on STEM OPT rule making and tuning to make the rule benefit the\nU.S. national interests. People who are blaming with no-brainer should go \nback and read the rules more carefully. Job doesn't grow on trees. It is not\nlike we drive all foreigners away from this country then you'll enjoy the \nleft over. It can be outsourced if capitalism fails to gain expected profit \nmargin from local. The right way to make everyone to have a job is to \nbringing in outstanding people. They'll implement great ideas, make new \nproducts and open lots, lots of jobs, so many examples around us such as \nSatya Nadella, Sundar Pichai. You probably know the reason of China Qing \nDynasty began to fall in late 1800. Yes, because it refused to open to the \nworld.

Big companies recruit foreign guys because there are not enough qualified guys among native workers, not because they have bias on foreign students.\n\nIn conclusion, the OPT program has nothing to do with those people who cannot find a job. For those who cannot find a job, I suggest U.S. government, create more job opportunities in other fields, and I suggest those folks complaining, please improve yourself.

For example, in the computer science department, the portion of international students can be more than 90%. Those international students have contributed so much in U.S. Technologies and economics. This is also a major reason why U.S. can be lead in the world's technology today. \n\n1 For short term:\nBig IT companies rely on so much on international students. Americans who can do the work are far from enough. If the OPT extension is gone, there will be a disaster for those companies. And the direct effect would be that, those companies have to outsource their work to workers in other countries. This would be a great loss of the tax income of U.S.\n\nBesides, losing those talented international students will make our current big IT companies less competitive. Since the internet is an open world, they will be quickly replaced by their competitors in other countries. For example, China already has some big IT companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, etc. If we lose our talents, we will die soon. As technology companies contribute so much in the US economy, it will have a consequential effect on all economic systems in U.S. Possiblely cause another big depression. Then we cannot imagine how many Americans will lose jobs.\n\n2. For long term:\nIf we do not give an OPT extension for those STEM students, they would choose some other countries such as European countries to do graduate research. This, in the long term, U.S. won't be a lead country in both technology and economics.\n\nAfter all, U.S. is an open country that accepts all who love this country and would do contribution to this country.\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Daniel Robbins", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20869", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I fully support this proposal.

The US education systems have put effort and time on developing the F-1 Students' knowledge and background. In addition, it takes time and effort from the American employment company to train the F-1 students to be capable of doing things in their own field of study in the reality. One year of OPT is not enough to let the F-1 students have accomplishment in industry, since they, and similarly, American freshmen, would need half to one year to familiar themselves with the industry logistics, business mode, marketing strategy, etc. Therefore, it is beneficial to allow F-1 Student working longer in the US to make contribution to the country based on what they have learned from the universities and industry.\n\n2. F-1 Students can bring different ideas or creativity into the industry. As a food technologist, I came from an Asian Country with my own comprehension on food and cuisine. When I develop formulas of food, I would like to involve the edge cutting international flavor concepts which is also what the marketing is looking for now in work. Some of the international flavor concepts were chosen by my marketing team as potentials to be introduced to the customers. In addition, more and more international flavors have shown up in our daily life, which cannot be omitted when you doing a grocery shopping for food.\n\n3. Although there is competition between F-1 students and Americans, it might not be a bad thing. The competition can trigger the Americans to work harder and develop themselves better to fit into this environment locally and globally. Competition makes people know themselves better as a mirror. In addition, some of the open positions just cannot be filled by appropriate local candidates so that they are taken by F-1 students because of their special talents and expertise in field of study.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chen Du", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18639", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "First of all, I definitely support the rules. I have read through many of the negative comments and found most of them are nonsense, some of which sound ridiculous.\n\n1. \"We have too many STEM american students are out of jobs\". Accodring to a recent report from CNN (http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/06/news/economy/jobs-report-october/) the US unemployment rate is as low as 5% right now, the lowest since 2008. Therefore this claim ( and it seems that people just copy it from other places and used it here without even thinking about it) is not even true in the first place. \n\n2. Even if the unemployment rate is somewhat high. I am sure most of people out of jobs are non-tech persons, because as a tech person myself, I know that in the recent years, tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. are hiring more and more people. That said, even if international students are forced to leave USA because of this absurd reason, these tech companies will not hire someone from the unemployed group who is not qualified at all.\n\n3. \"This new rule will give companies incentives to hire cheaper foreign worker, instead of americans\". This is even more meaningless. Students who benefit from OPT are all from good universities, most of whom have advanced degrees like masters or PhDs. If they are hired, they will be hired by big tech companies. They will earn much more than american's average salary. A PhD at Google can earn as much as $200,000 yearly, a master can earn $150,000. \n\n4. If this new rule couldn't be issued due to those absurd negative comments. Most of the tech companies will lose thousands and thousands of talented workers by this coming February.  You have to admit today's USA economy depends highly on these tech companies. Unless US government is willing to see another major economical crisis in the near future, I don't think they will not allow this new rule to be issued.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

Rather, it is an opportunity for STEM foreign students to gain valuable experience before they return home. I know a lot of my friends who simply do not want to apply for working visa at all (namely, the H1B visa), and they want to work in the US for 2 years as a way to sharpen their skills before they return to China. Because nowadays, a foreign degree simply does not make you more competitive in the job market in China. An average MIT or Stanford graduate might earn $100,000 a year when they graduate in the US, but in China, you only get paid $30,000 ~ $40,000 if you get the same job as, say, a software engineer, and you get more competitions for each job opening. Therefore companies nowadays value experience more than degree in China, and OPT extension is a great way for international students to gain such experience.\n\nSecond, the argument seems to be worried about the social welfare being cut by the government. BUT please be aware that foreign students are making GREAT contributions to the U.S. weary economy, and the economy could only be worse without international influx of cash.\n\nLet me show you why this is true.\n\nI will take me myself as an example. I got my bachelor's degree as a computer engineering major in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a top-5 school in engineering in the US. For international students, the tuition is  $18,000 per semester, so this would total to $36,000 a year. If you also considering living expenses (which definitely contribute to the local real estates, restaurants and even automobiles industry), this number could add up to $45,000 to $80,000 depending on individuals. To keep things simple, let's just assume it is $50,000 each year for an average international student (And REMEMBER, I am not considering private schools and top-20 schools which are far more expensive than University of Illinois).\n\nWhat is the total for a bachelor's degree in 4 years?\n\n$200,000. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.\n\nI am assuming this number is definitely much more than average US families could support (I know that, you know that, and the GOVT knows that more clearly than we do). And also be aware that international students typically do not get funding or scholarships unless they are doing their Master's or PhD's. That means all these money come from OURSELVES.\n\nHow many Chinese students are right now in the US? According to this website:\n\nhttp://www.iie.org/Services/Project-Atlas/United-States/International-Students-In-US\n\nThe number is 274,439 in year 2013-2014. How much money would these students contribute to the US economy? I think after you do the math, you will understand why that 4 billion cut is a joke. Yes, it is a JOKE. And yes, I haven't included international students from other foreign countries at all. Consider how much welfares that could be, consider how much jobs that could create. This undoubtedly do more good than harm to the US.\n\nWhat we ask, is simply a fair chance to gain some training in the US after we completed our degrees. I think this is a very fair request, and I think we deserve it. We are making much more contributions to the US economy than average American tax payers.

Before attending Kansas, I received my M.S. in physics at a school in a department where at least 40% of the graduate students were foreign.

I worked in agricultural research for 10 years and worked for 15 years in medical and health research.

I was top of my consulting class, the capstone class for the MS in statistics.  \n\nMuch of my job competition comes from the 75% of my fellow statistics students who were non-citizens.  Faculty want to hire workers at 50% time to avoid paying benefits, or they want to hire full-time non-citizens avoiding payments for social security and avoiding payments for Medicare.  Hiring a non-citizen on a non-immigrant visa leaves the worker vulnerable so the hires will easily relinquish their right to authorship, another unfair attraction to employers.  \n\nThe MS in statistics program has not changed appreciatively since I graduated in 2004, but I now have 10 years more experience than the current graduates.

We should be aware of several facts here: 1. The percentage of the local US students and the unemployed US citizen of STEM is obviously much lower than the other fields. This means that even if we do not provide the OPT extension to those international students, It's not going to help anyway. Those unemployed US citizen or new graduates are competing much more with each other instead of with those international students. 2 Oppositely, If we do not extend the OPT which means there will be much less students working for the high tech companies (most of them they are US companies) at any point of time. Someone may argue that the H1-B are the same and it's nothing to do with the OPT, but you should also be aware of that if OPT is more 36 months which means even if he/she can not get an H1-B eventually, he/she can still work for those US companies for about 3 years which lead an optimized 3 times more students than what it is without the OPT extend. This will also do good to the US economy and then to other industries which are exactly what the US citizens and fresh graduates are looking for.\nIn a word, the OPT extension is good for both the US government, the US citizens and the international students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Will Stephen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5981", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I would like to oppose the OPT rule because due this rule it invites lot of fraud process in the system. It helps lot of Indian INC companies i.e. companies with CEO'S mainly Indians to find an illegal way to cheat the system and i would like to tell you how and what is happening currently with lot of OPT students at least to 60% of students that are being currently recruited and placed. Please read it and understand the cheating that's happening right now: 1. The consultancy recruits OPT students by a simple process without an interview either by cold calling or by referrals and almost every company has a guest house where students are being accommodated providing food and shelter for a short period of time until they gets placed(yes i am referring to placed because even though you are recruited by the company you will be never paid until you get a contract job with client - as OPT have a rule that they can be given unpaid training every consultancy says that it is legal);. Upto this there is no big fraud or cheating that happening with the system from next step everything is illegal, unethical and unlawful.2. In the meanwhile he will be asked what kind of technology he is interested in and the consultancy will give guidance as in which technology has good job market billing rate and how he can easily get a job, will the job be easy or hard with fake experience etc. so then according to the nature the consultant/student selects the technology and consultancy will give training to consultant form then. Note: Please understand that the term training that i referred is not exact training way they will give to consultants/students. The trainer teaches basic concepts in technology and will mainly train he/she to how to survive in the job with 8-10 years of fake experience and will assure consultants that he will be taking the phone interview call for the consultant/student and will also makes a deal that he will be providing job support during consultant job which is unethical i.e. student after his office or during his office will either screen share or will be communicating his office work with trainer there by breaking the office confidentiality code. Trainer does the work for him according to consultant inputs for initial days until the consultant learns his work in his office. For this the trainer or the job backup will be paid hourly or monthly by the consultant. 2. Every consultant who have been hired in OPT will be given a sample fake resume after his training which has atleast 8-10 YEARS of experience to give him an idea how an experienced resume looks like and will be advised to make a resume that shall look like a sample fake resume that has been given to consultant. 3. The consultant/student in OPT agrees to it and then prepares a resume with fake resume which includes client names and company names, years that he has worked which in reality he has never worked on. Then the client names the he puts on the resume is carefully reviewed by consultancy and consultancy will make sure that at least first 2 clients that they put have some body in the client's location either full time or contractor that consultancy knows. The reason for that is to provide job reference when client recruiter asks about reference from his previous jobs  4. Then after the resume is prepared with fake years of experience with fake clients they which here the consultancy markets the resume with their marketing team with fake resumes. Thus the fake resume goes into markets with the consultant details and google voice number almost all the consultants will be advised to have a google voice number in their resume instead of personal numbers which is left to you to decide for what they are doing like that 5.So then the fake resume goes to a prime vendor where the vendor calls the consultant  to verify his job responsibilities, so now the consultant will be well prepared with his fake resume as in how to speak when a vendor calls, so when the vendor calls the consultant the consultant will keep his fake resume in front and talks to him in that fake resume way. Then if the vendor feels good in the phone then he will forward that to main client recruiter/manager. 6. So this is the main step, so when consultant gets the interview confirmation with client manager he then calls his back up or calls his consultancy to arrange a backup. So if it is a phone interview then the consultant will put a call forwarding to the backup resource who will be taking the call for the consultancy thus inviting unethical activity. SO the consultant will forward his fake resume and details to back up so that back up will speak to client manager accordingly and thus gets paid if the consultant gets a job after the interview call as he helped consultant which will be paid by consultancy. Then the consultant if selected will be sent to that client\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Suresh Naresh", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2869", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "24-month extension is NECESSARY, especially for advanced degree graduates.

This rule can retain more talents to improve the economy of America, and hence will BENEFIT EVERYONE. I saw some comments saying that this policy would be a detriment to American tech workers, because this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. BUT I have to say I am not agree with that opinion. Economy of a country is like a pie. It has never been that some people are afraid of sharing this small pie with others. What we should do is absorbing more skilled people to make the pie bigger and bigger, so that everyone can get more pieces of pie. \n\n2. The extension rule can help American education system absorb more wonderful international students to study in America, and hence improve the competitiveness of the American education around the world. As an international STEM student, I chose to study in America two years ago, because I can work there for 29 months with my OPT. This extension policy is a very important point to absorb international students. Because one year is not enough for us to gain job experience. If U.S. cancelled that extension, she will lose a great amount of students resource. If we cannot get any benefit after graduation in America, why not choose other countries? So I think OPT extension can make Education of America more competitive!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yun Cao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22172", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the OPT extension.\n1. If this policy is abandoned suddenly, this would be a disaster to many big companies ranging from wall street finance to silicon valley tech companies. Every year these companies need to recruit large amount of excellent new graduate students. Take me for example, I work in financial model group in one famous financial company in New York City. There are some excellent international employee in my department who graduate from top level university like Columbia University, Upenn. They are the best people from the world: India, Dubai, China, Euro. They all work hard to make contribution to the company and US. I think if international students is good enough and diligent, they would also bring huge value to the company. On the contrast, the competition between local American students and international students could make thole society beneficial. This competition rule chooses better people to the better position, making people working hard and be smart. That's why I do not understand why our local citizen students fear competition. The company could run better if they have enough resources to recruit good people. OPT extension is obviously the foundation.      \n\n2. Universities, research center and many companies would benefit from the OPT extension policy. For university, this policy is made to attract world best people. And it works very successfully. It make American education different to other countries. Because of OPT extension policy and good quality education, many best students choose to come to US to achieve their personal goal.On the other hand, international students also make great contribution to the development of our country. Many of huge tech companies like Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple are not short of asian people ranging from new graduate software engineer to CEO. They are all necessary components of silicon valley making the US machine running faster and faster. For companies, If students work hard and could bring more revenue to the company, why would we expel them? How could we force then leaving to their countries, give them the ability to surpass US? \n\n3. I know many of selfish and short sighted local people hold the thought that they are making people difficult to find a job. That's ridiculous. On one hand, many of international students open their own company in US. For example, Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja. They are all asian people. Marvell is a fabless semiconductor company and ships more than one billion integrated circuits (known as \"chips\") per year. Its market segments include high volume storage, mobile and wireless, networking, consumer, and digital entertainment. This company has 7000 employee. There are also many successful US companies which are found by international students. Besides, US , even whole world has large amount of need to excellent scholar and engineer. The reason they complain about OPT, international students, difficulty in finding jobs is that they are not excellent enough. \nI believe our country, US is land full of dreams. We could find decent jobs, achieve our personal goal by studying hard and working hard. If you own good knowledge and skills, why do you have difficulty in finding a job?

Without the STEM extension, it would be more difficult for international students to get proper training opportunities after graduation. It would no doubt discourage future international students to apply for U.S. universities and I believe cross-cultural discussion and brainstorm is one of the most valuable part in U.S. universities, especially in this age of globalization. \n\n2.

Banks and IT companies have large demand for talent every year and good competition can help make sure the quality of the talent entering into the business.

After receiving an enriching education, it only makes sense to provide a prolonged period of training for the graduated students, to then put their knowledge and skills to use to benefit US firms and their productivity.\n\nThough one might counter-argue that such an influx of foreign nationals will flood the STEM job market and put unnecessary pressure on new graduates not on an F1 visa, I think this worry is not merited. Employers will continue to seek only the best students available. When new hires apply on an OPT, more new graduates for the employers to choose from can only benefit them, as a larger pool of excelling students is available to them. In other words, those who aren't 'good enough' to make the cut for a STEM position will continue to be out of the running, while fierce competition at the top will continue as well--just as it has always been. In fact, as I personally work in a STEM field, I believe it is the competition that drives innovation--if you don't keep up the good work, someone else certainly will become more innovative and advanced.\n\nFinally, an OPT extension provides a good recovery system for the rampant fraudulent applications of H1B visas in the past few years (where naturally, some fraudulent applications ended up being granted the visas). In the past few years, there has been the case where an applicant would pay a 'cover-case' company to submit an H1B application on their behalf (such companies do not do any real 'business', just take a fee from the applicant and submit an H1B application). Thus, some applicants without a real employer, and thus a rightful claim to an H1B, would be granted an H1B visa fraudulently based on the H1B lottery system. An extended OPT can draw out the recovery time from mis-granting so many H1Bs, and also provides extended time to cut down on such fraudulent behavior as well.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe this policy is a beneficial and fair policy for both foreign nationals stuck in the quagmire of pursuing the American dream, as well as for the economy and productivity of US firms.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by YQ Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14676", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support  that the extension opportunities for international students with STEM degrees can be Passed!

This rule would definitely help me, and it can even further help my wife who was also not selected at H-1B lottery this year. Her OPT STEM extension expires in December 2015 and I was hoping this rule, which gives her 7 more months of OPT, will be implemented sooner allowing her to have one more chance at H-1B. I would like to further suggest changing this rule in a way such that people like my wife who will potentially be in the 60-day grace period after expiration of OPT status (Feb 2015 for my wife) would also be able to use this extension. This will give them another chance to apply for H-1B and keep contributing to American economy. My wife was awarded her master's degree in a microbiology-molecular biology combined program from University of Minnesota- Twin Cities and she is currently working as a scientist in a leading diagnostic company. She works on projects that will be making real difference for patients not just in America but all over the world. She would have to stop working in December even though she has a published thesis and years of experience. Only other alternative we have is both of us leave US and rebuild our future elsewhere.\n \nAnother reason that this rule should be implemented as soon as possible is the number of applications submitted for H-1B are getting higher and higher (more than 220,000 in 2015). This leads to a significant decrease in the chances of students, who have spent years here studying and honing their skills, getting a H-1B visa. It is difficult to understand the point of sending away highly skilled workers who were educated here and are already well-versed and immersed with the US culture, and instead bringing in lesser skilled foreign educated workers every year though H-1Bs. Especially the students who spent more than 5 years doing PhD in US having to go back to their home countries because of this is just not a fair system. In current rule, a student can receive one 24-months extension and can get another 24-months extension if he/she pursues and completes a higher STEM degree. This makes it unfair for students who are pursuing PhD. Once they are done with their degree, they can only get one extension as there is no higher degree to pursue. This rule should allow the students who have completed PhD degree to take two 24 months extension if they have not taken any previous extension.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Govind Saraswat", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2418", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Forigners work hard to get a job.

Lost of OPT extension will cause graduate and post-graduate level education in US less attractive to international students, which in turn cause less international students seek their further education in the States, thus leading to less international tuition payment and less living expenses spent on the State's land. This could be especially detrimental to US public school, of which funding source relies very much on high international tuition payment. Then for local US students, that would mean higher college tuition and/or heavier burden on state or federal government spending on public school system. Hence, more tax should be expected by whoever is paying their tax in the States. The less living expending from the group of international students will cause a downward pressure on lodging and dining and etc industry in US, i.e. possible payment cut and downsizing in consumer and services industry. This means cancelling OPT extension has negative influence on more than just STEM skills needed or related market.\n\nThe assumption above doesn't hold. OPT extension benefits US a lot too. Those highly skilled STEM students finished their education till senior high or even college level before they receive further education in US. And during they are working under OPT/extension in US, they contribute same amount to the industry and US as those US workers do since they are producing and/or researching otherwise no company will be willing to pay them.However, US society and so US citizens benefit more from these international students, since these international students'  pre-college or even pre-graduate school was already paid by tax from their home country. If US is confident about your own education system, which means you believe your society can benefit from US students after they start working even with public education or other services spent on them being counted in. Then you should be more happy with these international students,since their early education or medical insurance in early years has been already paid not by you but their own country. And they should be as competitive as US students since they survive your education system and find a job as new comers. So you should expect they can contribute as much as US worker during their work under OPT/extension. Actually if you keep them longer in the states, US is benefiting more from already paid education from them, not to mention that those who are qualified to seek their education in US are relatively winners in their home country.\n\n24 month extension is better than 17 month extension. Many students apply for H1b sponsorship during their OPT/extension. But due to high volume for H1b, sponsorship is randomly assigned.e. Hence, longer extension and so more application opportunities for H1b reduce the chance US is losing highly skilled workers. 36 months provides company more time and opportunity to test whether the student worker is they want or not. More time means more hassle the company is going through, more investment the company is investing in the student, more lawyer fee the company is paying for the student's application for H1b and more risk the company is enduring to lose the student. I strongly believe if one company could do these for one of employee, that's absolutely not b/c s/he accept lower payment since the expense to keep the employee legal in the states is high also. But it is only because the international STEM worker is real assets for the company, the industry and so the whole US. So the third reason why I uphold the new 24 extension is b/c longer extension serves a better filter for US to keep those really talented and force US companies to think more seriously whether they should hire international STEM students. \n\nThis section is devoted to response to some statements widely used in the negative comments. I am a PhD receiving stipend as teaching or research assistant. I still pay payroll tax to Fed and state and even city government. The only exempt is the first several thousands dollars due to international treaty. The real tax exempted should only account for 20%X8%=1.6% of total income since the exempted income only accounts for 20% of my annual stipend. And for those who under OPT/extension, their exempted income in absolute USD amounts stays the same and hence the percentage should be lowered to 10% and percentage exempted in terms of total salary should be lower than 0.8%. Extension of OPT may increase the amount of skilled international students in the market which put pressure on US workers.

Educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent.\nA huge amount of international students will consider the OPT extension when they decide whether to pursue a degree in U.S or some other countries such as Canada, Japan, or Germany. \nTwo of my incredibly intelligent friends from China studying Electrical Engineering both decided to go to Japan to pursue a master degree because they were afraid the 17 months OPT extension was definitely too short for them to finish a proper project in any well-known national lab. \nThe 24 months OPT extension will attract more intelligent international students and better ensure that the U.S academic sector can remain competitive globally. \n\n2. Foreign students have regularly contributed a significant amount of money into U.S. economy through the payment of tuition, living expenses, and many other ways. \nFor instance, when students are on OPT extension, they pay more money on rents, food, transportations, going shopping (as the report indicated: $16.7 billion from 2013-2014), and therefore create more jobs in U.S. by significantly contributing to local economy.\nAlso, the tuition of an international student in any school is normally 2 to 3 times higher than the local students, which means the school can benefit a lot from foreign students and use the excessive money to improve the education environment for local students. Longer OPT extension will definitely attract more international students to put their money in U.S. universities.\n\n3. Students who are on OPT extensions are definitely NOT stealing positions from local Americans. \nIndicated by federal laws, companies have to pay more on international employees and sign on a contract indicating they could not find any suitable Americans for certain positions and they had no choice but to hire a international employee. \nSTEM positions usually have very high requirements such as being talented and highly educated. Not a lot of people could satisfy the requirements of such positions. The cancellation of OPT extension will be a disaster for those companies who have such positions. They cannot hire those who are unemployed for a replacement since the unemployed people can never fulfill the requirements of these positions, because If they could, they would be hired before the international students. \n\nTherefore, regardless the passing or cancellation of this rule, the unemployed people will remain unemployed.\n\nAdditionally, most of people probably do not know, no more than 20% of the international students who are on OPT can eventually get a working VISA from the lottery and most of them actually want to go back to their home country in the end. 24 months OPT extension will give them enough experience, help them to get a competitive job in their hometown, and eventually become a good reason for them to go home without coming back.\n\nHence, I strongly support the rule and hope to see it benefits millions of us.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Emily Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18136", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule.I believe the extension from 17 to 24 months will strengthen the power of \nUS science and technology and boost US economy in the long run.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tianjie Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5046", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This policy is needed to keep the talented foreign students working in the US companies.

Those who came to US as a STEM student, as myself did twenty years ago,are mostly the top brains in their own countries and have a believe of American values.

People simple rushed to the market because the economy got better and they believed they should find a job easily but the fact is so many people believed the same thing!    Another fact we should notice, according to my own recruiting experience, (my company is well-known of hiring new graduate from universities in the bay area), the ratio of US new grads vs. international new grads who got the offer (about 1 US:2 international) is at least doubled compared to the ratio of students who apply for it, those who lined up and submitted their resume to me in the campus recruitment (1US: 4~10international). This actually shows, the job market are in favor of our US citizens, and the fact there are still more internationals being hiring is simple because there are more young people from other countries who prefers to work in the STEM majors compared to our child.\n\nIn fact, the equal job opportunity for US citizen is not in conflict with the extension of STEM F-1 student. Instead of using restricted immigration laws to block the competition from international student, it is more important to create a non- discriminant recruiting process for everyone.  If we do limit the number of international job seekers in the market, the labour economic will be hampered because the lack of motivation of both US and non-US student. It can leads to big problem for the high-tech company human strategy, which actually will benefit our competitor in China, South-Korea and other countrys by losing our priority of recruiting the most talented people from our top universities.\n\nThus, it will be a strategical win-win for both US competitivity in the global labour job market, as well as for the growth high-tech economy rooted in our country by expanding OPT for F-1 students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Leon Hsien", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14077", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree with with proposal that OPT should be extended for 24 month for STEM students. \n\nFirst, most STEM majors has working programs which lasts for at least 2 or 3 years after graduation, and the integrity of these programs would be greatly affected if a STEM student can not work for the entire process of the programs.

I am surprised that some US-born Americans are against this rule. Many of the people who against this rule are not clear about what they are talking about. Some of the comments here are completely out of logic. I would like to argue them one by one:\n\n1). Some people claim that international employees don't pay for their taxes. WRONG!! According to the regulations from the IRS, international employees are paying the same amount of taxes as native. However, they don't benefit as much as the US citizens. For example, a lot of international employees pay social security taxes, but a lot of them leave the country after working here for a few years. And they won't be able to get refund on this portion of taxes even if they will not be benefited from SST they pay after they retire.\n\n2). Some people claim that international employees will be threat to the US citizens in job market. WRONG!! To work in the US, there are a lot of restriction for non-US citizens. It is true that in some fields such as IT and engineering, a lot of employees are foreigners. However, the reason of this is because a lot of the US citizens are not willing to study science and engineering. The IT companies are expanding so quickly these years so that they won't be able hire enough US citizens to fulfill the companies' requirement. Fresh graduate international students take these positions and make their contribution to the development of the IT and engineering industry of the US. With the restriction of OPT, it is extremely difficult for these students to enter other industry if they are not in the related major. \n\n3). some people claim that international students take salary lower than the minimum wage to compete with US citizens unequally. WRONG!! For most international students, they work with LEGAL companies and pay their taxes. Their salary are definitely higher than the minimum wage. The situation of taking salary lower than minimum wage only applies to ILLEGAL immigrants. For illegal immigrants, they don't even have a chance to apply for OPT. Please don't confound OPT with illegal working in the US.\n\nNow I would like to state why STEM program is necessary not only to the international students but also to the US and the US citizen:\n1). STEM program provide a fairly long time (29 to 36 months) for international students to apply for H1B visa, therefore saves companies' money in recruiting new people. If there is no extension on the program, employees who didn't get H1B visa will have to leave the country after 12 months employment. This will be a big loss for companies who hire and train him/her. \n2). As mentioned above, STEM program only applies to students who majored in science and engineering. The reason to have this program is help fill the vacancy in related industry in the US, since there are not enough native students majored in related fields. Thus, extending the practice time for international students in these fields will benefits all these high-yield tech companies in the US. Otherwise, where can you find such a huge number of intelligent, industrial and hard-working employees? \n3). The extension of STEM program will make studying in the US more attractive. Currently the US is still the country has the most international students in the world. Usually, international students benefits more on educational revenue since they pay more on their tuition fees.

The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation.

The following clearly point out that extension is needed, and the longer the better.\n\nIf no extension, or even no OPT at all, how crisis U.S will be facing in the near future? Now the 12 months for STEM major is too short for securing one's first job. I was a graduate with master's degree trying to find a job last year, although I was among top 10% in university, it's still hard to succeed in only one interview. No matter foreigner or domestic graduates, finding their first job is pretty time consuming because we need to fill hundred's online applications and attend dozens interviews, all these process need time. A 12 months period may only enough for 10 interviews. How many domestic graduates can get job within 10 interviews? And much less of internationals. If a skillful international graduate have to go home only because his time limitation to find job, how to say this is not a pity? They should have chance to apply their skills and knowledge to U.S companies to help them earn more, but they have to leave. In addition, what they will do when they back to home country? Get enough time to find job and benefit to their home companies, of course. As far as I know, some countries such as China and India have new policies to recall their students back to build companies. Most of the co-founder of DJI have experience of study in U.S, if they didn't go back after graduation, won't DJI be a successful U.S company? Furthermore, the shorter of OPT period, the less possibility that students will come to study in U.S, which strongly decrease multi culture in universities, and make them less competitive among other universities in the world.\n\nConsider the existence of the extension. Students, or say international graduates will have time long enough to find their jobs,thus applying their knowledge and skills to U.S company. Most of the graduates coming from China and India have better math and logic education, which is extremely welcomed by companies over U.S. If they have longer time to apply for work visa, they will absolutely focus more on their work and lean on their company. The longer stay of them can also bring more opportunities for economic, such as house renting, used car market and tourism, strongly help local government to gain income. \n\nThe argument of international graduates have negative impact for domestic gradates is not convincing. Though OPT allows some time to find jobs, it does not allow all of the internationals to stay. Only graduates with the best skills and knowledge can have a chance to success and stay. For example, if a company hire an international, in most cases it is because this person is the best, even better than domestic competitors. The best person deserve the opportunity to be hired. Actually, domestic graduates have the exact same chance to get their jobs, as all people should be treated equal during interview. \n\nAs we can see the point is not international graduates grab domestics' jobs, they are continuously contribute to the whole country's economic. They are bringing opportunities, not ruining. An extension is necessary to ensure internationals contribution.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Boao Song", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14131", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think international students play an important role in US's working force, and will become more and more important.

From my experience, they all look for jobs in the same way as any other American citizen does, they go through absolutely the same interview process and are exposed to the same benefits as American citizens - the wage difference is a myth that is being perpetuated by parties not familiar with the subject. There is no problem with \"fairness\" - every single international student goes through the same exact process as any American to get employed, but with ten times more restrictions. Whoever mentioned that it is just a matter of hiring foreign workers for cheap labor is, once again - not aware of the process to get a work authorization. Coming to the United States on an F-1 visa, pay out-of-state tuition, combined with international fees, limited amount of on and off-campus employment, restrictions for work hours - all these are the things international students are already going through that no American student does.

New immigrants, especially highly educated immigrants, bring vitality to this country. Most international students, especially in STEM programs which are very selective, are truly elites of their home countries. By extending the OPT period, they have a better chance to stay in the US and contribute to the country. A short OPT period, on the contrary, will force them to leave. \n\nSecond, extending the OPT period is important for the economy. The number of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents with graduate degrees in electrical engineering dropped by 5% for PhD programs and by 11% for masters degrees between 1995 and 2013, according to a published study by the National Foundation for American Policy. Similar trend exists in other STEM disciplines. This makes international students more needed in these areas. Silicon Valley companies, for example, are urging for more international employees and an immigration reform, according to Wall Street Journal(http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/09/18/silicon-valley-wants-high-skilled-immigration-on-campaign-agenda/). \n\nThird, these highly educated immigrants will create more jobs for the country. This might sound counterintuitive, but the reason is the STEM international group are entrepreneurial and they start startups that employ American employees. Immigrants now start more than a quarter of new businesses in this country, and immigrant-owned businesses pay an estimated $126 billion in wages per year, employing 1 in 10 Americans who work for private companies, according to the February issue of Inc. this year. \n\nLast but not least, extending the OPT period will have more potential leaders stay in our States and contribute to the society. There are many immigrant leaders in the industry. More than 20 percent of the 2014 Inc. 500 CEOs are immigrants. Sundar Pichai, coming from India and now CEO of Google, was an international student at Stanford and MIT. Shantanu Narayen, also coming from India and now CEO of Adobe Systems, was an international student at UC Berkeley. These tech leaders are invaluable treasures of our country, and by extending the OPT period we may have more of them contributing to our society in the future.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuan Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17566", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is ludicrous and borders on the insane to keep importing foreign laborers when millions of our Americans are out of work and can't even find a job.

The new rule also states that American employers would be better supervised to provide training and equal opportunities for both citizens and non-citizen employees. Notice that OPT is for students to pursue more internships and training in their degree field, which help them to better understand their scope and what they want to do related to their degree they obtained from American universities (which cause a fortune). F-1 students in the STEM field are not stealing jobs from the US job market. First of all, we along with American students go through the same selection process for academia and job hunting. 99% of the time it is already really hard for us to go into the interview room. Students in OPT already survived the fierce competitions and made their way to prove their abilities. I personally take working in the U.S. as an opportunities to apply my knowledge from my degree and to learn more about my job, which my homecountry failed to offer. I value this experience very important, I believe so do other international students who work really hard at school to learn more knowledge and create more opportunities for themselves. While at school, my peer American classmates were doing co-ops and internships for companies, and they tended to understand more about the major and class contents because they already had the experience in industry from their internship. I was jealous of their experience but I had really hard time finding internship opportunities because I would require sponsorship from companies. Once I even got kicked out from an interview room two minutes after I entered. The very first question the person from this big international company I interviewed with asked was do I need sponsorship after graduation, then the interview ended there. As long as DHS along with US government and these universities pay more attentions to sneaking companies who are disturbing the job market by alluring cheap labor for their good. The problems are with those companies, not with F-1 students from all of the world. I believe no matter where they are, the rest of the F-1 students would continue proving we are good at what we are.

The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by . .", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10094", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As an employer/manager of foreign nationals currently on a STEM extension because of pending H1-B applications, I enthusiastically support this proposal and urge for it to be made a part of our nation's policies.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Matthew Panas, Capital One", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1688", "postedDate": "2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This proposal is exciting.

From my perspective, this proposal will benefit US in several aspects both currently and in the long run.\n\nFirst, the arrival of well-educated foreign students stimulates local economy around universities. The arrival of more foreign students means larger demands on real estate developers and agencies, automobile dealers, food and drinks, recreational sites and so on. Local residents could make more money to accommodate the incoming students, which on turn leads to a more convenient and diverse life for local people. Thus the incoming of more undergraduates and graduates will immediately stimulate local economy and eventually improve the living quality of local residents.\n\nSecondary, STEM OPT students who is working in US will benefit the retirement pension system. Every penny the STEM OPT students earns, they pay federal tax and local tax for it. But eventually, quite a large part of the students will not have the US citizenship and will not earn the pension from federal government. Most OPT students are in their 20s and 30s. This means that for about 40 years, hundreds of thousands of students put lots of their money in US with low interests. This will reduce the burden of the retirement pension system, and is helpful for the US economy recovery and development. \n\nSome people argue that US citizens lose jobs because OPT students will accept job offers with lower wages. This is ridiculous. If OPT students wants to stay, they have to apply for h1b lottery selection. One of the h1b requirement is \"must be paid at least the actual or prevailing wage for your occupation, whichever is higher\" (http://www.uscis.gov/eir/visa-guide/h-1b-specialty-occupation/understanding-h-1b-requirements). If they have jobs whose wage is obviously below average, the OPT students will lose the opportunity to apply for h1b and couldn't keep their jobs. Thus, the OPT students will not threaten the US citizens in the job market.\n\nBesides, the foreign students travels a lot between US and their own country, various airlines and other public transportation companies will benefit from this. Also, the foreign students need to buy all kinds of gifts for their family members and friends, which will also encourage the economic development.\n\nBased on the above aspects, I think the existence of foreign students is good for the local economy and US federal government, not only for STEM OPT students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Marie Lu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17088", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Strongly Approved.

I.E Disney World.\n\nThe proposals are presented as humanitarian, yet buckles to corporate interests over the needs of seniors who paid into a system all of their lives.

Some apply for citizenship or just blend in without paying into the system. However, they use our social services and medical systems that they never paid for. Great deal for them.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, in a letter to President Obama, stated:\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThe proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it. The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\n\nOPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers. Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? \n\nThere is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates. U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000. DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly. If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\n\nNot only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. A 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\n\nThe worker protections included in the new rule \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.They do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, they chase Americans out of computer science and they create a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\nTo summarize, this proposed rule is so ill-advised that it needs to be totally scrapped. We need programs for putting Americans to work, not programs like this that give American jobs to cheap foreign labor.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fred Stevens", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3829", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be validthere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" I agree with the above comment made by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley.\n\nAnd would add that is policy is discriminating against current STEM students who could use the experience in industry to get a start on their careers.

On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.\n\nSome argue that those international students create intense competition for jobs in the U.S. In fact, this is a good thing in a long run. The competion can push the majority of our citizens to enhance and increase their skills and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. As we know, citizens already have a natural edge when competing with foreigners because they do not need sponsorship and they have language advantage. We should probably blame our elementary education in STEM instead of immigrants if our citizens still find it hard to land a job in STEM field with all these advantages! If we let the tremendous amount of skill-equipped human resources outflow from the U.S only because of weak competitive power of our citizens., then it will be an unestimated loss to our domestic companies and to the country as a whole. If our domestic companies are no longer able to compete with foreign companies hiring more talented workers who once studied in our country and eventually lose global market share, then our domestic industries will be severely impacted and unemployment rate of citizens will go even higher.  \n\nSo, if those people really need something to worry about, this is what they are supposed to worry about: why not spending more time improving their own skills set those companies are looking for instead of wasting time leaving negative comments here?

They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. A great example should be the new Google's CEO Sundar Pichai who leaded the team to develop Google Chrome which not only helped Google earns huge amount of profit but also drove a tremendous increase in US tech industry. As we all know, Sundar was one of the F-1 nonimmigrant students about twenty years ago. The F-1 nonimmigrant students cases also applied to Satya Nadella who is the current CEO of microsoft. \n\nAlso, improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.\n\nIn conclusion, this suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly.

Most of them get offers from big companies such as IBM, or big four accounting company. They also get to choose the location they prefer. On the other hand, International student are facing a lot of barriers because a lot of companies do not provide sponsorship. To find a job, they usually spend longer time, and get jobs maybe hundreds mils away. In terms of competition, it was not fair, from the beginning. A lot of companies already do prefer citizen that international students. \n\nSome of the opponents say that this policy would make companies in favor of hiring foreigners than US citizen, because they ask for lower wage.

The proposal is both helpful to the international student and US. For the international student, only a relative long-time OPT is helpful, because few employer is likely to hire a person who can only work within 12 months. Also a longer OPT is more helpful to the international students to get more working experience. For the US, the STEM students are what the US really need. All of the STEM student devote themselves on IT, Engineering, Science and Math. Many US companies on these industries are lack of such kind of employee. Also the STEM students are the most important one to help the US leading the world on the STEM industries.\n\n2. Assume that the proposal failed and there is no longer any OPT extension for the STEM international students, the international STEM applicants for the US universities will consider about going to other countries for the education such as Canada, Australia or somewhere else, because they provide a more friendly working authorization for the international student. And this is no doubt harmful to US economy.\n\n3. The STEM international students are not harmful to the most of US residents on seeking a job. Some people may have the idea that the STEM international students will get the jobs which belonged to the US residents. But the truth is that US is lacking of the STEM kinds of employee. IT and Engineering companies seek for and hire a large amount of STEM students every year, because there is not enough US residents applicants on these industries. In the other words,  most STEM students are working on the fields where only US residents applicants and employees are not enough for the industries instead of some competitive fields which is even unable offer enough for the US residents.\n\nAll in all, I strongly support on the proposal because it is helpful to the US economy and not harmful to the US people.

Those students have learned the best technologies and skills in top universities. It would be conducive to American economy if the government could have them in States to assist America with technological innovations. Every single students worked in STEM field could create even more job positions and opportunities in the long-run. There is no need to be short-sighted.\n\nSecondly, STEM students will not necessarily squeeze out job opportunities. STEM field usually requires students with adequate knowledge and techniques in this field. Therefore, the competition mainly occurred among students in that specific filed and simultaneously, international students are surly less competitive with native Americans on the same level. Even if the company truly hired some outstanding and talent students, isn't it a fortunate for America to have another Albert Einstein? Is sending Einstein away for the purpose of employment rate really advisable?\n\nThirdly, the longer of OPT, the lesser a student will require for the salary. Usually, very competitive international students will get a job within a month or two after graduation while less competitive students urges for more time. Therefore, they will decrease their requirements for salary with time goes by. As a result, these students will finally choose to go to some small companies or some positions are unwilling to be taken by native Americans. But there capabilities can be strong and well-rounded. Still, in the long-term, economy will benefits from the development of these companies.\n\nIn sum, isn't it a good thing to make the best use of the high quality population from other countries? American is such an inclusive country which makes Uncle Sam strongest around the world. Do the protesters really feel the pressure from international students or employees or simply remain hidebound to conservative concepts? I anxiously appeal to all the protesters to have a thorough understanding of the original intention of this proposal.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by XIANGJI CHEN", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21781", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a technical recruiter at Facebook and I think we should allow a 24 months extension for STEM students.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\n    The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\n    The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\n    I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.

In particular, I strongly agree with the following provisions of the proposed rule:\n\n1.\tIncreasing the total period of the OPT STEM extension to 24 months. Students on a STEM extension are usually hired in specialty occupations. Training a new employee and entrusting them with responsibilities takes a substantial amount of time. If students are to contribute and gain real experience, a longer time period is necessary, and 24 months is appropriate to make a substantial impact, and kickstart a student's career.\n2.\tThe safeguards for US workers, and prevailing wage requirements alleviate concerns of STEM OPT students taking over jobs that would otherwise be obtained by US workers.\n3.\tThe mentoring and training plan requirements ensures that students will actually be employed by an employer that can provide the required guidance, training, and mentoring that they need during their early career phase.\n4.\tThe additional STEM extension is welcome news for students who are interested in working for a few years to gain practical experience before going back to school. The single OPT STEM extension per lifetime rule was overly restrictive, especially since many students go back to earn a higher degree level, and continue to contribute to the industry.\n5.\tSchool accreditation and site visits are crucial to ensure that students don't simply enroll in unaccredited schools with lax enrollment guidelines for the sole objective of obtaining work authorization.\n6.\tIncreasing the allowed period of unemployment to 150 days is a welcome relief, since the job search process is extremely stressful, unpredictable, and time consuming.\n\nThis rule provides substantial economic, academic, and cultural benefits to the United States, as specified in section IV. C. of the proposed rule. As stated in section IV. C. 2, it is important for the US to continue retaining high skilled foreign graduates ahead of other countries that may prove to be more viable destinations if the legal immigration system in the US proves to be too restrictive, cumbersome, or otherwise unfriendly to high skilled foreign graduates.\n\nWhile the rule makes some good proposals, we would also appreciate clarity on the following topics of contention:\n1.\tThe effects of a final rule not being in place by Feb. 13, 2016 on students who already have approved STEM extensions.\n2.\tWhether a higher degree in a non STEM field is grounds for a second 24 months STEM extension.\nFinally, I also suggest that students who have been on the OPT extension for a period of time be considered dual intent, and file for a green card without it having negative repercussions on future F1 visa applications.\n\nSincerely,\nAnurag Bhatt\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anurag Bhatt", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1913", "postedDate": "2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this proposal since US made enough money out of these F1 students ( See how much tuition these guys paid), and now you should give them enough time to train their skills here before they left here.

Finally, I chose America as my graduate school country, not only because its high quality of education, but also because America can provide us a long time to work in this country. Many university's advertisement emphasizes this advantage over other countries. Now I hope this work situation can be kept and become better with this 24 months extension. As you know, Canada can provide graduate students with green card. So if America cannot approve this 24-month extension, America will surely lose its advantage of attract more international students to study in America. They will choose Canada or Australia instead.\n\nSecondly, as is known to all, the most people who work in fields are foreigners. If the government cannot approve this 24-month extension, there will certainly be a lot of excellent workers to leave America to go to their home country because of the VISA issue, which will definitely bring a lot of horrible impacts on America's economy. This situation, I think, no one want to see in the future.\n\nLastly, a number of commenters, however, objected to the 24-month STEM OPT extension on the basis of potential negative impacts on U.S. workers in STEM fields. For instance, a commenter stated that demand for technical workers was very weak in engineering occupations and growing modestly in computing and mathematics occupations. The same commenter stated that, especially when combined with H-1B, L-1, and other skilled workers, the number of students taking advantage of the STEM OPT extension would distort the domestic labor market. Some commenters specifically stated that employers would prefer to hire F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions because these students would work for lower wages. Some commenters noted that some U.S. firms had previously advertised STEM positions as being available only to OPT students. Commenters requested that DHS consider written reports, testimony, and other sources describing the state of the U.S. STEM workforce. Commenters also questioned the veracity of studies and reports cited in the preamble to the 2008 IFR, and some questioned whether DHS had interpreted that information correctly in assessing the then-prevailing STEM labor market. Some commenters stated that the STEM OPT extension was contrary to the academic purpose of the F-1 statute. In general, commenters who made these and similar points requested that DHS eliminate the STEM OPT extension and the Cap Gap provision in their entirety.\n\nThat's why I support this 24-extension without any hesitation.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhihao Ji, Carnegie Mellon University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12332", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I believe the expansion of the F-1 non-immigrant students with stem degrees is a very bad idea for a large number of Americans.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT.

I got my masters degree in Engineering from a large public university. I learnt a great deal during my schooling in the US and had the good fortune to be taught by world renowned scientists. \n\nI remember towards the end of my degree, I along with few other grad students and post-docs were attending a meeting to review recent research results from a visiting professors lab. We had unending questions about the results and were politely but relentlessly questioning the visiting professor. My professor proudly pointed to us and said to the visiting professor \"look at how critical these young researchers are of the material you presented, they don't accept the material at face value and have learned to think like scientists\". I realized at that moment that slowly, without even realizing it, under the careful, critical and tireless tutelage of my professors, my mind had finally opened and begun to process information like a scientists' should. \n\nAfter graduating, I applied for the OPT visa and started working at a company that manufactures very complex scientific equipment. My master's thesis was based on this equipment and this role provided me the opportunity to understand more about the physics, applications and inner workings of this technology. \n\nI know for a fact that I had not displaced any US citizens by taking up my current job and this position was open for months before I applied and was hired. \n\nMy educational background, engineering skills and aptitude have proven to be very valuable for the company I work for and I have been a highly contributing employee thus far.  I have had very supportive and experienced mentors who have continuously trained and guided me. I have learnt more working alongside my fellow engineers than I could have learnt in a university setting. \n\nMoreover many of the soft skills that I picked up at my job are the foundation of having a successful lifelong career in engineering. I learned to apply my skills in an environment where teamwork, dealing with customers, collaborators and outside competition was just as important as getting the right answers. \n\nHaving the 12 months OPT and 24 months STEM extension in my opinion is absolutely crucial for engineering roles where technologies evolve so quickly that what is learned in universities is outdated by the time we graduate. \n\nInternships do help in getting some practical experience but to become an effective engineer we need to be involved in developing enterprise scale projects which take years of continuous effort. Internships generally provide opportunities to work on small projects that can be completed in 3-6 months.\n\nUnfortunately my 17 month OPT period ends in mid-December and it seems unlikely that the 24 month STEM extension rule would be finalized before then. \n\nI urge you to please consider allowing students who have recently completed their 17 month STEM extension and are currently in their 60 day grace period to apply for the balance 7 months extension. \n\nThough I have learnt a great deal about one instrument, my training is still incomplete and I have not even begun to get trained on the highly complex equipment we supply to synchrotron labs around the world. This rule would provide students like me an invaluable opportunity to complete projects we started working on years ago. Though I have learnt a great deal about one instrument, my training is still incomplete and I have not even begun to work on the highly complex equipment we supply to synchrotron labs around the world. \n\nIf I had to suddenly leave, my company would have to scramble to hire someone in my place. The projects I am working on could be delayed for months before someone with suitable skills and experience can be found and brought up to speed.

As a college student, every time I go to listen to career talks by career advisers and employers, the importance of internship experience is always greatly emphasized, because it helps to provide an outlook to the work that students will encounter in their future endeavors, to get students started in developing skills at an early point in their career, and to guide students in planning their studies.\n\nHowever, short term internship does not give the complete picture of the industry that a student would like to engaed in. This is why many STEM companies offer \"rotation programs\" that let college graduate to be involved in different area of their business in a hands-on fashion. These programs often last for at least 2 years to ensure that graduates have a comprehensive view of the industry, which will allow these graduates to become industry leaders quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, for students who has a strong career focus, such as graduate students, projects can be quite long. In my studies for master in mechanical engineering, most STEM research grants that I have seen involve 2 to 3 years of time (through several phases) to arrive at a sound conclusion. This is true for industries research projects as well. Many Engineering research and development managers that I have spoken to expressed that it is common for these projects to takes 5 years to be abble to apply to products for customers.\n\nFrom these personal experience, I am very convinced that the proposed STEM OPT Extension, with its improved procedural oversight and renewed emphasis on mentoring/training in hands-on environment, is a necessary part of students education that allow sufficiently long practical experience.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Guanyang Luo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14268", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The United States is leading the world due to its advantage in technology and finance, both of which need a lot of employees with STEM degree.

If this rule doesn't make it through, the US Universities will be less attractive to foreign students and it will result in decline in tuition revenues and income that could have been generated by the tax paid by international students, resulting in the US economy going in the footsteps of UK's economy.Apart from this, the pool of people thinking to resolve a problem will be less diverse, thus granting a chance to other competitive countries, who are more open to welcoming students in their land to study and gain experience.The students who go back would compete and create a more competitive company, which might lead to closure of many firms in the US, thus depleting further job opportunities for US citizens.If these students were allowed to stay in US they would in turn create those companies here in the US and expand job opportunities for Americans.\n4. Students will be able to work under the mentor ship of experienced US professionals on more challenging projects if the 36 months extension gets approved as opposed to the earlier 17 month rule.It will be more meaningful learning experience for me to setup a professional road map at the start of my OPT with my employer's input to put my classroom skills into practice.\n5.Cap Gap relief is important and it must be implemented to avoid inconvenience to the USCIS and the international students, as they wouldn't have to go through the stamping procedure.\n6.DHS should take steps to prevent hardships to existing students and should urge the court to allow student already in the US (before Vacatur of 2008 rule) to be allowed for continuing on the 17th month extension in case this rule is not passed.The international students on current OPT programs pay their taxes and this courtesy must be extended by the United States to those international students.\n7.The DHS  should increase the Cap of 20,000 for US advanced degree holders in H1B visa selection to 40,000 per year.This might be added to the proposed rule to make it better for the employers and the international students.\n      Many opponents of this rule state that jobs would be lost to International students and would be taken from US citizens.I believe that this is not true, as the person best qualified to do the job would be selected if the US wishes to maintain its status as the superpower of this world.If the US goes into protectionist mode and asks these students to go back, it will have detrimental effect on the US economy as these smart people would go back and make their own countries more competitive with the US education.If the international students were turned back by not passing this rule, the positions with the US companies would be vacant for long time, hitting their performance and many small firms would perish for want of qualified people.If US is a land of immigrants, then why are people against those who desire nothing but are in the pursuit of knowledge and experience,while selflessly serving the American society and industry.The United States must welcome hardworking international students and let them benefit by gaining on the job experience as they benefit the United States economy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Arjun Singh", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14447", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As the trend of the previous years shows, skilled students have made huge contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research.

Benefits to the U.S. economy.\n\nU.S. has been the #1 country in the world for years, and one of the main reasons of this success is because of its diversity.\n\nEver since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, technology innovation has become a key factor of determining a countrys place in the world, and U.S. sure grabbed this gist. This country draws talented people in by its world-class working and living environment, and pay them back with its welcoming and open mind. It brings people from different parts of the world and cultures together to do great things. There are immigrants contributing to almost every industry: IT, space exploration, military, movie, medical field, etc., and a lot of them are on the top of their respective fields. To draw more talented people in and make this country stay competitive, extending OPT extension period for STEM students sure is a good way to provide more opportunities for international students to find a job and transit to H1-B visa in order to use the knowledge they learned from U.S. universities and contribute back to this country.\n\nAccording to a 2012 report from the Information Technology Industry Council(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/stem-report.pdf), the Partnership for a New American Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, research has found that every foreign-born student who graduates from a U.S. university with an advanced degree and stays to work in STEM has been shown to create on average 2.62 jobs for American workersoften because they help lead in innovation, research, and development., and this report only shows the value and job opportunities STEM students had been creating until 2012. In fact, according to another report(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf), immigrants were founders of 18 percent of all Fortune 500 companies, many of which are high-tech giants. As of 2010, these companies generated $1.7 trillion in annual revenue, employed 3.6 million workers worldwide, and included well known companies like AT&T, Verizon, Google, United States Steel, Nordstrom, and so on. The value that STEM students have been and will be bringing to the U.S. economy and workforce is tremendous.\n\n(Reference: http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/always-demand-economic-contributions-immigrant-scientists-and-engineers)\n\n\n2. Benefits to the daily lives of American citizens.\n\nFirst and most important of all, STEM students create more job opportunities. More and more native-born workers get jobs and the ability to live a better life, which leads to a more health and stable society. As the growth of STEM related industries, other non-STEM industries will also experience a business booming caused by this growth. For example, the Yelp mobile app created a more direct way for information exchanging between businesses and customers and has been benefiting billions of businesses. In todays technology world, the influence of STEM industries are unignorable.\n\nIn a smaller picture, the influence of the growth of STEM related industries to our lives is obvious. They make our daily activities easier and do the things that could only be seen in Sci-Fi movies 50 years ago. Google Map, Tesla electric car, Yelp, Uber, those innovations have become so close to our lives that we cannot even imagine how people in the 80th live without these technologies. It has been a true life-changing experience thanks to the booming of STEM industries.\n\nLast but not least, STEM students make America a truly multicultural society. In this very land of freedom, people has a chance to be friends with people from other part of the world, try different food, learn different cultures. It is not only what makes this country attractive for talented people from all over the world, but also how it becomes the #1 country in the world, and STEM students are a very important part of it.\n\n\n\n3. Benefits to STEM students.\n\nSTEM students are eager to find a job in the U.S. after graduating from school. U.S. is the headquarter of innovations. Gaining industry-leading work experience could benefit their career and enhance businesses between U.S. and their home country. But as more and more STEM students coming in every year, the chance of winning the H1-B lottery becomes less and less. This leaves a lot of talented people no choice but go home. Extending OPT-Extension period could give them more chances to win the lottery and keep serving this country. For those highly competitive majors, this proposal could give those good-standing candidates more time to find a job so that their talent could have enough time to be discovered, and the companies could choose from best of the best.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this proposal is a win-win for both U.S. government and STEM students.

I understand opponents concerns and opinions, but I would like to give the following responses:\n\n1). One of opinions from opponents will be that more and more foreign students will grab employment chances from citizens. Instead, foreign students can create more opportunities for everyone. Many of them stay and work to either develop their current companies or start their own business. Both result in expansion of career market. For instance, the publishing company my wife is working at was founded by Chinese and they hire both Chinese and Americans, as they need people who can speak Chinese for editing and they also need native English speakers to be in contact with administrators, teachers and take charge of marketing and sales. Another thing to note is that, this opposing point doesnt make much sense as the essential reason why its hard to have the opportunity is job hunters ourselves rather than the fact that we have so many competitors. \n2). Another comment from opponents may be that fewer and fewer Americans will study STEM due to more and more foreign students take the positions in high tech companies. Lets take the major of computer science as an example. Then, heres my question looking back to years ago when there were no many foreign students, were there lots of people studying computer science at that time?  Apparently  no, simply for high-tech industry was not developed yet. Then, thanks to innovation by pioneers and efforts by more and more followers (including the great number of foreign students in recent years), high tech industry starts to thrive and high tech study comes to be the trend that more and more people (no matter theyre foreign or local) have started to devote themselves to study of computer science. We cant simply compare the numbers between foreign students and American students in the job market, rather, a more convincing way should be comparing numbers between now and then. \n3). Another point from opposing side is that foreign students are not deprived of working right and they can still work for at least 1 year after graduation. If their companies like, they can get sponsored for work permit of a longer term. Yes, this is true. However, in this case, most of foreign students with high tech skills will then have to go back to their home countries either for their companies cant offer sponsorship or, more importantly, they dont win the lottery for H1B. Therefore, to a certain extent, the new extension policy resolve the problem caused by the limited H1B quota per year. The policy will also make companies more willing to hire foreign students as at least they wont be forced to just stay for one year and leave. Therefore, the new extension policy will create fair employment environment and will also help companies choose the best among more candidates (no matter theyre foreign or local).\n4). The opponents would also believe that even many foreign students need to leave after one years work and it should be enough for companies. Companies can then hire new people. This might be true for some positions, however, for many positions, they require stability, dedication and team chemistry. This is especially true for STEM jobs, simply for one project will probably run throughout years with collaboration of different departments. Frequent personnel change will lead to much extra spending on time and cost for looking for new people, training them to well fit in and even facing their mistakes before they gain enough experience, while these spending could have been applied to more investment in project itself like upgrading systems, building up partnership and etc. Even for my wifes non-STEM position in a sales department, it needs more than one years stay of the same person to keep the relationship with the customers, let along a more complicated project. \n\nBased on my opinions above, I do hope the new policy can be passed soon.

Nowadays it is extremely challenging to find qualified software engineers without considering international candidates. So far this year, my company's recruitment costs alone consumed about 30% of our seed fund. In the current market, companies need to pay a lot to recruit high quality programming talents to fill open positions in under six months. There are simply not enough qualified candidates in the existing job market. I don't see the point of further shrinking the candidate pool when it is already small if this proposal does not pass. There are about 7 people in our 30-person tech team who are on OPT/H1B and to be honest it would be a devastation to my company if I have to let all 7 of them go in February 2016. \n\nI read some of the comments here and frankly I don't understand why people keep mentioning the Disney example and saying that this program will take jobs from American citizens. The technology industry is very different than the old D's. Generally speaking, technology companies hire engineers and scientists, and through the products that they make, more jobs will be created. Hiring any engineer would help the U.S. economy. Take my company's business model as example, by successfully hiring a software engineer, regardless of whether or not they are a U.S. citizen, we can add more new features to our product. With new features and innovative products we can hire more salespeople, marketing people and tech support engineers to market and provide support to our customers. I cannot fathom why others are commenting that these engineers are taking American citizens' jobs. As far as I can see, they are creating more jobs for Americans. It is a simple win-win policy. \n\nI believe strengthening this STEM OPT extension program would create a constant stream of jobs in America. As long as STEM students are working in the innovation industries, they are bringing jobs in associated industries. The pros to our economy of maintain the STEM OPT extension program outweigh the cons. If this program is indeed terminated in February, it will not only strike my job-creating, tax-paying and economy-contributing company but many others as well.

On the contrary, they are weaker than US citizens in most degrees of arts. So is it wrong for international students to achieve their careers that they are skilled in?\n2. America is such a developed country that needs lots of talents doing various works. Believe me, most IT companies would become a standstill or even broken if this proposal didn't pass. The reason is so simple, most engineers especially software engineers are from China or India. If the legal identification was taken away from them, their contributions to companies wouldn't continue any more. It's serious to consider the prospect of these engineering companies.\n3. America is always an open country from the very beginning in its history. This country was founded by Native Americans who were not originally from America. America needs international talents to enhance the economic. Just like Americans can't live without things made in China, America's development can't move fast without international students' contributions.\n\nI truly hope my opinions could be considered.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cynthia Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16443", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "F-1 non immigrant students come here to better their academic value by pursuing higher degrees in their interested  STEM field of study very rigorously.

First, the STEM F1 students are only a small group of the whole graduating students. Even though they might be very competitive in some certain areas, they can't grab all available positions in the job market all the time. And in other broader stages, these international students are not competitive at all. Second, there are many types of companies in the America, big ones, medium ones, small ones and numerous start-up companies, which determines the job openings here will never be fully filled up. In addition, US citizens have unmatched networking in the America. They have friends, family and relatives who are able to refer them to internal job positions. This advantage is a crucial factor in a successful job searching. \n\nBesides, F1 visa has lots of restrictions and limited legal status, about which most US citizens do know nothing. In fact, the process for an international student to get a job is much more complicated than US citizens. Companies might not want to train international students since F1 visa only supports them to work legally for 12 month plus extension time as practical training, unless the student get approved to receive a H1 visa. In terms of the H1 visa, many companies don't sponsor at all because they don't want to spend time and money on filing a case for the international students. Nowadays, companies compare candidates for their positions. If a specific position cannot be fit by a suitable US citizen at a certain time, they will turn to consider \ninternational candidates. The only thing that would jeopardize the citizen's right in job hunting is some consulting companies that trade foreign students or workers directly from other country or within the US at a lower salary rate. These companies fight for H1 visa positions to make those low-salary workers be eligible to work in America. With an unbelievable competitive low rate, these workers will definitely influence the job market. \n\nThere are also some citizens worrying about other issues that F1 students might cause, which I think, will also not be a problem. Most of these STEM F1 students are pursuing doctorate's, master's students and bachelor's degree. With a higher degree, people are much more educated and civilized, which is why the US is the the greatest country in the world and the citizens are always kind and friendly. Well-behaved people are tend to make good influence on each other, so I think the majority of STEM F1 students are good people. Besides, these F1 students are the minority in the states and they have less rights than the citizen. Even if there's something bad happening, the majority will definitely stand out and take over of it. The strongest country in the world will also not allow such things happen. If this will be a problem, we can also suggest schools make careful decisions before extending an offer to a student and limit the number of admitted students.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Nilab Wams", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20830", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please extend OPT for 24 months atleast which helps in building our career.

As follows I will state how the United State will benefit from this policy, taking the example of myself, a PhD in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\n \nFirst, a long term OPT could give us the opportunity to make major contributions in the area we expert to.\n \nTake me as an example. My research area is distributed system and cloud computing in computer engineering. A typical project I work on should take more than 2 years (usually 3 year if we are to build a comprehensive system), since a project included demand analysis, protocol design, lots of experiments, diagnoses and revisions, and each of them takes months, or years to accomplish. Not to mention those who work in Chemistry or Biology, the projects may last even longer.\n \nWith a short term OPT, almost no one would choose to start such a long-term work with the risk of leaving the project before thoroughly accomplishing it, even though the work was solid. Instead, one may choose a short-term project, which is safer, but imagine how much reduction in his contribution to this area, to America.\n \nAnother thing that I want to mention is the positive effect that a long-term OPT could bring to the governments budget. In my school, or at least in my department, more than half students are Chinese of Indian, i.e. international student. Each of us pays for lounging, food, transportations, and the most important thing: tuitions. For all those we spend, tax is paid to the government. \n \nObviously, a long-term OPT will definitely encourage more international student to attend US universities. Thus it leads to a makeable increasing in governments budget. Plus, we all know that the tuition for an international student exceeds that of a local student by more than a little.

It will bring more international student to U.S.. As I know, the tuition and stipend in U.S. is higher than other countries, like Canada, U.K., Australia. One of the reason why the education in U.S. is so attractive despite the higher cost is that we have the OPT and OPT extension program. These international talents can not only gain knowledge in school but also have the opportunity to gain work experience. Based on the survey(http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/Economic-Impact-of-International-Students), in 2013/14 international students contributes 27,000,000,000 dollars to U.S. economy. If this rule is declined, it will decrease the number of international students sharply and definitely harm the economy.\n\n2. Based on my own experience as hiring manager, I prefer hiring a citizen rather than an international student. Because hiring an international student will cost more money than hiring a citizen. Company need to file work visa for them and at the same time take the risk to lost the candidates if they are not selected in the H1 work visa lottery. So I don't think this rule will put the non-citizens in front of citizens.\n\n3. Someone claim that this rule will allow non-citizens \"steal\" their job opportunities since they are much cheaper than citizens. I fully oppose their opinion. One reason is mentioned in sentence 2. Besides that, the non-citizens who \"steal\" their jobs due to low wage are those from offshore consulting firms. These guys don't have a degree from educational institutions in U.S. and they only need a much cheaper salary to be hired. We should propose law to forbid them to steal work opportunity from citizens.  \n\n4. Besides, strong restrictions must be made to make sure that these international students don't harm the right of citizens. For instance, wage minimum requirement, company blacklist of who cheat in hiring international students.

The new STEM rule would allow students bring newest knowledge from school to industry practice during their internship/employment based on it. During the past several years, many US industries, especially the High Tech and Financial, have benefited from the old 17-month rule.

Below are some of my thoughts about it.\n\nI heard that WATW began to use a facebook page to instigate their members and other people to leave negative comments to this rule and they even provided some sample comments and templates to make things easier for everyone. How sweet is that! For those who object to this proposal, they argue that international students (i.e non-resident aliens) have taken away too many STEM job opportunities from hard-working Americans by taking advantage of STEM OPT and its extension. It is not acceptable because American kids who are born and raised under the US education system should be smart and creative enough to qualify for those jobs, which are usually of good pay also. Citizens should have the priority to get better jobs so the STEM OPT itself was not supposed to exist at the first place, let along extending it for non-resident aliens.\n\n\nAs an international student myself, I admit that United States have a great education system, particularly higher education, and that is why my husband and I chose to get our post-graduate degree here after we graduated from college. And I believe so are the many, many other international students around the world. I also appreciate the fact that our American classmates and colleagues in graduate school are brilliant, diligent and creative thinking. However as a student with STEM major, I also believe that the American people who object to this rule have probably ignored a key fact, which is the proportion of international students in STEM majors in US colleges and graduate schools. My husband was from an engineering school, and at least 80% of master and doctorate students in his department are from China and India with student visa. I major in Biology and the situation is a lot better in my department. However the number of international students that my department recruits each year has kept increasing for the past five years. Our friends who studies at other major universities in US would also tell you the same thing. Why is this phenomenon commonly seen? Because there are NOT ENOUGH American students who are willing to take STEM majors in college and/or graduate school, so that universities have to turn to international students to ensure their annual recruitment. Therefore, after competing with students ALL OVER THE WORLD, we are here in the United States pursuing our STEM degrees. For me, I do not consider myself as a super intelligent person, but with an offer of tuition waiver and teaching/research assistantship in a top US graduate school, I think I'm probably not bad. \n\nThere is no need to emphasize how important STEM fields are to the US industry nowadays. Over the past years in this century the fastest developing industries are all relevant to STEM fields, including IT, bio-medical, manufacturing, etc. Considering the relatively small number of American students in these majors, companies also have to rely heavily on international graduates to work for them. I have a lot of friends who already work in some of the greatest companies in the US, like Google, Facebook, Bloomberg, Yahoo, Intel, Johnson & Johnson. Almost each and every one of them tells us that their departments are full of international graduates just like them. I believe that they got their jobs because they are just as brilliant, diligent and creative as Americans, because if you look at how much those companies have been contributing to the development of technology and economy in the US, you will know that. Now don't you think that it is our International students who are actually playing an vital role in making sure that America keeps running in the forefront of science and technology! Just imagine how much America will lose if the STEM OPT ever exists at all. \n\nI totally understand that US citizen should have the priority in terms of job opportunities just because you are the citizen of this country. However, if you guys do not take advantage of it while on the contrary blaming international students for taking away your jobs, that's probably a little bit unfair.\n\nIn summary, I strongly support this proposal.\nI strongly support this proposal.\nI strongly support this proposal.\n(It is important so I say it three times.)\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wendy Dong", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22481", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think it's a win-win proposal for both intelligent international students and the great companies in USA.

Actually, the high-tech industry has been playing an important role not only in the US economy but also in the whole global economy (see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/issuebrf/sib98319.htm). But at the same time, US is also facing the problem of high-tech worker shortage (see http://www.builtinla.com/2014/12/09/depth-report-high-tech-worker-shortage-how-obamas-executive-order-immigration-changes-it). This fact can be partly reflected by the increasing gap between the H1B visa cap and the number of applications. This causes the situation that a significant number of well-qualified workers have to give up their jobs and their companies have to look for other workers to fill in the positions, which is not easy due to the aforementioned high-tech worker shortage.\n\nSecond, some people who are against the OPT extension said some companies can take advantage of this rule to hire workers with wages lower than normal. But they have missed the important fact that a large portion of the workers who were formerly international students have already paid a large amount of money for their tuition fees. They definitely would like to earn these previous investments back. It does not make sense to me that they would be happy to get paid lower than normal. Additionally, when hiring workers, a company does not only consider how much it can save by hiring workers with lower wages, but also (actually it values more on) how many contributions these works can give to the company. It is untenable for a company to hire someone just because it can pay less money to him/her.\n\nThird, some people who are against the rule also claimed that they do not feel the citizenship of being an American because their jobs are being grabbed by foreigners. As we all know, America is a country of immigrants. Everybody who came to US is given the rights to purse his/her American dream. This holds true not only for the previous immigrants, but also for the current immigrants. These new immigrants are bringing exuberance and intelligence to the country. The previous immigrants who are having a hard time finding a job should reflect more on themselves rather than accuse the competition with the current immigrants.

It is unjust and against the interest of American citizens to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation. There are several reasons for that.\n\nInternational students made an significant contribution to the U.S. economy and cultural prosperity. International students can add diversity to a college or university, enriching the experience of other students on campus. Schools with a strong global presence often have a wealth of cultural groups and events, allowing international students an opportunity to share their food, music and traditions with their U.S. peers. Several well-known universities have large amount of international students. For example, University of CaliforniaSan Diego has 20% and Florida Institute of Technology has 33% of international students. International students also paid considerably higher tuition fees than that of U.S. residents, which improve the financial situation in many universities. Most international students' families are in middle or higher classes, which allowed them to have decent standard of lives in the U.S., and therefore improve the GDP and U.S. economies. The extension of OPT will definitely attract more international students coming and work here and therefore improve the economy, possibly increasing the job availability in different areas and reduce the unemployment rate.\n\nFurthermore, talented international students in Engineering or other science majors are VALUABLE resources. In my universities, there are numerous Chinese and Indian students in Engineering majors. In some courses, the top 10% of the students who got highest grades consisted of half of the international students! Many of my international friends also actively involved in conducting researches with eminent professors. They do love their majors and work productively to contribute the research projects in the Universities. I have seen many hardworking and talented international students who did well in both studying in colleges and working for jobs. They are regard highly by their American bosses. It is pity that they have to leave America just because their OPT expired and is also a huge loss for the industry.\n\nMoreover, some may assert that international students \"steal\" their jobs. However, isn't it American spirit to give everyone equal chance? People who worried about the job deficiencies might be either not skillful in their majors or not confident about themselves. If they are not skillful, the leaving of the talented international students could let them have the positions, but the quality of the work done by them could be much lower and the efficiency of the work would be lower. It is not a healthy trend to let someone who is not skillful enough to take the jobs by getting rid of the international students; If they are just not confident, it is an opportunity to face the competition and prove that they are talented enough. An outstanding person could think as a Global citizen but not only as an U.S. citizen. The extension of the OPT could even stimulated American citizens to improve themselves and to better compete with international students.\n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the U.S. to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. American people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary satisfactions. International students are contributing to the grow of the country.

Because of higher and higher demand on H-1B visas, the chance of getting H-1B in the 12-month OPT period is decreasing each year. Without the STEM extension rule, it's clear that if you not lucky enough to win the H-1B visa lottery in the 12-month OPT period, you have no choice but to leave the country. I am not lucky enough to win the lottery this year. For me, the proposed new rule will give back to me the opportunity to continue my career in the United States, after the federal court ruling vacated the 2008 rule earlier this year.\n\nOne common objection to the rule states that foreign students will take away more jobs from US citizens under the new rule. I find this argument shortsighted and overlooks some aspects. First of all, as my personally experience, companies will definitely favor US citizens over international students provided two candidates have the same level of skills. Many companies are not sponsoring H-1B visa for their employees, thus not likely to hire international students. And most OPT STEM field graduates are working in positions where a competent US citizen alternative is not available. Second, high skilled immigrants bring energy and entrepreneurship to US economy and created many jobs in the US. Many successfully business leaders, company founders and scientists today are initially international students who came to the US to seek their dreams. Many of them might have also used OPT program in their early careers. If those individuals were sent back home because they are not lucky enough to get H-1B visas, fewer jobs might have been created today.\n\nThe OPT program has worked well for many years, allowing high skilled international students to stay and work in the United States after completing their degree. The OPT STEM extension rule is an enhancement of the OPT program as more STEM students are seeking higher education in the United States.

Those F1 students in STEM field are the best among the world. I remember when I was applying to the graduate school at Lehigh University, only the top 3%  student of my class can get the admission.  The acceptance rate is even lower for more prestigious universities such as Princeton, Caltech. These students are brilliant and creative. All the countries around the world are trying their best to attract and keep those talents. For example, the  Erasmus Mundus program established by European countries is actively attracting those talents. Recently they started PhD program as well. In order to keep those talents, Japan revised its immigration control law and reduced the minimal residence length for citizenship from 10 years to 3 years (http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/highly-skilled-foreigners-to-be-allowed-to-stay-permanently-in-japan). US has been great in attracting international talents during the past through high quality education program and STEM opt training and extension program. Through OPT, they can experience the culture of US companies, which eventually would help to recruit them and strengthen the workforce. If the opt extension is discontinued, the leadership of US in STEM field would be damaged, particularly considering all other countries are actively attracting those talents. If that happened, I can foresee that many students will apply to other countries for their study and work.\n\nSecond, it is shortsighted and harmful to the US competitiveness in the world if the international students are deprived of the OPT training opportunities. OPT students are not competing with americans on jobs like cashiers in the Walmart, attendants in McDonalds. Instead, they are working on the cutting edge of engineering, science, such as 3D printing, personalized drug delivery, high performance computing in national defense, etc. Those fields are crucial to any country in the world.

What is worse, those students will use their talents to compete against US  if US has to send them back to their home country. It is an even dumb decision considering that US has spending a lot of funding and resources training them. \n\nTo sum up, I strongly support the STEM OPT extension for both the national comprehensive competitiveness and the benefits to the general US people.  \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ford TJ", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16822", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is beneficial for companies to hire more extraordinary people to contribute to American society.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qi Zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1077", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This rule will increase the amount of highly skilled workforce available to companies in need of STEM workers.

Currently employers who have invested lots of time and money on the STEM OPT employees are not ready to withdraw/lose so many employees in their company all of a sudden.

It is INSANE to fail this proposal so that we will lose quite a lots of protential RESOURCES in the firm and have the urgent need to fill those positions with unnessary alternatives. \n\n2. The government should encourage the students who have learned knowledge from the best U.S. universities to stay in the countries, to CONTRIBUTE to our GDP. \n\n3. We definitely want to encourage the DIVERSITY of our working place as well as on campus. Void this proposal will hurt it really badly. We started as a country building with immigrants and we should appreciate this, and continue to enbrace this diversity. \n\n4. I agree that this will increase the human capital competition in the job market, but it is NEVER a bad thing to have more COMPETITION. These STEM OPT employees may increase the competitiveness of the job market in a COMPLEMENTARY way: they can perfectly fill in the positions which our natives are not good at, or do not care to do. We employers are not studid. None of our employers is stupid enough to hire internationals, and give up the natives, if their skillsets do not match. We need this good competition to stay in the market to increase our competitive advantage in the global environment.

It is not only important for the non-immigrants but also the for the US government, it will increase the economy as well as in the IT sector. There are many international people in the good positions like CEO's of the Google, Microsoft etc they proved their talent.. if they didn't have that OPT how they would be in that position. So as we would like to prove our talent and make proud to the company as well as country am working in.  Please give equal opportunities to the citizens and non-citizens of US.

That way, STEM student will have longer time to work in the U.S and make much larger contributions to this country. \n\nFirst, the U.S, in order to develop economy, needs large amounts of people with STEM background, and merely hiring U.S citizens or permanent residents are far from enough: there are still large gaps needed to be filled. The foreign student are just the right person to do this. \n\nSecond, these highly educated people are precious resources to the U.S. Foreign student who can achieve STEM degree in U.S are all excellent in their own countries. If OPT EXTENSION is extended, they will have more chances to stay here and make more contributions to America. The U.S only spends couple of years to nurture them, but they bring back much more value.\n\nThird, they are very diligent. It's hard for STEM students to compete with citizens, so they must be more sedulous and much less picky about jobs. That makes them spare no effort to provide high quality work to make sure they stay in the companies. \n\nFinally, they will not threat the chances of citizens. The economy of the U.S is recovering and the need for work force in STEM major is larger than citizen. And OPT EXTENSION only includes STEM majors, the citizens concentrates more on majors like literature, economy, art, etc. So foreign student will only be a great supplement to the need. \n\nIn sum, I am positive this proposal will benefit the U.S not just in short term but strategically in long run.

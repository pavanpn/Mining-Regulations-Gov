The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by A.K.

It will significantly advance U.S. national interests by attracting and maintaining more talented students in STEM majors to contribute their knowledge and skills to the U.S. economy. STEM students will help boost productivity in certain business areas such as IT, reduce potential costs, and finally creating even more jobs for local American people. For example, Mike Krieger, who was born in Brazil, co-founded Instagram which not only created thousands of jobs but increased the competitive strength of U.S. IT sector in the global markets. \n\n2. It will not affect the career opportunities of local U.S. students. The majority of students in U.S. graduate engineering schools are international students, which means few American students face direct competition from international students in the job market. In addition to that, there is no incentive for U.S. employers to favor international students than local students. Local students usually speak better English, fit better into the working environment, and have more flexibility to switch to different companies and fields to strengthen their job skills. STEM students only serve to fill the highly demanding jobs that U.S. students either aren't interested or don't qualify. \n\n\nI hope the bill will be passed to meet the expectation of both numerous U.S. companies as well as international students.

A lot of places can be improved along with this proposed role and a more matured training system can be realized. U.S.'s career market is demanding STEM talents and with their work, numerous social value can be generated, which is a good thing to U.S.' economics and technology.\nFinally, these international STEM students are students who accept the highest education of U.S. and dream of contributing to the development of science and technology in the most advanced country in the world.

First of all jobs are meant to be done in an efficient and quality way in order to help others in many different ways. It's beneficial to the whole society. and because of this USA became the greatest country in the world. But the effectiveness and quality of the job doesn't depend on who did the job, citizen or not.  The only thing matters is that if you are qualified or not. As long as the standard holds, american citizens shouldn't worry about who did the job. since no matter who did the job, the american citizens will benefit from it. And second, no one will take over your jobs since no jobs belong to anyone, otherwise there is no purpose for people to apply the job. Think about the probability the citizen will get a job will drop if more international students are given the OPT. That's simply a nonsense unless you believe that applying for a job is to draw a lottery. American citizens should be more confident no matter how many people are competing with you.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and will graduate in Dec, 2015 with a master's degree in the field of Electrical Engineering. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nShwetang Peshin", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shwetang Peshin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19397", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Strongly agree!\nThis new extension rule give student better chance to practice in turn to strength the knowledge they learn in university.

Allowing such an extension is beneficial to both the citizens of US as well as foreigners seeking careers in research and industry. I personally believe that US is a country that respects talent and hard work and helps people who are working towards a better future irrespective of their race or nationality.\nThe general argument made by people who are against this rule is that it will devoid US citizens of their jobs. But this argument is very faulty as they fail to understand that when a company hires a person, the company is mainly assessing the potential employee on grounds of skills and talent and not based on race or nationality. Denying the industry's and society's need for the desired skill and talent will be very detrimental to the society which the public fails to see. In such a huge macroeconomic society it is very wrong to decide that foreigners are taking away jobs of native people. Indirectly, immigrants bring a lot of influx of capital and create jobs.\nThere are many examples that can prove that welcoming talent (irrespective of race or nationality) has always been very beneficial to the US society. Few examples are, Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google was a Russian immigrant. Google has employed many Americans and has contributed to the country's wealth by a great deal. Dr. Raj Reddy, Turing award winner and the Moza Bint Nasser University Professor of Computer Science and Robotics in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University an early pioneer in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics is an Indian immigrant because of whom many breathtaking innovations were possible. These are some of the many great works done by immigrants.\nThroughout the history of the United States, many technical innovations were possible by the joint effort of Americans and immigrants. The freedom provided by US to people to study, work and research with equality is what has made her the greatest nation in the world.\nI give a small example of what the effect of not providing visa relief for students will cause. Please refer the following article. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/chasing-the-american-dream-in-india\nIf Mr. Kunal Bahl were given visa relief, he would've stayed in US and created a company here and employed several thousand US citizens and would have contributed to her GDP too. Now imagine the loss for US if she were to send many thousand skilled and talented students back to their home countries without providing an opportunity to contribute to the American society.\nI believe the US will continue to honour hard work and the will of people to create a better future for humanity together by relaxing visa restrictions for students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Harun Rashid Anver", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21552", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We have seen that extention of OPT has made great contribution to American's society in terms of technologies.

The money is then used to hire better professors and pay scholarships to US college students. If only 12 months OPT is granted, US will become a much less desirable destination for foreign students to further their study. In this case, universities have to cut their expenses including giving less scholarships, which would make education even harder for US citizens.\n\nSecond, US has been a leading country in science and technology industries, and no one can deny that foreign workers play a key role in helping the country maintain its leadership role. For example, look at the faculty list of any university, it is not surprising that many professors have foreign origins. If suddenly US loses many top performing foreign workers in STEM fields, the economy will surely get negative impacts immediately, which may even threaten US's leading position in science and technology among all the competing countries. \n\nThird, OPT students in STEM fields are definitely not, and will never become, vicious competitors of American college students. It is NOT true that companies prefer OPT students, on the contrary, it is much harder for international students to get a job than native American students. Many STEM companies/jobs are reserved for citizens and are never reachable for foreign students. For the limited job positions that foreign students can apply, they will only be considered if really no native candidates meet the hiring bar. As a matter of fact, companies know that foreign students' work permission is temporary, thus they would prefer to hire native students who can work long enough for them without having to leave due to OPT expires.\n\nFourth, there are already many examples of foreign people starting small tech companies, especially in Silicon Valley. These small companies are growing and providing more and more job opportunities for native American people. Their founders, are or were once, OPT students. This again proves, to make native American people's life better, the correct approach is NOT to shut the door for foreign students, but to allow them to practice their dreams and innovations and be part of the leading workforce that is changing the country's STEM industries constantly.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jiao Yu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14244", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I sincerely agree with and support the proposal to extend international students' OPT related to stem majors.

One important thing to mention is that this does not have any adverse effect on American workers: the amount of H1B distributed each year still remains the same, which means that THERE WILL NOT BE MORE NEW IMMIGRATION. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GET A WORKING VISA IS STILL THE SAME. It only affects the people who want to get H1B with more people in the drawer compete for the same number of visas.\n\nAlso, it is an extension for STEM students only. These are highly educated people in science, which pretty much can affect every aspect of a country nowadays. Not allowing them to stay means that they will have to be back to their country with the advanced knowledge they learn here, and good luck to the U.S. after 10 years or 20 years when these people have become the mainstay of their own countries. Imagine: North Korean student who has been studying theoretical physics all his life in America and suddenly he has to go back to his home country... we all know how nuclear bomb was invented right? YOU DON'T WANT TO CREATE YOUR ENEMYS. America is what it is because it takes in immigration, those who are intelligent and hard-working. It is what pushes the U.S. forward. If it is less attractive for smart people because of OPT, I can foresee the future of American's academia. Simply look at how many STEM professors are new immigrants and you will understand.\n\nLastly, I'm confused about the concept of the whole STOP NEW IMMIGRATION. I mean, how many people in America now are not the products of new immigration? Or even they themselves are new immigrants? I want to laugh at people who say they are \"native\", unless they are really native Americans. What defines \"native\" anyways? I was born and raised in one city but then traveled to another city and grew up there, and now I worked in yet another city. Most likely your parents, or grandparents, or great grandparents will be from somewhere else outside the U.S.. \n\nLet me end with a question: Would you accept Albert Einstein as your fellow American citizen?

There is no benefit for American STEM students, only a miniscule benefit for current American STEM workers, and absolutely no benefit for the average American taxpayer.\n\nForeign students: \n-They will be better positioned for a career in their field\nNote what the \"Initial Regulatory Impact Analysis\" document indicates:  The STEM Optional Practical Training program will \"ensure students gain valuable practical STEM experience that supplements knowledge gained through their academic studies. By earning a functional understanding of how to apply that knowledge in a work setting, students will be better positioned to begin careers in their fields of study.\" (pg. 8). \n\"With respect to benefits, making the STEM OPT extension available to additional students and extending the current 17-month extension will enhance students' ability to achieve the objectives of their courses of study by gaining valuable knowledge and skills through on-the-job training that is often unavailable in their home countries.\" (pg. 12)\n\t-They will get the same wages as current U.S. workers\nNote the following: The proposed rule would require \"compensation that is commensurate with that paid to similarly situated U.S. workers and that complies with appropriate labor laws.\"\n\t-They would get a longer time to draw these wages\nNote the following: \"This proposed rule, if made final, would extend to 24-months the previous 17-month OPT extension program for STEM graduates; allow eligible students two STEM OPT extensions in their lifetime....\"(pg. 9)\n\t-They are not required to pay Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes.\n\t-They will have the opportunity for permanent long-term employment with the same company or with another company since there is nothing that forbids this.\n\nSTEM Employers\nWhy is DHS concerned about better positioning foreigners to begin careers in their fields of study?  The obvious conclusion is that this Administration considers these students to be potential long term cheap labor for the STEM employers after their OPT time.  Foreign STEM OPT students can move into some other visa category after their STEM OPT time is complete.  The employers can then retain them without interruption or work to employ them under another visa category at a lower wage than American STEM workers.  This is, of course, what the employers ate counting on.  The lower wages and benefits than American workers would be a boon to employers.  \nSince the OPT workers are  still technically \"students\", the employers will not have to payroll taxes for the three years a worker is in the program.\n\nUniversities\nNote the following:\n\"The proposed changes would also help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States.\" (pg. 8)\n\"The proposed rule will benefit the U.S. educational system by helping ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international students in STEM fields.\" (pg. 12)\nThis Administration is interested in keeping the money flowing into the coffers of Big Education and maintaining the flow of foreign students into STEM fields in the U.S.\n\nAmerican STEM Students\n\t-There is no provision for American STEM students to receive anything to enhance their career prospects.\n\nAmerican STEM Workers\n\t-The proposed rule only requires that an employer \"attest that it will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student.\" (pg61)  Under this Administration, investigation of employers for violations of immigration law has been virtually nonexistent.  So there will be no enforcement of this requirement. \n\t-The proposal only requires employers to pay STEM OPT students wages that are \"commensurate compensation and report those wages through the Mentoring and Training Plan. The certification and wage requirements are steps to ensure that the STEM OPT extension has no unintended consequences for the U.S. labor market.\"  So apparently the employer decides and attests to what is \"commensurate compensation\".  Notice that the certification and wage requirements do not ensure that the U.S. workers do not ultimately experience \"unintended\" loss of employment. \n-There is no provision to prevent employers from displacing American workers and hiring the foreigners at any time after their OPT work period has been completed. \n\nAmerican Taxpayers\n\t-There is absolutely no benefit of any kind for the average American taxpayer.\n\t-But the taxpayer ends up paying the expenses of administering the program and the expenses associated with the assisting displaced American workers.  \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fred Bush", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20065", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a very good initiative giving the brightest student all over the world pursuing science and engineering degrees in US.

This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 36 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 36-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nNishanth ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Nishanth reddy Tirupathi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10290", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "With all due respect, I approve of STEM OPT.

For the U.S. to stay competitive in terms of science and technology, we need to attract global talents and make the stay and work for American based companies. If we drive them out after they finish study, they will simply go back to their home country or whatever countries that welcome highly skilled STEM workers. They are not contributing to US economy in anyway without actually staying here and in so doing, we let go the best of the talents and let them create the next Alibaba or Tencent. Worse still, they may not even come to the US without the promise of at least working for a period of time after they graduate. Think about what this will bring to US colleges and grad schools and the academic researches in general.\n\n2. The extension is necessary to further attract STEM talents to the US. One year of working experience may well be too short for the students to be more competitive in the job market after they return to their home country, therefore, plays a negative role when a foreign student considers studying in the US for higher education. It simply is not worth the education investment, which goes well beyond 100,000 in most cases.\n\n3. International students studying in STEM fields are not taking jobs away from the US workers. Recent years, STEM fields, especially computer science, have huge demands for skilled workers which US born graduates along cannot meet. It is common in STEM majors in universities that international students far outnumber American students. How much of a gap will it leave if all of these international students are not allowed to work after they graduate? And how hard will this hit US economy? Probably very bad. Moreover, the tech companies, without sufficient skilled workers in the job market, are very likely to outsource their job to countries like India, or China, where they will find very cheap labor, at a somewhat lower quality. This will most likely bring down the wages of American born STEM students, which is counter-effective.\n\n3.

And as the answer for some of the oppositions, I have four points to share with everybody: \n\nFirst of all, the whole point of STEM OPT extension is to keep the International human intelligence resources in the United States while there is a gap between graduation and the granting of working VISA. Upon the cancellation of OPT extension, the US industry would lose hundreds of thousands of employees immediately. Considering the huge amount of financial and human resources that are already invested in hiring and training these International employees, this would be a heavy blow onto the economy in the United States. In the long run, a compromised financial situation would cause the cut-off of more positions, even US citizens would be involved and won't be lucky. Opponents, you'd better be smart and think about the consequences. \n\nSecond, competition from International students are NOT decreasing the chances for citizens in getting their job.  These International students, when they get the job offer, they have already shown much more qualification than their US citizen peers, because companies need to advertise for the same position around citizens and prove no citizen can do this job before they can hire this International student. For the citizens, if they fail to get a job, that doesn't mean that their chance has been decreased due to the competition from International students, but because of they are NOT QUALIFIED for what they apply for. In addition, even if competition exists, competition is not a bad thing. \n\nThird, the number of STEM job positions is expected to be increasing (http://www.ed.gov/stem) by 14-62% during 2010-2020. As more positions are open, the need of human intelligence is increasing.\n\nLast but not the least, United States, has always been a country that loves diversity. When tracing back to hundreds of years, everyone's ancestor used to be a foreigner, except for the American Indians. For the opponents claiming that International students are foreigners, why don't you move back to where your great-grand parents live? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jiajie Huang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18828", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I firmy agree with this rule", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Praveen Dasari", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1201", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM students do all the original brilliant and hard job for American.\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Junwei zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11755", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Why would anyone think they could justify displacing American workers with foreigners?

I have read through many of the comments against the ruling, and very unfortunately people got wrong impression of what does this OPT extension do. \n\nFirst, the purpose of the STEM OPT program is to provide a training program for STEM students who would like to obtain hands-on experience in real world before they leave school, and to work with American coworkers in a goal oriented environment. This program does not warrant a green card, nor a working VISA. The beneficiaries of this ruling are essentially students -- this is a temporary immigration status, and will terminate at the end of the program. This temporary status will not impact number of jobs available to US workers who are aiming at a long employee-employer relationship, since the employer will count this factor in when hiring STEM OPT students. In other words, the STEM OPT hires are an extended internship offered for international students, and as stated in its title, this program is optional, and for practical training purpose only. Anyone who compare OPT with a full time, long term job did not understand the purpose of this ruling. The issue of foreign workers competing with local workers in job market and potential consequence leading to lower wages shall be categorized as part of the H1B cap discussion, not the OPT extension discussion.\n\nSecondly, this ruling has already set protections to local workers who are seeking jobs. The program require a formally installed training/mentor program of the company who hires STEM OPT students. The layoff protection again put the OPT students at the front line of a company downsizing at the necessary moment, which provide a comfort buffer to US workers in such dreadful moments. The ruling writers have put much of their thoughts and results of research into the details, they're just so easily overlooked because people usually stopped at the first few paragraphs stating that STEM students are staying longer. This isn't a fair judgement, not even to those who put efforts in reducing even the minimal impact of this ruling to those local workers who could have been affected.  \n\nThirdly, the companies are no longer hiring people on a long mutually bounded terms any more. The union-worker hiring mode is no longer fitting in the working environment of the fast pacing, information era high tech companies. In this perspective, everyone is a contractor to the company: you can leave the company at will, and if the most unfortunate moment falls upon you, the company fires you at will. The impression of job security has already shifted from the vicinity of \"getting a job and that's done\". The competition is fair to everyone in the same working environment. And as some of you have already noted, the local workers already have the advantage in language fluency and much less communication barrier. The installment of the OPT program does not create a biased, lower waged positions particularly set for STEM OPT students. The positions are open for hire to anyone who think he or she can be a good fit. It is not hiring an OPT student that make the wages growth at low pace, it is the recovery of the economy and over supplied work force that dragging that done. And in the vicinity where most OPT students are hired, this is not even a case -- it's just so hard to find a qualified local worker that the company has to increase the hiring cost to fetch OPT holders in order to fill the badly needed positions.\n\nIn conclusion, this ruling is a fair deal not only to foreign students who would like to extend their STEM OPT terms, but also to those eagerly job seeking local workers. This ruling has set a good example at balancing the benefits from both parties affected by the ruling.

The reasons are as follow:\n1. For international students, the most appealing part to study in US is its OPT program. Without extended OPT, we can expect significantly less talented international students go to US for their graduate studies, especially in STEM area. This will be a bad thing for international academic collaboration between US university and the rest of the world, and have negative effects for US to maintain its leading position in Science and Technology.\n\n2. Normally, it takes a new comer about half a year to be familiar with all the routine work in a company. If the OPT is only 12 months, before the employee can generate some revenue for the company, they are going to leave. This will definitely be hazardous to the profit of US company as well as taxation.\n\n3. High tech international students contributes a lot for the US technology and economic growth. And because of the technology industry grows, more and more US citizens would like to learn STEM majors than before.  And because of the competition from international students, Americans will work harder to study the new technology and that is a positive cycle. \n\n4. Without OPT extension, these talented students will work for other companies outside US with the knowledge learned from US schools and compete with the US companies. Some of them may create their own companies to earn US companies market and there will have less jobs for Americans.\n\n5.  Don't forget why we have OPT extension before, because US companies cannot find such talented American students. If you have concerned about unfair salary or taxation, you can set a rule to let the companies show their salary reports and let all employees pay Social Security Tax and Medicare tax.

There is no doubt that F-1 students with STEM degrees have made great contributions to the US economy especially in the areas of technology and science. For the past couple years, international students with STEM degrees have become an indispensable work force in most technology companies and have helped with the industry advancement through innovation and hardworking. With an extended OPT, these international students will have higher chance to contribute to the companies and therefore push the whole US economy to a new level. On the other hand if the extension is revoked, those F-1 students will have to leave the country and the companies they are working for will lose a huge amount of talents. The impact is indeed significant that we can not simply neglect. Also having them going back to their own countries will waste all the education resources U.S have provided them through their undergraduate or graduate years. This outflow of talents will definitely decrease our competence and contribute to their home country's overall growth. \n\nIn addition, having international students work in the country will cultivate a diversified environment which enhances the exchange and innovation of ideas. It will also bring different perspectives to discussions that helps to achieve an optimal solution.\n\nOne concern that people may have against the extension is that, with more and more international students looking for jobs in the States, it increases the competition for the local residents to be employed. This is a real concern in the past couple years during  post financial crisis period. However, as U.S economy recovered and with unemployment rate dropping to 5%, the lowest in 7 years, U.S markets nowadays definitely have the capacity to provide more jobs and thus keeping international students working in the country will not be a threat to the local residents.  \n\nTherefore I believe extending OPT time is definitely a regulatory that brings more advantages than disadvantages to the whole america society.

If no one could build a great product for the company, I am sure the business will have a huge impact after that. Guess who will be the next one be affect? Business team people! All the American will face loss their job if the company's business shrunk. The company don't need as much as business people as before, of cause from company side, they will fire business team people, who majority are American. \n\nThe next thing would happened after all the student who can not use their OPT extension is, they will go back to their own country. And all the other countries will have great employee back to work for their tech company. This will make other countries' tech company grow very fast and then will have a negative impact to American company again. American company will have even less business compare with before, which will cause more and more business people lose their jobs. \n\nIt is not international STEM students have less challenging interview process to get the job, however its the opposite way, we are facing even more difficulty process to get a job because we are not American. If we go back to our own country, the company we are working for will have to hire less fit in people to do our job and one thing is lower the hiring bar to get people hired. This will definitely affect the product build process. All the better engineers went back to their own countries, left less fit in people work for American company will definitely affect their product building. The next thing is the business be impact by the global more competitive tech companies' product. More business people will be fired, who are American. \n\nI guess all the companies want the best people in one area to make the company grow. Why can not we keep OPT extension, make the company under a positive grow path without impact the business team American people? Why can not we give all people equal right to chose if they want to work for American company or go back to their own country following their heart?

I would say the STEM-OPT extension policy benefits not just our new grads, but the company and Americans as well.

I am not saying the fast booming of the company is only because of the hiring of international student, but we do have an significant contribution. In our company, engineers are also responsible for the customer service, for there are lots of technical problems, and since we have customer from all over the world, it is better for the company to have engineers who understand them better. This year, we have around ten people joining our company, and at least half of them are Americans, so the saying of hiring international students would take over Americans positions is not likely to be true, at least for our company.\nHaving the extension is crucial for company to fully benefited from international students. As a new hire, it will take some time to really understanding the job and also the company, so maybe only after the first year, can these new employees be a real asset for the company. Besides, even though we are not citizens, we still pay all the taxes and made our contributions to the American economy. In the end, I would say I strongly agree with this policy, and I believe it will keep benefiting both sides.\n\nRegards,\nChen Xu", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chen Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17150", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This would be of great help to the F1 students this should be given a genuine consideration", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Radhika Suresh", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22527", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a great idea.

Many companies offer positions for American citizens only by simply not sponsoring work visa at all. I went to many career fairs during college years and it was normal that only a small fraction of the companies there would accept my resume. Furthermore, it is the same opportunity for everyone and it is natural that the best one wins. After foreign students apply for the job, we have to go through rounds of interviews, competing against fellow American/foreign applicants, and only get the job if we are considered competent and most suitable for the position. Foreign students need to work very hard to score a job and we withstand tests before we receive the job offer. People who are saying that we steal their jobs are just sore losers who wish companies would just hand them jobs because no one else can apply. Based on this logic, if they lose the competition to other American citizens, they would probably want to shut out people from those states.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chenghan Zou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7305", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "AMERICAN STUDENTS COME FIRST WITH ME.

The proposed expansion would allow U.S. businesses to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent U.S. college graduates, who have the required qualifications to satisfy the position requirements of the business hiring to fill the position, struggling to find employment, it is not the province of DHS to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizen employees over U.S. citizens. The proposed rule arbitrarily and effectively decreases the cost to the business of filling its position offered with a lower cost foreign employee. This proposed rule would establish by default, a Federal government subsidization of the business doing the hiring distorting the free market in establishing the prevailing wage for employees with the requisite skills required of the position being filled. This proposed rule would permanently lower the prevailing wage, thus, promulgating a mass hiring of foreign citizen graduates over available, qualified U.S. college graduates who are citizens.

Companies in the high-tech segment value long-term benefits from hiring a new employee. Hiring qualified and smart people is the highest priority for us, not considering nationalities and citizenship. Given the current system, if two employees are equally qualified, one is a U.S. citizen and the other is not, the citizen is already favored over the foreign student because of the complication and cost of hiring foreigners.\n\nThe opposition of this rule argued that STEM students are getting their jobs and causing unemployment for US nationals. Its simply not true. Some people should not blame their inability to find a job on excuses like this. Hiring qualified candidates is the only concern for the companies. In addition, the high-tech companies are also not paying less to the STEM students compared to their US counterparts. The standard is the same regardless of the employees race, gender and nationality. So its also invalid to blame the companies for hiring foreign students to cut the cost. \n\nSTEM OPT exists because foreign students need time to apply and secure H1 status, given the current lower and lower probability of getting it. Helping these STEM students get H1 status eventually is essential for the students themselves and the their employers businesses. These qualified and smart foreign students not only wont cause unemployment for US nationals, they actually contribute a lot to innovative technologies, to the growth of US economy and the creation of more jobs. Expelling highly skilled foreign students out of the country will only harm the US job market and not going to help under-qualified people get a job. \n\nThe United States is the greatest nation on the planet because it embraces the best minds all over the world.

Let's take a look of the CS and ECE departments of the top 20 universities. The majority of the students and most of the top students comes from the under developed countries like China and India.

If we deprive these foreign STEM students of the opportunity to stay in US for 3 years, then most high-tech companies could not thrive in lack of competent talents. Furthermore, the tax paid by these companies could have contributed to educating more American engineers, but now they go out of business, leaving no tax, no job, no talents to the United States.\n\nAssume that some companies prosper without hiring more foreign students. Then they are gonna face another challenge in the trend of globalization :international competitions. High-tech companies like Xiaomi, Meditek and Flipkart are eager to absorb talents graduated in US universities. Fine, these guys come back to their motherland countries and leave job for american youths and then they help the companies from the other countries to seize the market shares of U.S. companies, which makes some american youths out of work again. Obviously, it is hard for U.S. to keep the leading role in the STEM field without keeping these young engineers on this land.

Hence, my personal opinion is that such a rulemaking should be passed.\n    As everyone knows, the United States is a contury of immigration. Under the statement from the Declaration of Independence that \"all men are created equal\", this country welcomes immigrants, overseas students and foreign visitors from every corner of the world. As one of the most well-known nonimmigrant citizen groups, the overseas students holding F1 visas comprise possibly the largest number of well educated foreign visitors in this country. Their knowledge and skills not only bring a positive influence on our academic environments, but also to our high-tech industry as well. This is especially true for those students with STEM majors. Therefore, an extension of the F1 OPT periods would definitely make a positive effect on attracting more talented students, and in turn make progress in high-tech industry (IT as one of the most profound examples).\n    There have been opposing opnions about the rulemaking that such an extension would bring more employment competition with the native citizens. My viewpoint is that such argument might not be a valid one. There are several reasons: first, most US citizens in unemployment status have no bachelor's degrees [1], so the competition brought upon by the OPT extension would be minimal. Second, one needs to do the correct arithmetic in order to compute a real influence of the rulemaking: since the rulemaking just extends the OPT period from 17 months to 24 months, the increasement in the number of F1 students would be about half of the annual bachelar graduates (a conservative estimation since definitely not all of the F1 students would stay on OPT). Take the number of [2], this number in 2013 is about 0.5 * 100,000 = 50,000. Compared to the total unemployent number (about 7 million), this is really a very small additional source of job competitors, and thus should not count as \"big influence\". \n    Economical considerations also serve as a basis for the support of this rulemaking. We have to admit that the US's economy has not been in a very good state in the recent years, and the truth of the college education in US is, a large portion of the tuition in almost every university is being contributed by overseas F1 students. It is not hard to imagine the negative effects that the compression of OPT periods would bring to the universities' financial wellness, once the F1 students find themselves harder to stay in US and thus more willing to choose other conturies than US.\n    As a conclusion, the group of F1 students is making great contribution to the development of US's high-tech industries and other fields requiring deep knowledge, and hence should be encouraged to stay with the help of law regulation. I believe the support argument above is strong enough and I've also pointed out some mistakes in common negative opinions by citing, comparing data from different sources.  \n\n[1] Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey\n      http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm\n[2] International STEM Students Will Benefit from Obamas Executive Action \n     http://www.wesstudentadvisor.org/2015/01/international-stem-students-will.html#.dpufhttp://www.wesstudentadvisor.org/2015/01/international-stem-students-will.html", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yusi Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20056", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "There is no doubt that OPT extension is beneficial for both America and common American people.

STEM workers are the driving force of the innovation of the technology, which is essential to the job creation and the continuous economic growth in the US. Their unique set of skills make them high in demand in high-tech and research-based industries, both have huge influence in the current economic environment. Sending the STEM students back to their home countries force those companies to outsource their work to other countries, such as India and China, because there are simply not enough US workers to supply the demand in talent. This is proved by companies keep hiring international students even though it costs companies a lot more to do so than hiring US workers.\n2. The STEM students pay just as much tax as US citizens if they work in the US. If companies ended up outsourcing a lot of the work, the US would not be getting any tax by the contractors who work overseas for these companies.\n3. Sending those STEM students back right after they graduate (or after one year, which isn't a motivation for most students to stay at all) is an extreme waste of the educational resources and the workforce for America. Even worse, the ability to be trained on the job after they graduate is a huge motivation for the foreign students to choose American universities to begin with. If this proposed rule could not not go through, it is almost certain that the admission to American institutions for the following years would drop drastically, which would affect not only the economy, but also the native US students. The tuition would rise for rest of the students, because international students usually make a significant contribution to their school's finances by paying tuition and housing. Many native students would miss out on the multicultural experience that they expect coming into colleges.

For most of STEM students, they have 29 month in total but at least using 1/3 it to find a job, they need more time to practice their skills, to involve in the US society.\n \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Larry  Jiang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16216", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\n\nSubject: John Legal vs. Juan Illegal\n\nYou have two families: \"John Legal\" and \"Juan Illegal\".

I think it was written reasonably with the various stakeholders in mind.\n\nI was glad to see a provision for employer training and mentoring programs (section V.D) , although that may turn into a barrier for graduates working with small employers who view this as a staffing burden.  Nonetheless, such a provision should enhance the overall work experience of our graduates.\n\nI believe 24 months of STEM extension employment would be an improvement to the educational experience for students (section III.B).  Students can acquire substantial work experience over 36 months (total including the initial period of OPT) assuming there's little unemployment.\n\nI was also relieved to see that students would report changes in name, address, and employer info. (name and address) directly to DHS (III.B).  It's very difficult to get graduates to keep in touch with us after graduation since we don't have much of a carrot to dangle.  The longer they are out (post-college), the more difficult this becomes.  This proposed requirement makes worlds of sense!\n\nAs for students submitting an evaluation of his or her STEM OPT every six months to their DSO (V.D.), I am not sure that all DSO's are qualified to assess if graduates are truly meeting their goals.  I sometimes have just a basic understanding of what students are doing likely because both of my degrees are in the social sciences.  I don't believe such a designation is appropriate for many administrative employees of colleges and universities.  I also know that students will not consistently meet this requirement.  It's been burdensome to comply with the validation reporting requirements since students often don't stay in touch with us, regardless of requirements.  I'd urge DHS to please reconsider this provision.\n\nFinally, I wholeheartedly support a second period of STEM OPT being available to students who obtain a second qualifying STEM degree (V.B).  I also think it's very wise to allow students to work in the field of a previously earned qualifying degree, providing that the degree is from an accredited institution and the work would be directly related to that STEM major (V.F).  I appreciate the flexibility this provision demonstrates.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\t\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\tthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\t\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\tthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n\t\"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:\n\t\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\t\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\nRon Hira of Howard University: \n\t\"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.\"\n\nDaniel Costa, of the Economic Policy Institute:\n\tthe worker protections included in the new rule \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.\"\n\nIan Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute:\n\tDHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n\t\"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\"\n\nThis proposed change is a disaster for American workers and for national security. \n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chad Crawford", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4405", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates.

Why would foreign people choose to study in US? What is the advantages of universities of US over universities of other countries? I ask several friends for answers of that. What they told me is that US have better chances for intern and full time jobs,  which makes them more competitive in the job market when they go back to their countries after the OPT. If OPT is cancelled, US universities would lose their most significant advantages immediately, since other countries like The Britain or Australia can also provide excellent education with much lower tuition fee. To sustain the competition of universities and to attract more outstanding and wealthy foreign students to choose US for their higher education, I highly suggest that the OPT extension policy should be sustain and extended. \n\nIn the same time, US is the most powerful country in the world. To sustain its hegemony position, the countries need to know more about its competitors. And to know more and win from other countries, foreign students are the best source for US to know better about the world. For example, it is critical for US company who plan to develop globally to hire foreign students ,who knows culture of US and also their home countries, and they can provide better advices for the US company to develop their business in foreign countries correctly. Those foreign students are treasures for those global US companies. And one year OPT is obviously not enough for those companies to train and explore foreign market. Longer OPT means more reliable employees, which is beneficial to both employer and employees. The formal can better use the value of their employees, and the latter would acquire more competition when they go back to their home countries for longer developments.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jiali Chen, Oracle", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8186", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.

OPT Extension (24-month) along with 12-month OPT will help international STEM students significantly because academic, private or public organizations/companies require both academic knowledge and practical experience.\n\nPlease add Geography (CIP code 45.0701) in the STEM list. A paper was published in a peer reviewed journal why geography should be included as STEM (doi:10.5539/jgg.v7n1p27): http://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jgg/article/view/43858/24468\n\nAlso, please make \"exit and re-entry\" easy for international students. Initial OPT was 12 months and travelling outside of U.S. was no big deal for that periods. However, now students need to travel home and come back in 36-month period (OPT 12 month and STEM extension 24 month).

But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nFor more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigrants from around the world into our nation to enhance our diversity, culture, and economy, which has been the most important reason for this nation's success. Many other countries are trying to learn our successful experience. Recently, Chinese government has proposed 8 new rules about new \"green card\" policy to attract talents from around the world. The short comes of current H-1B strategy has already make many skilled talents leaving this country. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt called it a \"Brilliant strategy,\" he said \"We take very, very smart people, bring them into the country, give them a diploma and kick them out where they go on to create companies that compete with us.\" Without the availability of a STEM extension, things can only be getting worse. \nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sherry Lee", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11419", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a international student, I think OPT is a part of the whole study in U.S. Also, as a STEM student, it is necessary to get more time to practice.

A lot of international students here value the working experience very much for their future career development when they go back to their own countries. Less students means less education earnings, less related job opportunities, and less people contributing to the researches.\n\nOn the contrary, everyone can benefit from the rule:\n1. For American citizens. \nLet's see where the competition happens. As this rule is restricted in STEM, most qualified students are in high tech industry, meaning that it will have little impact on the most employees in other areas. The prosperity in high tech will definitely benefit other industries, bringing more job opportunities for Americans. Even in high tech industry, the competition is not decided by the international students, but the worldwide high tech market, let alone the small number of qualified international students compared to the total employee number.\n2. For companies.\nThey have longer time to select the right person to hire. \n3. For qualified international students.\nThey can have more practical training, and accumulate working experience for their future career.\n\nWhile I do have some suggestion:\nIt would be great if the applicable scope can be expanded to some other majors in addition to STEM.

Their knowledge and experience can make great contribution to US-based companies and organizations, and thus US economy. If these graduates cannot get work authorization in US, they are forced to return to their home countries and work for other companies competing with US companies. For example, China has been a great rivalry to US in all aspects, and each year, there are tens of thousands of STEM students graduated from top-tier universities in US. If they are forced to return to China, they will work for Chinese companies, which compete with US companies in the market. With a labor force with best higher education in the world, Chinas innovation and competitiveness will rise dramatically in the near future. To stop this trend, The US government should try its best to keep these graduates to stay and work in this country so that they can use their knowledge and ability to profit US companies and organizations.\n\nSecond, the Optional Practical Training program, is very attractive to future foreign students. Other countries, especially European countries, does not offer work authorization to students of this scale. Thus, this is a major reason that foreign students choose this country. Foreign students pay much higher tuitions compared to local students, which becomes a significant source of funding for universities. With more funding, US universities can attract the best researchers and education professionals to continue to provide world-leading education that this country enjoys at present. In addition, foreign students contribute to US economy in many aspects such as housing, consumer products, food, auto, etc. By living and studying in this country for several years, their impact to US economy is not ineligible. Thus, the US government should make rules to attract more foreign students to study in this country, and the Proposed Rule is a strong movement towards this target.\n\nThird, many high tech companies hire a lot of foreign students every year because there are not enough domestic STEM graduates or professionals. These companies pay the same or even more compensation to attract foreign students to join. If these employees cannot obtain work authorization, companies have to move these positions overseas. If so, taxation in US will decrease. Someone may argue that if the Proposed Rule is vetoed, these jobs will go to domestic labors. This is not true. Labor market for high tech field is an international, fully competitive market. STEM graduates and domestic labors compete in the same labor market, receive the same level of compensation and work in the same job positions. A company hires STEM graduates over domestic labor simply because STEM graduates outperform.\n\nIn summary, the Proposed Rule is beneficial to US economy and competitiveness, US-based companies, and US higher education. Thus it should be passed without delay.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ryan Qian", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5898", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a student here, I feel disappointed with so many negative review against the 24 month opt extension for STEM students.

Foreign students are majority at some technical fields like computer and electrical engineering. Without the OPT extension, most of international students which are using OPT or OPT extension to work here are forced to leave the U.S which might leave a big cavities in the employment market of the U.S. That would cause the rising economy to fall down again because of lacking qualified employers.\n\n2. Though the U.S economy are not prosperous as previous years. The education and scientific research are blooming during these years which should gives the credit to the OPT. Because of OPT and extension, international students have got much chance to apply their knowledge and skills into practical. That's why most of them would choose the U.S as their target place to get education or conduct scientific research. European countries are also leading the technology and education but they can't offer such good policy for international students so that they can't match with the U.S\n\n3. Some natives might argue that OPT might lower the average salary or minimum wage. That's not the truth. There is no direct evidence or material statistics prove their argument. On the contrary, as far as I know, most international students qualified for STEM Opt extension are usually work at huge technical companies which offer them a great package salary. Some of them might event get more than a six-figure salary as an entry level employee. This kind of salary is much higher than the average salary of native citizens, how come OPT extension would cause the lower minimum wage.\n\n4.Considerable international students here even considering open their own business which might create a huge amount of job opportunity for the native citizens.\n\n5.International students who work here using OPT extension are highly educated and qualified who are good for keeping the society stability and prosperity instead of illegal immigrants said by many other comments. And the government might get a huge tax revenue from their legal income which might in turn to help the other programs like Obama Care run by the U.S government.\n\n6.Considering such many good points, the one-year OPT is not that enough for both international students and for the U.S and its people. Being given more time for OPT, international students might have more opportunities to get an H1B visa which might allow them to contribute more the American society.

I felt a lot of pressure when I heard the news about the overruling of stem extension as  result of a lawsuit. It's disappointing for me because I already landed a ideal job and my company is willing to sponsor H1B but if the STEM extension is vacant next February I have to leave U.S. which I enjoy working in a lot. My company has invested many resources in me already so if they have to let me go it will be a loss for both my company and I. Thankfully, DHS shares my feeling.I was very excited to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. I strongly support this new rule as it will not only let me keep working in this country but also have a better chance to get the H1B visa since I will be able to apply for H1B twice during the 24 month extension. \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers. Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months. In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests. The 24 month OPT can also allow me to file H1B visa twice to increase the chance to get the lottery. Cap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained. Given that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nI strongly suggest the final rule will grant the students who are already approved for the 17-month extension additional 7-month extension which will help them have a better chance of obtaining H1B visa since most likely they will get one more chance to apply for H1B. This will also minimize the impact on the current 17-month extension granted students as well as the pending applications. I strongly suggest and hope this final rule would grant the additional 7-month extension to the students currently under 17-month extension. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLinwei", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Linwei Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4656", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Science student, currently studying in UK.\nJobs are for those who works hard instead of who with a certain nationality.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gloria Jia", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22175", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the DHS expansion of the OPT.

The 12 months post-completion OPT apparently does not provided enough time for STEM students to learn what the companies need, to initiative projects for improvement, or to get involved in such projects that will make real difference. They need more time to fully utilize their knowledge and expertise in STEM area and apply these abilities to contribute to their US employer's business, and ultimately, to the growth US economy.\n\n2) US students face very limited competition from STEM international students in work place. International students working with STEM OPT now do take a good amount of entry-level jobs in US science and engineering industries. However, with the limited quote of H1-B visa every year, the ability of these students further pursuing a higher level managerial position is very limited. Thus the competition between US students and STEM international students in pursuing promotions to higher level jobs is very trivial. Thus, in a long run, when developing their career to a higher level, US students are not getting pressure from STEM international students.\nOn the contrary, with extended STEM OPT, STEM international students will be able to keep making contributions to companies operations and improvement projects, which will contribute to the companies' growth, and ultimately to the growth of US economy and the increase of new work opportunities in a long run.\n\n3) The STEM OPT is a great attraction for international student who are pursuing a STEM degree to choose an US academic institution. With STEM OPT, these students, who account for a great portion of all international students, expect to be able to get effective practical experience after graduation, and will consider US institutions favorably. The STEM OPT has been, and would still be, an important positive factor for STEM international student when they are evaluating their choices of academic institution all round the world.  If US academic institutions were to lose the advantage of offering STEM OPT extension, they would certainly lose a great favorable attraction to international STEM students. This will gradually weaken US academic institutions, both financially and academically.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michelle Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11249", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This type of initiative is at the core of failing our students and citizens seeking meaningful employment", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cheryl Blackburn", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3013", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT this rule because:\n1.

International STEM students are NOT competing with American students for job opportunities; increase OPT extension time would not cause a rise in unemployment rate.\n\nI'm an electrical engineering student at a university in the Midwest. I've enrolled in the ECE program for 3 years and I've been a teaching assistant since 2015 spring.\nFrom my experience, I found the engineering school is much smaller than the business school in terms of enrolled students, but there are more international students in our engineering school. And, I found American students might take circuit courses but seldom select more advanced ECE classes, such as, electrical machines, power system analysis. In fact, most students in these courses are international. \nBasically, the STEM international students are looking for job opportunities requiring high level of expertise, which most native students are not interested in. And, I don't think the few native master students in our department have a hard time in finding jobs.

I would not deny that HCI is important for UX design. But I think design thinking, which mostly HCI students in universities don't have, but design college would teach us, is far more important than the basic knowledge of HCI. That is to say, I think HCI is the base, design thinking is more valuable than that in UX design. But design major is not in STEM! I think it is totally unfair for design students who will work for tech companies. Why we are not in STEM? Design is not only graphic design or visual design. We are designing for websites and apps. We are tech employees, not business or art. But engineers are all in STEM. UX designers, a super important role in a team, are ignored.\n\nThus, I highly recommend you to do some research on which art colleges are teaching interaction design major for tech positions.

I read the opposing comments - mostly by native Americans. And most of them show a concern with less job opportunities and blame on this policy. But I do not think this opinion holds. HRs would definitely choose native Americans over international students due to OPT restriction, provided that they have the same skills for the job.  This is because,  an international student are unlikely to serve the industry in the long run - due to the restriction of OPT deadline. So native Americans are still advantageous over foreigners and there is no necessity to worry about foreigners depriving of natives' job opportunities.  Those who shouted in the comments about less job opportunities, should look back on themselves whether you have mastered the expertise industries need for a qualified job candidate instead of blaming on incoming international students and the government.\n\nIn the long run, the importing of excellent STEM students will surely be beneficial to the prosperity of American society - and of course, create more job opportunities. The development of certain fields, whether it is a valuable scientific research achievement, or excellent students starting new businesses, will surely bring more new job opportunities.\n\nAmerica is a comprehensive and equal society.  This is why people around the world are seeking opportunities in the US. When people are discriminating against African Americans, you established laws to stop it. When LGBT groups are fighting for their rights, you approved their right of marriage. We do not think that job opportunities should be totally different just because of the difference of nationality. To sustain the status of pioneer of world's most advanced science and technology, you should also be comprehensive and equal to talents from all over the world. While it brings fiercer competition, fierce competition brings the motivation to make progress to both native and international students. \n\nYour decision changes the destiny of tens of thousands of international students, thus changes the history.

In return, the students will work and contribute to the U.S society rather than leave the country with all the knowledge and skills theyve obtained from U.S.\n\nSecondly I think as the land of brave and freedom, diversity is very important to the future of the country as it was in the past. Many international scholars and industry pioneers have done tons of important work to help the country advance and keep competitive around the world. For example, the president of my University is an asian, President Wallace Lou form the University of Maryland, who brings a lot of cooperations between UMD and those top universities in the Asia area. It is very important that the government would consider the extension of OPT seriously, given all the benefits the foreign students skilled in their major will bring to the U.S society in the upcoming several years. But now, they need the extension to keep their legal status in the U.S to find their job, a spot where they could make their contributions to the country, they just need an opportunity!\n\nI do admit that competition exists everywhere around the world, not only in the U.S. Those who are worried so bad that the foreign students will steal the opportunities of those U.S citizens could relax for the following reasons. As I know, those foreign students with STEM majors DO NOT steal the opportunities for the U.S citizens. It is just the fact the many of the the jobs now both in industry and academia require or need people who may have foreign background to help them cooperate with others around the world. As a student, I think competition is the best thing for a country like U.S to advance and keep competitive in the world. It will benefit all the people in these areas, not only the foreign students, but only the U.S. citizens themselves.\n\nWithout any doubt I will support the the proposal of the STEM OPT extension and I hope the government will consider it seriously as I  think it definitely will be a win-win decision.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by JACKIE Mu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14250", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please approve this as this is in benefit of students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ajay Tongire", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19059", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Support expanding OPT for STEM  F1 student ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Elina Ho", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16069", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose regulation OPT.

First, I want to clearly state that our immigration policy encourages us to hire US citizens unless none are available to fulfill the roles we need to fill.  In other words, we do not have a preference for hiring foreign nationals over US citizens, we simply cannot find enough qualified US citizens with the necessary skills to fuel our company's growth.\n\nWe have an active college intern program and like to hire interns when they finish school as we feel that it's a good way to partner with the academic community and enrich our own applicant pool.  If the government does not raise the cap on H-1B visas, it is imperative that we extend the length of the STEM program.  If we don't take any action, we risk losing talented employees simply because they cannot find a path to work authorization within the parameters of the existing laws.  Worse, we've had several cases where employees' jobs have been disrupted due to the expiration of their STEM when they weren't picked in the lottery.  We have had two such cases this year where employees were out of work for weeks at a time, while they waited to enter a master's program and come back to work for us under the CPT program.  These situations take a toll on the employee and on our company as we're forced to plan around these unanticipated staffing changes.  If the STEM program extended to 24 months, they would have yet another opportunity to compete for an H-1B in the lottery.  I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly disruptive these breaks in employment are to all concerned.  There has to be a better way.\n\nThe only other way to abate this crisis is to invest in skill training for American citizens so that we can more easily find qualified applicants on home soil.  Cvent supports these initiatives too and we actively partner with local schools and vocational training programs.  But our company is growing too fast for this talent pool to keep up.

Actually it is really not necessary to repeat again and again how much contribution has been made by foreign expert. In academic field, as my personal experience, I was taught by faculty originally from Italy, Germany, Japan, China and India when I was pursuing my degree in graduate school. And in industrial field, when I started working in Department of Transportation, my direct supervisor is originally from India, and the engineer sits beside me is a Hongkongese. In Silicon Valley, the engine of Information technology revolution, it is not surprising to find Asian faces working hard in the office of Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. In fact, the convenience of our life now is largely owed to the efforts of these foreign experts.  And they do not occupy more social recourse than others, while the social wealth they created is much more than most of the labors. From any aspects I did not see the reason not to offer them a platform for them to use the knowledge they learnt here.\n\nAnd on the other hand, this proposal will not, as those who oppose to it believe, lead to the problems of employment of native workers. Since effect of this proposed rule mainly covers foreigners with higher science and technology education degree  not only undergraduate but also those who has earned their Master and PhD. No matter for what country, these people are scarce resources and they always working in the positions which are not replaceable. The absolute number of this proposals target people and the position these people working on decide that they should not be responsible for the unemployment issue due to the outflow of low-end industry and occupation of low-end industry caused by immigrants lack of education.\n\nFinally, United States is not the only developed country in this world, yet why people with the cleverest mind in this planet are still prefer to leave their motherland and work in America? That is because America is the country being tolerant to foreigners. Ability, but not birth, nationality, etc., is the only factor used to judge a person. 300 years ago, it is those diligent immigrants that founded the America.

They lose talented employees and suffer from economic lost because productivity cannot be maintained and extra investment of time and money are needed to look for new candidates who are qualified for the job. To make the situation worse, those who graduate from STEM programs are trained in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. To be frank, such talents are hard to come across. The united States surely does not want to see its companies suffering from such talent loss just because their foreign workers are no longer eligible to work in this country to which they are contributing. \n\n2. The proposal helps attract more talents in the future. It is a win-win.

One of the reason is that before WWI, most of the country's government had their economic power in wages, but after WWI governments lost their ability to lower the wages in order to make the economic growth.

The reasons are following.\n\nIn recent years, information technology industry is one of the most active area in the market. However, in the university, over one half of the students who studies related major, most of them are STEM majors, are international students. These students are potential skilled works in the IT industry. If those students do not have a chance to work in the US, there would be a huge shortage of skilled works in IT industry. Because currently the leader companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, are hiring large number of international students with OPT working permit. If there's no way for the international students to make an OPT extension, after their working permit is expired, those companies would lose many employees. And this is likely to have negative impact on the industry in short term, and even have some negative impact on the US economy. \nIf it's difficult for a international STEM student to find a job after the graduation, a lot of STEM program will become less attractive to international students and they are likely trends not to apply a US STEM program. However, as the statistic data shows, NONE OF THE STEM MAJORS IS THE MOST POPULAR MAJOR IN THE US. IF THERE'S NO WAY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK, THERE WOULD BE A HUGE DECREASE OF THE NUMBER OF STEM STUDENTS. So in long term, disallowing STEM student to work in the US would have long term negative impact in IT industry and US economy. \nSince most of the job position occupied by STEM students require professional skills, and they are only allowed to take the working position that is related to the professional skills they gained from the university (and the STEM major is not the popular major in the US). That means STEM STUDENTS ARE NOT LIKELY THE CAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY FOR SOME CITIZEN TO FIND A JOB. EVEN THERE IS NO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT COMPANIES WON'T HIRE SOMEONE WITHOUT ANY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE.  As the result, the regulation is not likely to cause the negative impacts, such as increase of unemployment rate. \n\nIn a contrary,  as we can see today, the international STEM students has made many great contribution in the IT industry, and they are really important to the prosperity of the industry. Without their contribution, there wouldn't be many leader company in the world especially in IT industry. THEY DO TAKE JOB POSITIONS, BUT THEIR CONTRIBUTION ALSO MAKES THE BUSINESS GROWTH AND MAY RESULT MORE JOB OPENINGS.\n\nAs the conclusion, the regulation is not likely to have an negative impact on both the citizens and the US economy. And not having such regulation will potentially cause US to lose its leadership on some STEM related industries.

Enabling continued extended OPT for qualifying students with experience in STEM fields is consistent with DHS's Study in the States initiative, announced after the 2008 IFR in September 2011 to encourage international students to study in the United States. That initiative particularly focused on enhancing our nation's economic, scientific and technological competitiveness by finding new ways to encourage talented international students to become involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. The initiative has taken various steps to enhance and improve the Nation's nonimmigrant student programs.\n\nCountries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. For example, Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent.  In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022. \n\nInternational students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy. Foreign students, for example, regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students.\n\nDHS continues to believe that the E-Verify program is an important measure to ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. The E-Verify program is an Internet-based service operated by USCIS, in partnership with the Social Security Administration (SSA). E-Verify is currently free to employers and is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. E-Verify electronically compares information contained on the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 (herein Form I-9) with records contained in government databases to help employers verify the identity and employment eligibility of newly-hired employees. This program currently is the best means available for employers to determine employment eligibility of new hires and, in some cases, existing employees. Before an employer can participate in the E-Verify program, the employer must enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHS and SSA. This memorandum requires employers to agree to abide by current legal hiring procedures and to follow required procedures in the E-Verify process to ensure that E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. Violation of the terms of this agreement by the employer is grounds for immediate termination of its participation in the program. \n\nI strongly support this new OPT extension rule. \n\nThank you\n\nHaikun Liu", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Haikun Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10928", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the new OPT extension.

Purpose of the Regulatory Action\n\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months, which is nobody's definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students.\n\nThe Regulations fail to protect U.S. workers because the Regulations fail to gage the wages of U.S. workers. Instead, the Regulations help ONLY the imported foreign students in gauging compliance, employers would be required to provide DHS with student compensation information, which would better situate the agency to monitor whether STEM OPT students are being compensated fairly.\n\nIf the DHS cared to protect the U.S. worker, then, the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or an adverse employment action against any U.S. EMPLOYEE. That would protect the U.S. worker.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael Harris", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3405", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think it is a brilliant idea to extent OPT for 24 months and here are the seasons:\n\n1: With this extension, it gives  America more time to benefit from those talent students and explore their potential; As we all know that people with expertise is the one who lead the development of a country in 21th century.

I understand there do exist the need of controlling immigration, but surely this rule is critical to this nation as well as its people.\n\nUnited States as the greatest country on earth, have been at the top on this planet for over a century. The power of Uncle Sam comes not only from the glory as the winner of World War, but also comes from its domination in economics, culture, science and technology. Science and technology is a key factor for this domination. One simple fact can describe the advantage in technology: Introduced 30 years ago, F-22 Raptor is still the most advanced aircraft in operation nowadays.\n\nThe science and technology development in this country contribute to the strongest army, biggest economy and most desirable living environment in this world, attracting large number of foreign students here. Thanks to the good education this country is providing, a lot foreign students finish their study and become qualified scientist or technicians hired by companies across the world. Now here is the question, should these young scientist and technicians be expelled from the country after they finished the first period of OPT, or offered a chance of extension? \n\nJust take a simple look at the industry and universities we can find how previous foreign students are contributing to USA's leading position in this world. So many non US born specialists are working for this country. A large percentage of them got their first employment as a OPT student. Of course they can switch to other visa status, such as H-1B. But the immigration pressure in this country is so huge that every year only limited number of H-1B visas are provided. It is the OPT extension that keeps them here and satisfying the employers' need. The STEM students are here to help, helping to keep the prosperity of this country. The industry will face severe problems if they cannot find enough qualified employee.\n\nThe number of immigrants do need to be controlled, but there are far more ways of control other than cancelling the OPT extension. One example would be the control of illegal immigrants.

Finally there will be more and more opportunities which everyone can benefit from this. It can also decrease the unemployment rate.

I would like to give an example to \ndemonstrate that not only this idea is terribly wrong, but\nalso the idea itself is bad for US.\n\nLet me start with a brief introduction of what RF and microwave engineers do.\nRF and microwave engineers are professionals who really understand\nthe behaviors of electromagnetic waves from a few MHz to hundreds of GHz. \nA tremendous amount of electronic devices, whether it be radars that used in the military, wireless communications (mobile phone, WiFi, etc.), satellite positioning and navigation, and MRI machines for medical imaging, all work in that frequency range. RF and microwave engineers use their knowledge and skills to design, \ntest and maintain these devices, make sure they work well so that\nsoldiers can protect the country, doctors can save the lives and\npeople can talk to their families, watch videos and play games.\n\nSo the question is: are there enough RF and microwave engineers who\nare qualified for this position and also being a citizen? The answer is no.\nRF and microwave companies in the united states can be classified into\n2 major categories: defense contractors and commercial companies. \nThe defense contractors only hire US citizens due to government \nregulations. Now for the commercial companies, for example my company, \nthe fact is: we have received very few applications of RF and microwave \nengineers from US citizens, and among them, mostly BS degree with little \nRF experience. My friend who designs antennas in a Connecticut company \nalso complains about lacking of qualified RF engineers with citizenship.\n\nHow can my company(with about 300 employees and mostly US citizens) \nsurvive in the global competition and make good products and services \nto our customers if we have to hire 5 RF engineers from only 3 applicants\nwith US citizenship? If we lose and get shut down, who's gonna take care\nof all these unemployed US citizens? Simple math here.\n\nNow on one hand there are not enough good engineers for the ever increasing demand from the defense and the industry, while on the other hand, \nhundreds of thousands of talented, hard-working Chinese students come to US\neach year, studying in the world-class universities, receiving the best engineering training, getting a MS or PhD degree, and then instead of dedicating their knowledge and skills to US companies US economy US society, they go back to China because of the immigration status. And then the government complains about China catching up on advanced technologies and being a huge threat. \n\nThe United States simply cannot afford to such ridiculous fact resulted from the poorly designed immigration policies. The government has to make reasonable decisions to keep US the best, the most advanced and most powerful country in the world. \nIf you have the same wish and vision as me, please support the OPT extension\nand call for a change.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhao Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15056", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:\n\n1.

US government and education institutes have spent billions of money in educating these students to be specialists in those areas. However, the majority of students holding the STEM degree are immigrants or international students. If the US government do not try to build a relaxed economic and immigrant environment, more and more students who are specialized in these areas will return to their home countries or the countries where have better immigrant policy. Due to the gap of economic and living environment between US and the other developing/developed countries becomes closer and closer, the good immigrant policy will be the key elements that US can keep these valuable intelligent. The previous immigrant policy needs to be updated. The pressure coming from the H1B lottery has kept many brilliant people away from the US job market and even the choice of coming to study in the US. The cheating created by the Indian ICC is also very unfair to some Indian people and all other immigrants from other countries. The existence of ICC is also caused by the H1B lottery. Overall, the old H1B policy needs to be refined and try to be fair to the people who have relatively competitive reason to stay in US. This new OPT policy cannot only release the pressure of the H1B lottery, moreover, it can decrease the cheating cases filed by the ICC. This is the reason that I strongly support the OPT extension.

I strongly agree to the extension. Many people oppose the extension with the argument that international students can \"rob\" US citizens' jobs due to this extension. The opinion is too ridiculous and so short vision.\n\nIn the free market, company hires employees because their skills that can make contributions to the company, not because what nationalities they have. US job market has critical shortage of STEM professionals, which is the reason for OPT extension for STEM majors since 2008. Without the extension, many STEM professionals need to go back to their national countries and devote their knowledge and creation to other countries. US universities spend so many years to train them, but they cannot contribute any to US just because their OPT are too short to find opportunities. For the US companies, they are facing problems to find a match person. Even if there is no foreigner in the job market, does it mean companies must high someone without the desired skills but only holding a US citizenship? I don't think it is wise. Companies will gradually lose creation if they cannot find matched and talented people, then lose competitive. What's next, they will be beaten by other international companies in the global market. Finally, many US lose jobs not limited in the STEM field!  The key problem in the STEM jobs is not the nationality but the STEM talent and skill. If we just want to save couple jobs to reject talents, the long term result is losing more jobs!\n\nThe foreigners cannot \"rob\" jobs from US citizens who has the STEM skills, but the talented foreigners can help to create jobs for US citizens in more general fields. Even with the 24 month extension, I don't worry about those talented US STEM students to find a job. As long as they have desired skills, company highly prefer them than foreigners, because of fluent communications and no visa problems. The current situation is the big shortage of US STEM students. The 24 month extension helps company to find the match person, and design more creative products, increase the competition of the company. The growing company create more job in sales, finance, marketing etc.  The technology driven development contribute a healthy economy and continually creating jobs.\nThe extension brings a win-win results for US citizens and international students.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kara  Chu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14094", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please expand OPT for STERM students.

International students pay high tuition and fees, bear high living expenses (compared to the countries they come from), and contribute to the economy by paying indirect and direct taxes. The degrees without professional experience won't add any value if they go back to their own country. Also, if the government puts a ban on students' working, the rate of students coming for higher studies would drop significantly affecting the companies and economy.

I graduated from University of California, Merced(UCM) and currently utilizing the 12 Month Post completion OPT to train and work in the field of my Major.

I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. I am glad that me and my international colleagues are able to gain practical training experience in the US because certain specialized majors are not yet completely developed in other parts of the world like my own major 'Quantitative and systems Biology', part of Cellular and Molecular Biology which amalgamates various biological, physical and mathematical principles to better understand Biology. It is a relatively new field in the United states itself but I get to learn and experience how the field of Data science is shaping in real time through the principles of Mathematical Biology, through my OPT and STEM OPT Extension. Without the OPT and STEM OPT many international students will like me will be limited to just theoretical knowledge but not the practical experience we crave.\n\nI am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.\n \nI appreciate the longer unemployment period introduced in the current draft as finding a job in specialized fields is quite time consuming and it also gives a chance to change companies for a wider experience.

I fail to see the logic.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\n    OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n    OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n\nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\n    The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by David Juszczyk", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3264", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "IMHO, this plan has far more positive impact than negative ones. \n\n1. The new policy will attract more talented international students to US colleges and universities. A lot of employers in foreign countries value the professional training experience more than the college life in US. The 3-years new OPT policy will attract more STEM students to attend US colleges and universities as the favorable professional training experiences compared to other European counties. Considering international students normally pay their own tuitions, this new policy can be a significant boost to the higher education industry in US, which provides more employments from local people. \n\n2. To maintain the leadership position in technology and innovation, US needs more talents from diversified cultures and backgrounds. Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, google CEO, Sundar Pichai are great examples that how people from a different culture have advanced the technologies and created tons of jobs for US citizens. \n\n3. International students can also be great resources for local companies to expand global exposure. The new OPT program will allow students to build up network and credibility in the company. With a better understanding of the local market in foreign countries and language advantage, they can become a task force for US local companies to expand in a global market. For example, Uber China and India expansion teams are all led by people who started their careers through OPT programs. Now they became the leaders in Uber and help a US based company to expand in India and China markets, which in turn benefits US economy. \n\nThese are just few key points came up in my mind.

The nation have been taking advantage of what comes from the world, without fears of facing the challenge from those place, and that can only be achieved by great nations.\n\nInternational students have been winning their places because they have proved that they are better than their competitors, better in making contribution to the nation. I believe many of us have received the code of conduct training from the employers, which includes working with diversity. It is because that the people who lead the industry know that diversity brings creativity, thus leading to innovation. Without that kind of diversity, the companies cannot know what the world needs, which in turns harms not only the growth of their services and income, but also what the nations can give to everyone involved in the society.\n\nAs for the education, many schools in the US now accept international students, which also brings different cultures in to the classes. Native American students can benefit from this because they can broaden their views by communicating and cooperating with international students, which is helpful for their future, worldwide careers. The best way to get to know different cultures is to get to know people who come from there, and that helps all the students, native and international, to take a view of the world from more perspetives.\n\nAfter all, having the citizenship or not, the key point is to work hard for the nation, to prove that what we do for the country can match what the country gives us.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dongyun Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16917", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Competition makes the United States a better country.

It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.  The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.

Options to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\n\n\n2. The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\n\nSincerely,\nHS", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by H Siu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17928", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support opt as it allows student to get good exposure and companies to get better employee.

Nowadays, a lot of the research opportunities and projects in STEM field take longer than 12 months to complete, given the complexity and duration of typical research and engineering related activities. If I am planning to perform postdoctoral research or enrich my industrial experience upon completion of my PhD, I would definitely have higher chance of being accepted with a longer extension of my OPT.

Academic institutions and industrial companies can keep these talented students without having to worry about sponsoring their work visas and the complicated paperwork that comes with it.

With more foreign students, the local young people will have to compete with these foreign students rather than addict themselves in substance abuse or parties. As we all know, competition contributes to prosperity. A strong United States is based on the fusion of different races and cultures. We hope to see a strong United States is famous for its comprehensive and open. Small minds on narrowing down the training opportunities will harm the benefits of the corporations and the students.

This expanding helps American companies find suitable candidates with engineer background for their global business and provides a chance for excellent students to know about how the company works in different areas and then help them to play a more important role either in technology or in business for their companies. This method not only saves companies' time to find the right person but also saves their money. This is because the students who works around two years in the states can get a better understanding about their working while with only one year OPT. It is very hard for them to have a deep and overall understanding about the technology their working on. And after these two years, students could become an expert in certain technology area and could be a leader back to their country for their companies'  other technical center. These students with great technology background know well about their country and their culture. This advantage helps their company to expand their business globally and effectively. It is highly possible that the company gain some advantages because of the high efficiency. Meanwhile it is an excellent chance for students' personal development. They can gain the special working experience of working in difference area and apply the good skills they learned in one area into another.\n\nSecond, This is an information exchange between university and industry. The reason why students can to States is because they have strong desire to know better, to dig deeper in their major and to be top in their area. With this passion, they become excellent in their studying area. OPT gives these students a chance to know how industry operates and find a way to combine their theoretical study with practical industry. While the company can have fresh student bring in the latest research topic and idea which may be very important for the companies' future development.

Actually, students can only learn basic knowledge in class, especially for the ones with STEM degree. Students learn basic science concepts, equations, models etc in the class, and they need to go to industry to realize them. If there is no extension of the OPT period, students with F1 visa have to leave this country in 12 months, which is not fair for them.\n\nSecond, extended OPT period will not hurt the U.S job market. Actually, it benefits the job market a lot. It gives the employers more choices. On the other hand, this also stimulate the native students to improve themselves due to the competition from the international students.\n\nThird, for this country, it is also good. International students always have to spend a lot of money, which actually create a lot of jobs for people. For example, restaurants, grocery stores, apartments, even airlines. I can not image that if all students have to leave in 12 months, how many students want to come here? They spend a lot of money and time, trying to improve themselves in this country. However, they have to leave without enough time to find a job. Then why not just stay in their own country?

It keeps America as a front runner in many aspects.  To keep this momentum, America needs great talented personnel in STEM field. \n\nIndividuals with outstanding talent from all over the world comes to America to be part of this great development and make an impact in this world. Universities and research institutions nurtures this talent and grooms them. They help students to gain immense knowledge in their field. The hope here is that one great scientist or a doctor or an engineer can create a big domain which can create thousands of jobs for all. \n\nForeign students who really want to contribute to this country and community need to follow various immigration rules. Often, it's extremely hard to get work visa before their student visa expires. This is due to limited number of visas.  STEM personnel who couldn't get a work visa usually goes to their home country which is good for their home country. These personnel would start working for companies of foreign countries which would pose immense competition to American companies  across the globe. This is hampering growth of U.S companies resulting in less job growth here. \n\nSTEM OPT extension is a stop gap arrangement for few months and it's not a permanent visa.

I submit 3 examples of how such abuse of power has occurred;\n\nExample 1) The US Constitution, as a contract between the People of the United States, the several States of this Union and the Government of the Federation, was the device by which the Principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence were institutionalized into a Government that derivers its power from the consent of the Governed. In summary, the primary job (duty) of the Federal Government IS to protect the Sovereignty of the United States.\n\nThe Federal Government has steadily eroded this duty - that includes the protection of the rights of ALL Citizens of the United States, EQUALLY - by intruding into the authority reserved to the several States of this Union, respectively, and to the People. Instead of protecting our rights by protecting our National Sovereignty, the Federal government has taken on the duty of deciding what is good for the Citizens of the United States as a centralized Collective (one size fits all).\n\nExample 2) Social Security was sold to Congress and the American people with the promise by Franklin Roosevelt that only those paid into the system would collect from the system. But the Federal government has worked tirelessly, not only to break that promise but to erase its memory entirely. Social Security has become yet another tool of Socialism to steal the wealth of the individual and distribute it to the community!! \n\nExample 3) The numerous Immigration Laws passed by Congress meant to protect our citizens and yet offer opportunity to those who wish to become American citizens and embrace our First Principles of Life, Liberty and Property as stated in the Declaration of  Independence (please consider the original draft of the D of I concerning Property) - EQUALLY - are now being ignored and outright VIOLATED by the Federal government. The only purpose of this violation is to degrade our sovereignty and \"equalize\" the United States to the rest of the world as a \"3rd world\" member state of a World Government.\n\nIt is not surprising then that the Bureaucracy and, specifically to this issue, the DHS, is attempting to expand the original intent of the OPT program to encourage the \"Immivasion\" of  foreign labor in preference to Citizens of the United States. The Administrative Bureaucracy, which has NO Constitutional basis whatsoever (according to the original Constitution and the Intent of the Original Constitution and the 9th and 10th Amendments to the Constitution) is now making policies, laws, and administering taxes in the form of penalties and fees - WITHOUT representation and without legal Authority from the Supreme Law of the Land! The Federal Government thru its Department of Homeland Security now Routinely breaks its promise to its Citizens by providing distinct advantages to foreigners workers to steal from our citizens jobs they are immanently qualified for and have been actively seeking. The OPT program specifically violates the trust of the Citizens of the United States by;\n\nDenying American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 in favor of foreign labor.\n\nThe OPT program STEALS from the Citizens of the United States by;   \n\nRemoving $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. \n        \nThe expansion of the OPT program contains not a single reversal of either of these two violations but rather EXPANDS the likelihood of even more violations.\n\nI am summarily opposed to the very existence of the Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans, let alone any expansion of its authority and practices!!!\n\nThank You\n\nDerrell Poole\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Derrell Poole", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4419", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "See attached file(s)", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kamran Abbas", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19722", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!

First, I heard that there are some ridiculous negative arguments against the new rule like, \"The STEM students are stealing jobs from US citizens, and citizenship means less and less in this country\". The person who drew those conclusions has not read through the new rule at all. The STEM students with OPT extension will only be eligible to work under their own corresponding major like Science, Technology, Engineer and Math, not some other jobs with low education requirements. Also, they could only work for the e-Verify companies, which have to pass the strict check by US government for their eligibility of hiring foreigners. Moreover, it is pretty easy to find out how eager the US high technology companies need well-educated employees to serve their cutting-edge business. Our smartphones, internet, macs and laptops need a lot of high tech students to work on that and maintain US domination position in those areas. However, US native high tech students are not enough to satisfy the increasing requirement of those companies, so that is why international students are employed to fill in the gap. What is even more ridiculous and unreasonable, some one said \"the employment of international OPT students make the job hunting and business even harder for US students by introducing more competition.\" To argue with this opinion, I have to point out some \"open secret\" that is well known in high tech industry. When a position with lowest education requirement of undergraduate or better is posted by a high-tech company, employers or hiring managers tend to search the qualified US citizens first with Master or PhD degrees, and then the undergraduate citizens. But most of time, they could not find any strong candidates with good background and experience, so then they start to search candidates from the international students with PhD or post-Doc graduated from top universities. I am working for a semiconductor company now, and I have a bunch of US colleagues with master degrees and more international colleagues with PhD. So STEM students WILL NEVER steal any jobs from US students since the industry is following this \"open secret\" now, and QUALIFIED US students will always get the highest priority of finding jobs.\n\nIn addition, American colleges and graduate schools are so competitive in attracting excellent students by offering the OPT opportunities, which makes other Study-Abroad market like Europe, Australia and New Zealand very jealous. US universities are earning millions of dollars by enrolling international students even in the worst financial crisis time like 2008. Without OPT rules, I believe more students would choose other countries instead of US in the future. More important, many cities' tax income depends on universities. Without the expense from international students, landlords in towns that depend on university business only would feel challenging to find a reliable tenant; restaurants would have to close because of fewer guests; educational institute would suffer from a tough time of enrolling fewer and fewer students.\n\nAt last, excellent people will always find their positions wherever they are. Instead of driving students back to their own countries, US government should do their best to keep those valuable human resource staying in US, serving US companies and paying US Federal and State tax even though they do not have US citizenship. If it still sounds difficult to understand the danger of denying this OPT extension rules, just look at the well-known smartphones market and see how Non-US high companies are doing in order to compete with US companies. Is it still the fact that all of us are using electronic stuffs MADE in US?", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Will Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19461", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Actually the extension of STEM OPT promotes US economic conditon and make it stronger.

Specifically, the proposal would allow such F-1 STEM students who have elected to pursue 12 months of OPT in the United States to extend the OPT period by 24 months (STEM OPT extension). This 24-month extension would effectively replace the 17-month STEM OPT extension currently available to certain STEM students. The rule also improves and increases oversight over STEM OPT extensions by, among other things, requiring the implementation of formal mentoring and training plans by employers, adding wage and other protections for STEM OPT students and U.S. workers, and allowing extensions only to students with degrees from accredited schools.\nAs with the current 17-month STEM OPT extension, the proposed rule would authorize STEM OPT extensions only for students employed by employers enrolled in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS') E-Verify employment eligibility verification program. The proposal also includes the Cap-Gap relief first introduced in 2008 for any F-1 student with a timely filed H-1B petition and request for change of status. This Cap-Gap relief allows such students to automatically extend the duration of F-1 status and any current employment authorization until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested.\nIn addition to improving the integrity and value of the STEM OPT program, this proposed rule also responds to a court decision that vacated a 2008 DHS regulation on procedural grounds. The proposed rule includes changes to the policies announced in the 2008 rule to further enhance the academic benefit provided by STEM OPT extensions and increase oversight, which will better ensure that students gain valuable practical STEM experience that supplements knowledge gained through their academic studies, while preventing adverse effects to U.S. workers. By earning a functional understanding of how to apply their academic knowledge in a work setting, students will be better positioned to begin careers in their fields of study. These on-the-job educational experiences would be obtained only with those employers that commit to developing students' knowledge and skills through practical application. The proposed changes would also help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Magdeline Primrose", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4092", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree with the extension of OPT, because it helps people to realize their dream , and eventually make  the USA turn into the ultimate biggest winner.\n\nOPT is the key factor differentiating US from other destination countries for international students.

Compared to other countries, the OPT and the OPT-EXT in US are the so brilliant that US always attracts much more students than other countries. AND for the reason that most International students pay out-state tuition, the universities in US benefited a lot from these students. If no OPT or OPT-EXT available, there would be a huge drop in the numbers of students studying in US, hence those universities that have a large group of international students would suffer. Some staffs in the international Students Affairs in the universities would be laid-off, since universities no longer need so many staffs with fewer international students. When there were fewer students, there were fewer consumers and as a result fewer jobs for American citizens. Jobs market in CA, MA, TX, WA and many other states that hold lots of international students would shrink because of the number of those student decreased. As a consequence, not only the international students need the OPT-EXT, but the states and citizens would also love this proposal which recovers the economy and creates jobs.\n2.\tGovernment should give the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities the opportunity to stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. economy. As most students who are eligible for OPT-EXT are capable of receiving a relatively high income, they would also pay a lot for their stay in US, thus contributes to the US economy. They also pay tax, which keep both the states government and the federal government operating and finally still the American citizens benefit from these students who are using the OPT-EXT. \n3.\tDiversity is very important for America. A great many of outstanding celebrities were once international students. For instance, Jerry Yang, the founder of Yahoo! was born in Taiwan. He finished his degree in Stanford University while designing the prototype for Yahoo! which was the most popular searching engine in the world. Yahoo! changed the Internet and still occupies some of the market in searching engine till now. How internet in America would become if Jerry Yang were not even able to work in America? Would America still lead the development of Internet? Or would Japan took the leading position? History taught us lessons. Without OPT-EXT, is it still one hundred percent for sure that the next Yahoo! still born in America?\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhiyi Huang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17480", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Its really great to all immigrant students its give good time to prove our self and will be helpful to our america...thank you obama...", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Suresh Goud Ediga", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10377", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you people can't protect America first I suggest you run for office in an other country !!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joseph Mcginnis", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6801", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support OPT STEM extension.

The income of universities/colleges (especially the private ones) keeps decreasing because of the falling number of foreign students who usually pay higher tuition compared with the native/local students.

As we all agree, the economic growth in the 21st century is largely driven by the development of new technologies, especially in the STEM fields, allowing skilled STEM students, who have already obtained degrees from renowned US universities, to emerge in the US workforce provides an unparalleled benefit to the growth of small technological business in US, given the current shortage of available STEM professionals in the domestic market.\n\nSecondly, all eligible STEM students have already studied and properly trained at US universities. It just seems like a waste of time and money to send these valuable intellectual resources back to their home countries right after the graduation, without allowing them to contribute back to the United States when they would if they worked in US for a limited period of time.\n\nThird, the United States has always been an immigrant country and the welcoming immigration regulations have guaranteed to attract the most talented people to come make this country better and stronger.

It mainly benefit international student , because students have come across to USA leaving their country by investing huge amount of money to learn some quality and hands on experience in the field of related technology. 24 months of initial course of experience gives them training and required necessary knowledge they have acquired in their respective degrees in the US universities. I would also recommend to improve this training period more than 24 months if possible because to it will be a very short period to assume student will gain all the necessary hands on training in such a vast field of technology where skills set grows and changes every day.\n     2. This rule if implemented ,also hugely benefits US government and its economy ,because every international student will choose to come to USA only leaving other countries in the world like UK,Germany,Australia where there is a similar opportunity growing in engineering field. Each international student will pay tuition fees of minimum $40K dollars excluding living expenses. Every term minimum of 300 -400 students join each university. If we calculate the total income all the US universities gain per year form only international students ,will make huge impact on US economy. This will in-turn benefit all the citizen of the country.\n   3. This rule if implemented will not take away any kind of job opportunities from local americans because, the stated proposed rule has made very clear that, employers should give equal opportunity in considering native americans for the jobs as well and also healthy competition always increases growing potential of individual, which will improve intellectual standard of local americans in competing with international students rather than sending them back from USA.\n      Large number of top employers are based in silicon valley of USA, because they get huge variety of intellectuals from across the world here. Technology is growing vastly which is creating employment demand for more and more such deserving students.

If students won't have opt extension in the future, it will be the loss of US and even the world.\n\nSecondly, if opt extension is canceled, there will be a huge impact on american economy.

The income of many famous universities in the US will also decrease, which I think is a very bad thing especially under the economic circumstances now.\n\nThirdly, someone complains that they don't have job opportunities because of international students. However, most international students work in Technology companies, HRs in those companies could't find enough US citizens at all.

For my personal opinion, I think this proposal will have a great impact for the following area:\n\nIn the country level, every year there will be thousands of STEM students come to US to pursue their bachelor/master/PhD degree. They choose US as their stop just because the STEM education is around the best in the world? Not really, another big reason is that they have the opportunity to work in the world best technical/finance companies or research related laboratories after graduation. They could contribute their knowledge and skill to the companies and improve the progress of human society and science and technology. And if this proposal is revoked, the country will lose tons of talented young people. As far as I know, most of the STEM students in US are the top students in their own countries, while rest of them are coming from rich families and just want to experience a different life in different country. So definitely, the government should think about a way to hold these talented young people and let these people to stay longer in the country to make the United States more powerful and still in the leading position of technology, finance, research fields. \n\nBesides, in terms of education perspective, by revoking the opt extension. The US university will be less attractive to international students since they have less opportunity to work in US after graduation. Instead of spending a lot of money to study at US and then they have no choices but only to go back to their homeland after graduation, why not they study at their homelands to establish their social network at earlier or study at other countries which will provide potential working opportunity. Definitely, international students will feel it is worthless to spend much of money to study at US and then go back. What's more, most universities in US are opening more programs to welcome the international students. And these programs usually require expensive tuition. In one aspect, it provides more openings positions for teachers, lecturers. While in another perspective, the schools could have more funding (which is obtained by students' tuition) that can be applied to research, or improve the facilities. And similarly, for other industrial, these international students would also have a great impact on and they could promote the development of tourism, catering, commerce, etc. industry and these are a great incentive to the national economy.  So it is a completely bad idea to revoke the OPT extension. \n\nLast but not least,  right now the concerns for this proposal is that some US natives think that foreigners take too much working opportunity from their hands. However, the fact is that the STEM students only take a tiny ratio verse the population of the whole country (thousands vs 300 million). Also, as a software development engineer in Amazon. I think generally in technical industry, the hiring bar for a native is lower than an international student. So for those natives who could not get a job, I think they should really check about themselves, whether they own enough knowledge, skills to take for a job instead just complain about the policy. No one in the world could get a job without spending effort and no one is born with a job just because s/he is  a native. As a country with diversity, I think United States should encourage more young talented people to study, work and live in the country instead of evicting them off.

During the two years at boston university, i met  a lot of the best professors around the world and learned a lot not only in material science but also other fields like biomedical engineering and computer engineering,etc. It was just such diversities in my school make me more competitive and integrated than students graduated from other universities. OPT extension is the best opportunities to attract lots of the young talent all over the world to united states which greatly diversified american society and STEM field. It just because such diversity make entire science and engineering in US more innovative more creative than any other countries around the world. If US losing this OPT extension program, it will be detrimental to STEM field and entire american economy. \n\nI am working at saint gobain R&D department a french forbes 500 company at Massachusetts. At R&D center northborough, we have almost 20-30% of new hires using this OPT and OPT extension every year. Each year, they are contributing almost 40-50% of the new US patent to our company. In my company, 20-30% of people coming from france or other european countries and about 20% of people coming from Asia, like china, india etc which makes saint gobain a very international company. people coming from different country bring their own culture, way of thinking and languages that truly make us more competitive because this will help the company to learn better their customer from their employees.

Rejecting students in these fields would undoubtedly cause elite decline, which is really an catastrophe for the companies and universities. Third, as the economy develops, many country struggles to attract more talents to build the country's prosperity. For example, many universities in China are having special plans for oversea graduate students, including high salary, good research platforms and housing condition,etc. There is growing number of students who would like to go back to their own coun tries.

Knowledge, as it is, is like a seed but for the seed to grow, bloom, and finally to become the tallest tree it needs the right environment, needs constant nurturing and on the top of everything it needs to adapt. Universities and colleges here do an outstanding job sowing the seed but unless the seed sees the light of the day it has no opportunity to grow, it has no opportunity to show to this world what it can really do. The sunlight, I am talking about here is the industry exposure that a student needs to make the best use of his potential and to show that he too can make this world a better place to live. \nHence I fully support the better chance an International student gets with the new 24 month OPT extension. Thank you America and Thank you Department of Homeland Security for  everything you did and everything you are going to do.

It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. This spirit is what makes America so attractive\n\n2. This OPT program would attract more foreign students come to study in the U.S. universities, which could solve those financial problems in universities. If this OPT program won't pass, many students would not consider to study in U.S. universities. This would lead many public universities raise their tuition for local American students. Take University of California as an example, if there were not many international students, could the local American students afford their tuition? Think carefully about this, your kids would lose their chance to realize their American dreams if they could not afford expansive school tuition!\n\n3. More talented foreign people work in the U.S. companies are actually helping the U.S. economy growth. The current unemployment rate in the U.S. is low, but the economic growth is still low as well. With more genius working for the U.S., companies, especially those IT companies, would gain more profits.\n\n4. Many foreign students do not want to stay and work in the U.S. permanently after they graduate from college. Most of them just want two or three years work experience in the U.S. so that they could find a nice job back in their own countries. Passing this OPT program would give those foreign students a good chance to get work experience, but it doesn't mean all of those students would use this opportunity to stay in the U.S. forever.\n\n5. To be fair, the passing rate for getting the H-1 visa is and will ,no matter what, controlled by the U.S. government completely. Passing this OPT doesn't necessarily mean those students would have a higher chance to get H-1 visa. This program is mainly used to reduce the cost for companies.

This is definitely a great rule and will benefit a lot!\n\n First, it is good for students, as they can apply what they learned to make contribution and convert knowledge into real value or economy for a longer time. What can you do in 12 months? Well you need to get familiar with the company, with your team, with the job, with tools they use, etc. You don't learn much and know much within this time and have to go back after. How will that be in an additional 24 months? You already know your stuff and is making contributions and gaining experience every day in this extension time! Also they will get deeper understanding on how Americans run their companies, create their new startups, and make great international businesses. These are potentially different ideas from what they know in their own country, and will help them manage their work life better in the future.\n\n Second, it is good for the society and the nation. Current OPT rule only allows foreign students to work for 12 months. What does US benefit from this? Companies have to recruit every year for new students and bring them on board, then send them away? But working for additional 24 months, on the other hand, create much value to the society and the nation. Think about how many foreign students are eager to learn latest technology from this country and how these elites can make a huge difference when they are working here for 3 years! They will help a lot for developing new technology, creating new innovative products, and bring new stuff to the whole society. How many foreign students does Google, Facebook and Apple have? And how are they rocking people's life every year?\n\n Last but not least, it is good for the business relationship between US and other countries. When these students go back to their country after OPT and extension, they will take all things they know about American business back. They will then become the bridge between businesses in US and other nations, improving international understanding and cooperation, help the growth of global economy. America will see more good stuff coming in, and sell more to others to make money (How would Uber go abroad easily without native hands in those nations? Could Apple use the same strategy from US in these other countries?). They will also spread American's good way in thinking, innovating and managing to apply in their own area.\n\n There are still other benefits that can be achieved with this extension rule, yet I already wrote a lot. As President Obama said once, America should not just educate these foreign students and simply send them back. This rule is a perfect chance for these elites to make difference and make contribution, just for this nation!\n\nThank you very much!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chenguang Liu, Citrix Systems, Inc.", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2010", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As Americans our forefathers worked to make laws and follow the laws to make this country better.

Many of them are not planning to stay in the US, leaving an even smaller number of potential hires for research institutions and businesses. The STEM program was created so that the US could maintain its global leadership of technical advances. In an extended period of time, the program allows us to utilize the high-skilled workers in whom we have invested many educational resources. At the end of the program, the workers will leave the country unless they successfully win the lottery to an H1B work visa.\n\nThe STEM extension program benefits the US economy in many ways. There is an extremely high demand for STEM workers right now in the US. Companies are finding it so difficult to recruit researchers and engineers that it does not make sense to cut them off of a group of their employees after 12 months. Hiring international students is not cost effective - the companies will still lose most of these people at some point due to visa issues. If they want to keep the workers by submitting an H1B work visa application, they will have to pay high fees and lawyers and still face a low success rate of less than 30 percent. Nonetheless, companies are still recruiting international students because they really need high-skilled STEM workers.\n\nStopping the STEM extension program hurts businesses, especially small businesses in fast-growing technical fields, such as medicine, engineering, and software development. First of all, it will cost a lot of time and money for small businesses to search for new workers to replace existing workers on OPT work permissions, especially if they have originally planned for their workers to apply for STEM extensions. It would be even harder than it is now for small companies to compete with large corporations to hire competent workers if the pool of potential hires shrinks, as more than 50,000 STEM students near the end of their OPT work permission leave the country. Without the program, many STEM students will choose to leave the country right after finishing their degree, just as most non-STEM students do. This will worsen the hiring situation for many small businesses.\n\nThe STEM extension program alleviates the shortage of STEM workers in the US without harming the chances for employment of US citizens and permanent residents. Please seriously consider keeping and improving the program for the many research institutions and businesses affected.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa Polsby", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19206", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This proposal should be highly supported due to following reasons.\n\n1. US attracts foreign higher education pursuers to come not only just because of supreme research resources, world-class institutions and marketable environment, but also due to the reasonable regulations that allow those students, scholars and academic organizations to stay and strengthen their competency and training via industry, especially in emerging STEM fields. There are a number of other countries that do have one of the best educational resources and fame for advanced technology including UK, Australia and Japan, yet they, to a large extent, purely enforce the endurance of education within campus and institutions without giving adequate space for scholars to practice in local real-world industry - this is the main reason why most people nowadays are not willing to go to those countries to seek better educational opportunities. International students and scholars contribute unignorable amount of funding to US universities, educational organizations and institutes every year. If OPT STEM is further weakened, I could foresee a dramatic decrease of students and scholars to come to US for higher education in the future, inevitably leading to a huge loss in such areas and negatively impacting US educational systems.\n\n2. Many post-graduated students and scholars are now holding OPT STEM visa working as core members for some best engineering and technology companies (like, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Merck, etc.) in US. Abolishing OPT STEM will immediately nullify such workforce in these companies, resulting in a blank period giving rise to unimaginable loss in some of the most important realms supporting US economy and research today, which we can hardly afford. This blank period cannot be reinstalled with US citizen workforce immediately and without compromising the market and those companies' interests.\n\n3. Another point I would like to bring up is, there is rarely a way that OPT STEM will truly take away jobs from US workers. Because companies willing to support work Visa in order for foreigners to work are not the majority. Opposites might only see the fact that many big IT companies are more than prepared to bolster foreigners' work Visa. Nevertheless, most medium and small companies and start-ups which are the major units in the market, with obviously less employee size and premature internal structure, usually reject to hire foreign workforce without US citizenship, because the company will need to pay a lot more to hire and train the foreign employee, prepare, apply, and maintain a foreigner's Visa status, than directly getting a local citizen available to work. Moreover, only the most talented foreign workforce can eventually get into those top companies, whereas most are competing against local citizens merely in small-to-medium-company market, in which case citizens or US workers still gain a dominant advantage.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhishen Wen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11459", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's definitely necessary to expanding training opportunities for F1 no immigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all Eligible F1 students.

He has seen more and more jobs off-shored to India.  He is currently working for a company that is in disarray--its stock prices have dropped by 40%--because so many projects are being done by workers in India who have poor technical ability and an even poorer understanding of concepts like taking responsibility for your own work performance, meeting deadlines, and so on.  American business culture does not magically bloom overnight in exotic locales.  Cheap foreign labor is no bargain if the workers can't or won't do the job.  And when those same workers come to the USA, they bring their sub-par skills and lackadaisical work ethic with them.\n\nUnlike Americans, Indians have no problem with showing loyalty to \"their own kind.\"  When Indian workers are hired into an American tech firm, they take every opportunity to bring in more Indian workers.  The result is that  hiring of Indians snowballs, with departments and companies becoming nearly all-Indian in composition.  Americans' naive multiculturalism is a form of suicide when pitted against the traditional in-group loyalty practiced by nearly every other population on Earth.\n\nThe USA is slipping from dominance in many areas where we used to crush the competition.  Let's not lose our pre-emminence in STEM.  Stop undermining American STEM workers.  They are the best in the world!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Diana Blackwell", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3661", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "That is really good for the future of America, and it's a good opportunity to provide more job for many IT elite.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zijian Liu, NJIT", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0398", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Good opportunities for the tech staff in US which is good for the US economy.

And they are all in their way to bring more stunning technologies to us. Those companies hire international students not because they have STEM extension, but their perfect performance after strict interview process. Without STEM extension, those companies will have less choice on who to hire and will definitely impact the overall product quality. \n\n2. STEM extension brings more job opportunity. Yes, STEM extension will not reduce the number of jobs available in the market, but on the contrary, increase it. For most students, the best job we can get is an entry level job. As there are more and more entry level employees, companies will need more higher level employees to manage them, more culinary staff, more logistic staff. Further, as the company grows, it will definitely influence the society, and mostly, positively. Which will increase whole profit in society and thus create more job opportunities. \n\n3. STEM Extension brings diversity. This could be the most apparent one. Without those international students, new employees could probably only be citizens or green card holders. Although America have a great diversity of human race and culture, she can't stop absorbing new stuff. As far as I know, international students are mostly China and Indian students, and most of them are here in U.S. for the first time. Unlike ABCs(America Borne Chinese), those Chinese student general don't speak English very well but knows original Chinese culture very well.

Most students benefit the US economy by paying a huge amount for housing, tuition, food, service, etc and leave the US after graduation. \n\nSome people might believe that OPT extension will allow companies to hire international students for a lower wage which leads to a decrease of benefit and job opportunity for US citizens. However, this is completely untrue. US companies are NOT allowed to hire an international student instead of a US citizen for a lower wage. As a matter of fact, it is much harder for an international STEM student to find a job than an American STEM student. International students have cultural and communications barriers which put them at a much lower hand during interviews. Furthermore, most companies prefer American students over international students because they do not want to go through the extremely complicated and unpredictable process of H1b application.

DHS argues that OPT and OPT-ext is one of the most important reasons as foreign students choose to come to States to get their degrees rather than going anywhere else. I totally agree with this point. I am a international student myself and I could have the option to go to England, but I still choose to come here simply because OPT and OPT extension make it possible for me to put what I learn into practice. This is not only true to me but also to almost all the international students I know of. I As far as I know, a great number of students back in my home country are already considering universities in other countries, like in Canada, Australia and New Zeland because of more friendly policy to international students there and a still unclear future of OPT policy here in the States. If this program is gone, no doubt it will be a disaster for American education system.\n\n2. Public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students. I argue that not only schools will benefit from international students but also local economy. I have great examples to support my claim. I am from University of Southern California, a great schoo with largest amount of international student in the States but in a very bad neighborhood. To make sure students can get back to their home safely during the night, USC is making every effort. Starting from last year, USC partnered with Uber to let the student call Uber services after 8 pm and USC is paying the bill for students. I talked to a lot of Uber drivers, they say ever since that, they can make up to 300 hundred dollars every night. They can expect a ride every two mins. Local economy benefits a lot from this because many well paid jobs are created. what is more, we can look at this example from another angle. The people who implement this Uber feature and make it all possible are very likely to be those employees on their OPT or H1B in Uber. This is a great example indicating lots of jobs can be created by these STEM students. Another example is about tourism, shopping, dining and all kinds of services. I live in Los Angeles for almost 4 years and witness a great positive influence international students can have on the local businesses. For example, dealership are particularly welcoming international students because they usually buy cars with full cash. Restaurents business are booming in city of Alhambra, Monterey Park, Korean town and San Gabrel because of huge influx of foreign students. Tens of thousands of local people are employed in all these businesses. So the take away is, students are also customers, they bring prosperity to local businesses and at the same time they are coming up with and implementing idea that can bring more jobs.\n\n3. I interned in Amazon during the summer and there are a lot of employees on OPT extensions or H1b visas. Their work have a huge impact on creating more jobs. For example, Amazon lockbox service, which allow buyers to pick up their purchases from a nearby Amazon lock box, is originally a project implemented by foreign stem students. Now this service is production and Amazon sets up a another chain of services to make it possible, for example, setting up warehouses and so on. This business involves hiring huge amount local people. And same thing is happening in Facebook, Linkedin, Apple, Microsoft and so on. The Amazon example I just mentioned is just tip of an iceburg.\n\n4. One statement made by DHS is 'US employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries'. I find this one very true. I have my own example to support this claim. When I interned at Amazon, I was assigned to a group whose core technology is about human language processing/ understanding. I remember we were doing a project involving my home market that requires not only computer science knowledge but also a decent understanding of my home language. And my knowledge and language skills did help a lot.\n\n5. A good policy bring more educated people into the counties and I simply can not see any harm it will do to this country. Foreign students also help to improve the safety of the community. Again taking USC as one example, USC locates at a very bad neighborhood. It is pretty close to south central in Los Angeles, which has a name for being the gang capital of the world. Couple years ago, the entire USC area was super dangerous and bad things happened to people during the nights, but lately due to the fact that USC taking a great number of international students. Local people started to rent their housing to students, and gradually the entire neighborhood is becoming a safer place. Same thing is happening to a lot of universities like Georgia Institute of Technology and so on.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "MM83 Comment Submitted by James X.", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7366", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "If blue-collar Americans are forced to compete with illegal (euphemistically, undocumented) aliens and we import college-educated foreign talent from third world countries to undercut the salaries of American-born graduates, when and where will the race to the bottom end?

In order to maximize their contribution for the United States, I would give them more time to serve the U.S. rather than let them come back to their country and compete with U.S.\nSecond, the new OPT rule won't compromise the working opportunity for U.S. citizen. The key to measure it could be the number of H1B issued every year. In current years, this number hasn't changed. Supposing students having more time, most of them still have to go back to their own country after OPT.\nThird, in response to some comments said the OPT is the reason of citizen losing jobs, it's not. Not all companies are qualified as an E-verify company to hire an international students.

The STEM OPT Extension is primarily used by foreign \"nonimmigrant\" students that come in large numbers to the USA to pursue higher education in STEM areas. These students pay out-of-state fees here to go to school and thus bring in higher revenues to the universities here. Doing away with the STEM OPT Extension or even reducing it any lesser than what it originally was (17 months) may prevent these students from choosing USA as their choice of destination for STEM related higher education and thus decrease the revenue for the Universities here. This decrease in revenue is going to negatively impact teacher salaries, research grants, critical infrastructure development, etc.\n2. Most foreign students that pursue higher education in STEM areas, end up working for science and technology companies here in the USA. These students contribute towards growing these businesses which in turn helps the economy. These students also directly help the economy by paying taxes, social security, medicare and so on. Reducing the STEM OPT extension is going to negatively impact all these areas.\n3.

Being a student on a F1 Visa with a STEM degree who has applied for STEM Extension I feel I am qualified enough to put forth my views regarding this issue. \n\nU.S.A is the land of dreams and opportunities. Every student who enters this country has sacrificed a lot to make studying in U.S.A possible. Let me remind that the admissions to most of the universities in U.S.A is very competitive with only the best being allowed to enter the country. With the skills that they acquire after studying in U.S.A they become a very valuable resource in any job market they enter. \n\nThe STEM industry in U.S.A currently has a shortage of skilled workers. Each large multinational company has so many vacancies that go unfilled each quarter. Again, I can see this happening even at my current company and I do not find it surprising. The proposed STEM extension is just a authorization to students working in renowned companies which are e-verify. \n\nOpposing to the claim that these people steal jobs from the U.S citizens in my experience a company always prefers an equally / less skilled U.S citizen than a foreign personnel because it saves them the trouble to applying for authorization and immigration for the employee. It also saves them the legal advice and process cost which they need to absorb. I would also like to bring it to the notice of concerned people that F1- STEM students are not cheap labor. They are paid equally with respect to any U.S citizen. Hence the company has no motivation to hire a foreign national with STEM extension if they can find a equally skilled U.S citizen since the Cost to Company(CTC) is higher for the STEM Students. \n\nThe people who make these claims might have had some bad experiences in the past during the 2008 recession period, which might have been because of the H1B visa workers. But in no way was it concerned with the STEM OPT students. Carrying this prejudice about we stealing the jobs might leave the STEM industry stranded with the dearth of skilled workers available to them, leading to losses in hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\nWith so much economical impact of the proposed rule, I wish to see this rule get approved as the final rule.

We top the schools at best grades , we create jobs not destroy it , because of me for example my company hired 3 American CAD ( drafters) for the new electrical construction project , because of me and other fellow stem graduate the company profit has grown and reached tremendous heights in this quarter and they are hiring more CAD people , drafters , more HR people of course all Americans, if there is an American who is just as qualified as I am , they get preference anyways because companies find is easier for people - where in they don't have to apply for H1B , green card , and also OPT is a temporary thing its not a permanent sponsorship , so why will company hire anyone of that kind ? the only reason is they are not getting competent local people in the field of engineering  ... Get your facts straight people\n\nThere is one critical aspect to the looked here though. Prevention should be taken to discourage unlawful unemployment in the IT field hiring people from non IT field of in general people working in Non STEM field and taking jobs of people , even they are from STEM field .

Employers avoid the social security tax on their income.  It encourages younger foreign professionals who should be going back to their home country to stay in the US indefinitely, rather than return and help to improve their own country.  It provides bonuses to American companies that hire foreign workers but doesn't provide for the same bonuses for hiring US citizens starting in the workforce.  It is a reason that workers in the IT field have seen stagnant wages for 10 years.  Wouldn't it be great if US citizens got some of these perks to help improve their odds for employment, help the economy and get out of the chronically unemployment line?

The reason I will list as follows:\n\nFirst, Technicians make great contribution to US prosperity. Turn back on US history, tremendous graduates with high technical skills who spreading all the industry, academy, and so on. They do not boost US economy, but make the society stable. They are civil engineer who plan, design, and conduct highways, dams, buildings, making improvement of environment and managing natural environment. They are Chemical engineer who explores the process of materials or production and develop new materials. Here are countless examples to be listed all through US society. On the other hands, seldom see US citizen in this field, and I find most of them are in other fields. Also, as Albert Einstein, who is not citizen of US, but US government at that time approved his status to stay in US legally. Currently, some of graduate student do start up, which are not occupy any job position with citizen, but open more job to US job market and relief the burden of US unemployment.\n\nSecond, this proposal will attract more international students who have plan to study abroad in US. Because they can stay for long time to gain work experience in US which make them more high competitive when go back to their country. The more they enroll in US university, the more contribution to US university, even US. Their life expense will stimulate consumption in US, including rent, travel, transportation etc. \n\nLast, the spiritual of US is diversity, which makes US standing lead in the world. We hope this spirit will last forever. That is US.

There was as gap of 3 years after my 10+2 due to personal situations Also I didn't want to apply for a f-1 with misleading financial documentation which more than 90 percent of visa applicants submit and get visas. I took my time to prepare and secure good SAT general and subject scores to win full scholarship at one of the best universities (which is consistently ranked on par with the best universities in the world especially in my home country).\n\nBut to my great disappointment, visa officer  used 214b  as a easy way out to refuse my visa as prospective immigrant. I am sure the same visa officer may have  issued many f-1 visas to students who used \"personal resources\" to come and study in US just because they didn't have the 3 years gap in education or because they have \"personal resources\" to support their education. More than 90 percent of these people, have most probably, stayed on, using OPT and then applied for h-1b and green card.  The end games turns out to be sheer luck or volume of documentation (now a days there are dime a dozen shops all over the world who provide this for student visas).\n\nIn my own personal experience, I have known at least 100 people who have come  to US in late 1990 and 2000s on f-1 visas  and of them only 4 have returned, but only after acquiring US citizenship and that too after they have sensed some excellent business opportunities or career opportunities back home. \n\nMy very own experience clearly goes on to prove that 99 percent of the subjective decision regarding f-1 visa issuance have proved wrong,both those which were issued and which were rejected. I always wanted to completed my masters and probably PhD and return to my home country to become a professor  with a  different outlook and approach from the locally educated professors;  who, I feel do not have that creative approach to education which Europe or US educated academicians have.\n\nOf course, I have completed my masters in Australia and worked for a while In United Kingdom but now back in my home country ,self employed as a consultant. But I have never again tried for a US visa even when I have had some business opportunity or some invitation because I am greatly shocked by the way in which the subjective US visa decisions are made. From my experience of UK Australia and Canada, where visa officers are given clear guidelines to make Objective decisions rather than subjective decisions, I believe US too can do some thing in this matter.\n\nEven though I have never been to US and also probably might never visit US, but I do show interest in US politics and economy because whether I like it or not, it is the US that drives the world in all spheres that affect the life of an urban dweller any where in the world. \n\nRecently, I was very much moved when a student whose f-1 visa was refused, where as most of his friends with almost similar back ground, got visas and proceeded to US for further studies, took an extreme step. He felt humiliated and committed suicide.\n\nI am fully aware that making f-1 visa a dual intent visa requires legislation rather than administrative action. But after having gone through a lot of your rule making process here and how you have made some guidelines regarding considering some other non immigrant visas as dual intent, I believe, you can do something about it, like establishing clear guidelines in FAM procedural notes to make Objective rather than subjective decisions regarding issuance of f-1 visas, like  students with excellent record,scores and admission at universities of considerable reputation and those with funding from university should not be refused using 214b.\n\nif you do not make this essential change to f-1 visa rule, the total exercise you are doing to enhance ops for f-1 students which would be beneficial to both parties (students as well as US) would be futile as it doesn't give equal consideration to all those who have a dream of studying in US and makes the process a dumb charade and portrays US in a poor light in this age and time when smaller countries like Australia, UK etc have adapted to the changing situations.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shasank Samrat", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4482", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Can't imagine how much will US lose if international students can't work in US", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by yufeng zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15240", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:\nIt takes a total period of 4 years to master the field experience of stem ( like IT experience without 4 years of practical experience is not preferred by an employer).OPT Stem extension should be for 24 months\nWelcome the new proposals (Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan),which will benefit both employer and students.

Reasons are as follows.\n\nFirstly, I am a student in America now. It will be a great experience if I could work for a top company for few years after graduation. And I should have right to do so since I would get my degree in America. There is no reason to refuse such a kind of natural demand from a student just because he is a foreigner, that is not the way of America.\n\nSecondly, most of the top technology companies were born in America and became successful here. These companies not only improved all Americas' lives, they changed the whole world. These companies are becoming the the pillars of the United States. They are so large that the native technical employees are definitely not enough to support them. Without the effort of foreign employees and students, they will not be what they are. Besides, there is no doubt that losing these great companies is not only the loss of we migrant workers but also the loss of American people and this grand country.\n\nThirdly, the policy of OPT could attract more and more outstanding foreign students. That's the most important reason why the United States is the most successful country in the world. What's more, even these students just want to get a degree but not to work here, their will also make a great contribution to the education and economy of America. That's obviously good for everyone including Americans.\n\nI have seen some negative comments here. I know what you are concerning. What I want to say is, everything has both advantages and disadvantages so you are not able to satisfy everybody. \n\nLet's imagine, what if there are no more foreign STEM students in America? That would just be good for native STEM students, because they will be easier to get a job and gain better salary. But these people are just a small part of American. For the most of Americans, that is totally a bad news. You will not be able to find tenants who are willing to pay such a high rent. Companies will not be able to hire enough outstanding employees with less salary. With the recession of companies, most employees who are not STEM will have less income, and the revenue of government will also decrease. That will be a vicious circle for this country since STEM is the most active and creative part of industry. This is not alarmist.\n\nThat's why the expanding of OPT for STEM is so important and will benefit not only foreign students but also the whole country.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yang Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16404", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Look I'm getting sick and tired of Americans getting hurt.

Do a back-on-the-envelope calculation, how many international STEM students are there, and what's the rate of them getting through application for H1B, and then green card and then finally citizenship? \n\nThird, extruding well educated international STEM students after their graduation is an unwise choice because now the tech industries are expanding and they need a lot of qualified workers. High tech companies are big tax payers. We all know our infrastructures need tax.\n\nFinally, the US is an immigrant country, from its foundation, to the abolition of slavery, to the prosperity after WWII, all can not be achieved without its spirit of following the social and technological revolutionary trends, and the encouraging environment for people to contribute without worrying about their race, country of origin, religion and gender. Today, talented, skilled STEM workers is the key for the US to succeed in the worldwide competition of industrial transformation. Allowing international students to stay for two years will greatly help stimulate the job market and economy.

Yes, competition does exists but this is critical to make America become better and better. Competition leads to pressure, pressure generates motivation to be better and this motivation makes US be the most powerful country in the whole world.

In fact, more international students working in STEM field will help to boost fresh graduates employment. Because more STEM workers meaning more managers are needed (and most of international STEM students are not interested in managing people) , and as a matter of fact, the most popular major in America is business administration, so more American students will actually benefit from such policy by becoming managers of these international students. \n\n\nMyth 3: Too many international students will change the culture of American companies.\n\nYes, that's absolutely true. But it is a positive change, because globalization is a competition advantage. \n\n\nMyth 4: STEM extension lowering the bar to become American citizen.\n\nTrue and false. Yes, it makes international students with STEM skills easier to achieve citizenship by allowing them stay longer to work out immigration procedure. But isn't this good change? Best of STEM talents are stay in America, it will help increase the competition edge. \n\n\nMyth 5: New generations of American become more interested in tech. In fact , number of Computer Science students are increasing each year. At that time, many of international students work in tech companies will become managers, and their nepotism will make them prefer fellow international students.\n\nThat's not going to happen. First because many of international students only like their major, they don't like management. Americans are going to be hiring manager, not these international workers. In fact, majority of hiring managers in tech companies are American. Most of senior executives of tech companies are also American (there only a few neutralized Americans who become executives)\n\nMyth 6: Looking at what is happening in Europe! Let foreigners flock into our country will damage our society!\n\nThat's nonsense. Because STEM students are going to have a job, they will create values for society, not suck up society.\n\n\nMyth 7:  Many tech companies are laying off people this year! America no longer needs foreign STEM workers.\n\nVery wrong. Only a few tech companies laid off people. There is no sign that tech industry is slowing down.\n\nMyth 8: Experienced foreign STEM students will make companies become reluctant to hire Americans who don't have technical skills yet ( even though these American can qualify those jobs after a few months training)\n\nNot true. Experienced foreign STEM students are unsubstuitble, because becoming experienced will require many years of training, not just a few years.\n\nMyth 9: STEM Extension is unfair because foreign students work in STEM fields are not paying Social Security / Medicare that American would need to pay.\n\nThat's true, it is unfair but it's legal. But it has nothing to do with STEM extension. If you don't like, you can submit a proposal to ask them pay. \n\nMyth 10: STEM extension will attract more foreign students studying in US, which will make American universities admit less American students.\n\nNot true. Because these foreign students are paying more than American students, so their extra tuition actually helped the university to admit more American students.\n\nIn summary, STEM extension is good for American. All your worries are worries are redundant. In fact, America should also entrepreneur visa to invite students all over the world come to America, create startups and hire more Americans.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jack Z", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12341", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT.\n\nThis proposal embodies the concept of \"American Dream\".

I am currently on STEM OPT working in academia, so technically I don't need STEM OPT and my application to J-1 or H-1b visa won't be capped. I had paid $380 for applying STEM OPT but the court ruling that vacated STEM OPT made my employer pay another $290 to maintain a legal immigration status for me.\n\nAll that was stated above means that STEM OPT, even if extended to 24 or 36 or 48 months, will not benefit myself any longer. However, what I want to say here is that STEM OPT greatly benefits the United States as a nation; limiting the possibility for international students to get practical training in the US will lead to great loss for the American people.\n\nFirst, the approval or disapproval of the STEM OPT rule will show the world what role the United States is playing in the 21st century. Is United States the same country that is open for great minds, latest technologies, and diverse culture as before? Will United States continue to lead the footprints of human civilization and propagate its core values to the entire world? The STEM OPT rule is actually a pretty small issue that affects about 100,000 students in this country. I hope the United States is not so fragile that it would collapse by allowing these students to get some training and have some experience in the most advanced territory in the world.\n\nSecond, not every international student would die for just being eligible to be employed in the US. If the United States is unwilling to let us stay here for a few years' training, we would simply go back to our home countries and get a job there, probably with lower living cost. THE HARD TRUTH is that if you are capable and strong enough and have the right skill set, NOBODY can prevent you from being employed, whether in the US or in other countries. The United States is in shortage of workers in the STEM degrees, and deporting a good chunk of students that have mastered the most advanced technologies would make the situation worse. And you guess what, those being deported would not starve but build their own countries. I am now teaching college mathematics at another top-10 public university, and more than half of the students are foreign nationals. THIS is the current situation in American education.\n\nThird, contrary to the common belief that employers hire foreign nationals for cheaper labor, the salaries that international students receive are very competitive, from academia to industry. I am getting the same amount on my paycheck as my US-citizen colleagues; my friends who were international students, now working in big tech firms, are getting the same amount on their paycheck as their US-citizen coworkers. I can't emphasize this more: If you are capable enough for your job, nobody can keep you from getting a decent salary.\n\nLastly, of course, the STEM OPT rule would benefit international students as well: We see what it's like to work in the real world, we experience the wonderful American cultures, and we make lots of friends with American people. But without it, we won't lose much either.

For non-STEM areas, OPT STEM does not apply to international students at all, which means the work opportunities available to US citizens in these areas will not be reduced at all. On the other hand, in STEM areas, although OPT STEM allows more international talents to work in US, it will also increase the absolute amount of working opportunities to US citizens in the long term.\n\nPeople with extraordinary skills are the key to improve the power of the country and push the development of the society. This is especially true in STEM areas. United States, as a country built by talents from all over the world, is currently the most creative, most productive and strongest country in the world. This is due to its open policy for importing talents, regardless of their citizenship. However, talents now find it harder and harder to stay in US to use their extraordinary ability. The limitations on immigration policy is already out-of-date, and the existence of H1B lottery is a good proof it. There is an urgent need to improve this situation. A country without rapid economics increases will never have enough energy to create sufficient open jobs in the market, making the country less attractive to hi-tech workers, thus slowing down its development even more. This is a negative feedback, which will eventually take US out from the top place in the list of countries attractive to talents, weaken its economy and technology rankings in the world, and reduce the amount of available open jobs. This impairs benefits of both US citizens of international talents, hence we should not allow it to happen.\n\nBy contrast, the 24 month OPT STEM is the ideal solution to turn it into a positive-feedback and benefits both US citizens and international talents together. International students studying in the US usually have better skills in their studying areas compared to people staying in their own countries. The key to maintain a sustainable development of the workforce market is to keep these talents in the US. 24 month OPT STEM gives US employers more time to hire international talents, providing these talents with longer duration to contribute to US. Moreover, it also gives US employers longer time to filter out the best from the best people, and make their workforce most productive and of highest quality. Another benefit of 24 month OPT STEM is, it gives hi-tech workers more chances to apply for H1B work VISA, improving the likelihood of their long-term staying in the US and continuous contribution to the US economy. Only by keeping the top level workforce can the US job market keep growing and provide larger amount of jobs to US citizens.\n\nMaintaining the attractiveness to talents worldwide is the key to ensure the overall welfare of US people and government, as well as an energetic job market filled with more opportunities for US people. There is no reason to the reject such a good rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kaiyu Yan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2424", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": " i completely support in increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months from current 17 months. i believe this proposed rule is really necessary for currents students and future students to obtain practical training.

They spend a lot of money (from $60,000 to $20,000 on average) on their academic program. The aim of learning is to make practice. The reason that STEM students are willing to spend so much money studying in America is that America provides a lot of opportunities for STEM students to make practice with OPT program. If OPT extension is cancelled, many students will choice other countries, like British, Japan, Singapore, Canada, etc for study. America academic Institutes will lose many high-quality students,which will no doubt harm the competitiveness, as well as revenue. Other related impact cannot be ignored, like rent market. In term of my own experience, when I studied in Northeastern university during 2012-2014, most of houses and apartments in Malden, Quincy, Cambridge, etc are rent by foreign students(more than 50% of them are STEM students). If foreign students decreases, it will definitely have bad impact on local rent market.\n\nSecond, a lot of programs in company takes more than one year. OPT extension is definitely needed to guarantee such programs can be completed. Failure of completing programs have bad impact on both companies and STEM students. Company cannot get benefits from those aborted programs and STEM students cannot get enough practice. What's more, STEM students usually need several months to find a position in a company after they graduate. The time spent on program is usually less than 1 year.  Taking myself as an example, I joined in Facebook in February, about one month after OPT started. After 2 months training, I joined in an important team. I work on a very important A/B testing platform program which is used by more than 20 teams and directly have impact on revenue. I have worked on it for about 6 months, but still have a lot of work to do. It is NOT possible to complete all left work in another 6 months.  If I left at the end of this year, it is hard to find another person to take the position well since it needs a lot of background knowledge and enough practice. The potential impact on Facebook cannot be evaluated. OPT extension is necessary for both companies and STEM students.\n\nThird, STEM students usually take high-tech positions with high-level pay. In terms of my knowledge, most of STEM students joined in high-tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Broadcom, Airbnb, Uber, etc. Taking myself as an example, 15 of my friends join in Amazon, 4 join Facebook, 2 join Google, 2 join Oracle, 1 join Apple, 4 join EMC, 1 joins Broadcom, etc, with an average wage of $10,0000 per year.  All of them takes high-tech positions in those companies. Their contributions to those companies should be well evaluated. Whats' more, each person on average contributes about $35,000 tax to State and Federal governments. There are now about 300, 000 (or more) STEM students working with OPT or OPT extension. They create about 10 billion dollars tax! Those taxes are finally used for Americas' health care, public utilities, non-profit organization, education, etc. All of these have big benefits to Americas!  Also, their positions are high-tech with high-pay, which definitely have no impact on human resource market for ordinary Americas, like drivers, car washers, cashier, etc.\n\nForth, the new OPT program with 2 years can help STEM students have enough training. With 3 years training, they can gain enough industry experiences and completeness when the go back to their countries. \n\nTo summary, OPT and OPT extension has the following benefits. 1. keep America academic completeness in the world. 2. Promote local economics. 3. Play important role in America high-tech industry. 4. Big contributions to government taxes. 5. Help STEM students gain more training and experiences.\n\nOPT and OPT extension has so many benefits to Americas. I do NOT see any obvious negative impact on Americas. We should definitely SUPPORT this new rules!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dianshi Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17203", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly approve this!

Employers save 7.65% when they hire foreign students instead of US workers, as they don't pay either FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. The DHS, by defining a recent college graduate as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes.  That is to say that, since these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay any payroll taxes, and will save the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.  Also, it will penalize the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, directly, and our elders, indirectly.  So, although OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, they are costing the Social Security program about $1 billion dollars a year. \n\nA 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI) found that there are already plenty of American workers, with and without degrees, such as myself, who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in the IT sectors.  This program will not only artificially expand the domestic labor pool, by the hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be almost guaranteed to neither unionize, nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\n\nThis proposed rule will push the people, who were raised and trained at home, out of the same job market that these education initiatives were created for, and handing those jobs to students who have no ties to the U.S. other than their education.\n\nUnder OPT, U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary.  It can be above $10,000.  And if that bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\n\nEncouraging additional foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time here in the United States will have one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields. Like other employment-visa programs, OPT ensures that having more foreign-born graduates will take jobs that American college students desperately need, working to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.    Tech workers' wages have already been flat for years, and thousands of American STEM grads have been out of work, although the tech executives and shareholders are have been rolling in money for the same time-period.  \n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.  But, if the U.S. really \"needs\" these foreign students to remedy an alleged STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?  And, if workers with such training are really needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n\nAs I understand it, there is no actual training in this program anyway.  It is just one more foreign-worker program, which has nothing to do with students.  It is just for recent alien college graduates.  It is pure fiction that any person who holds a master's degree in electrical engineering, perhaps completing it in as little as 12 months, still needs an additional three years to work as an intern (at low or no pay in many cases), just to be a productive professional. \n\nThe DHS is neglecting its duty, under federal guidance, to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.  Not to mention that the worker protections included in the new rule are so vague and deferential to employers, that they will be virtually unenforceable.\n\n\nAs an older (age 56) worker who has recently had to make a career change from the electronics field to the IT field, and who has lost a lot of retirement funds in the process, I am affected by the competition for jobs, the artificial depression of wages, and accelerated loss of the retirement funds available to me in the Social Security program.\n\nPlease do not implement this program.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Perry Bonney", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4540", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I completely support the OPT STEM extension for 7 more months making it a total of 24 months.

Foreign student come to US for 2-year degree will contribute will contribute $200000.00 with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other cost. These money comes from the foreign students themselves not scholarship. Actually, scholarship for foreign students in 2-year degree is not common.

From the local US high school, we learned the American dream, that every US citizen should have an equal opportunity to achieve success and and prosperity through hard work, determination, and initiative. Though I'm not an US citizen, yet I do believe in hard work, determination and initiative, and that's the reason I choose to apply for college in the US and studying Petroleum Engineering, and hoping that someday I can also achieve my \"American dream\".\n\nI understand that there are people claiming against the extension of OPT, since they think international students had taken many job opportunities of many local US citizens. To my opinion, the extension of OPT is just an opportunity for international students to try to apply for jobs in the US, and also limited to the STEM majors, which requires hard-works in science, maths and other engineering technologies. International students who wants to use OPT as the opportunity to apply for jobs in US, must complete their four-year-degree in the US college with a good GPA. At least all the international students who need OPT extension are those who are willing to learn, who are willing to do the hard-work, who are willing to sacrifice their personal happiness back in hometown and study as an ESL (English as an second language ) speaker. Though we are not American citizens, but we do have something similar as the American spirit, and we are willing to contribute to the society just as every other US citizens do. \n\nSo why can't we at least have this opportunity to make contributions and proof our values? I believed that every person that are standing in this nation with believes in hard work, determination and making contributions to the society, should be at least given the opportunity to achieve success and make United States and make America a better place, and that's my understanding of the American dream!\n\nSincerely,\nXiexiaomeng(Jack) Hu\n11/08/2015", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiexiaomeng Hu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16576", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Einstein didnt born in the U.S., most of the anti-immigrants has no flict with stem students.

It is in the best interest of both the US and of foreign students to provide an opportunity for students to work part time in their field, and to work in the US full time after graduation.\n\nI take exception to \nV. Discussion of Elements of the STEM OPT Extension\nG. Safeguarding U.S. Workers Through Measures Consistent With Labor Market Protections\n\nIt states: \"the STEM labor shortage described in the 2008 IFR was well documented\". (Ok, technically it says that \"many commenters noted that\", but the document seems to accept that claim without reservation.) Some businesses *claim* that there is a STEM labor shortage in the US, but hiring practices and STEM graduate unemployment belie that assertion. In fact, there is a shortage of businesses willing to pay prevailing wages and to train their existing workers on new techniques. Said businesses seek foreign laborers that will accept lower wages, and will be unable to complain about poor conditions because they are tied to the business by the conditions of their visa.\n\nI would say that adequate safeguards for US workers require at least these 2 provisions:\n1) Workers need to be able to change jobs at will, and accept that there may be periods of unemployment. As long as the person is seeking work and able to support themself then they should be able to stay for up to their visa length. \n2) Companies hiring workers on a temporary visa need to pay them at least as much as they currently pay a US worker in a similar position, or at least 1% above the prevailing wage for that job in that geographic region, whichever is greater.\n\nNote that I refer to \"workers\", not \"students\". These conditions are minimum safeguards for US workers for ANY term limited work visa, be it F-1, H-1B, or whatever. Changing the status of aliens from effectively an indentured servant to a valued worker will do more to protect both the US and the alien worker than any number of attestations of need. It will remove the temptation for the company to hire foreign workers to displace US workers, and will provide better working conditions and wages for guest workers.\n\nIn a similar vein, the whole of \nV. Discussion of Elements of the STEM OPT Extension\nD. Mentoring and Training Plan\nis ludicrous. Either the students educated by a school are trained, or they are not. The conceit that US students are trained while foreign students need further mentoring is ridiculous. I do not object to a company having an internship program, in fact I think that paid summer internships are a wonderful thing AS LONG AS THE COMPANY TREATS ALL INTERNS EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF ORIGIN. \n\nIf a company does not believe that an individual is a cost-effective hire due to language barrier, social skills, or lack of technical training then the company should not hire that individual. But they should not be able to hire at a lower wage because of nationality.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kai Hintze", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4866", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am in favor of homeland security point.

The main reason that I concern about is the economy of the U.S. and the win-win situation for both U.S. government and those international students in STEM fields. \n First, the 24 months OPT extension for STEM F1 students can appeal more international students.  According to U.S. news, U.S. enrolled a record- breaking number of international students during the 2013-2014 school year, and the number of new undergraduate and graduates students is 886,052.  The overall number of international students in the U.S. has grown 72 percent since 2000. Students from China, India and South Korea represent about half of all international students in the U.S.  Much of the increase in international students in the U.S. during 2013-2014 was fueled by undergraduate students from China. The number of Chinese students increased to 31 percent of all international students in the U.S.  As an international student from China, I want to go to the U.S. for school because I think the technologies in the science field is better than China. Also, I want to stay longer in the U.S. to learn more about the technologies in industries and international business opportunities. I think many international students would have the same thought as me. Thus, the opportunities for us to be allowed to work at the U.S. is very important when we decide to come to universities or colleges in the U.S.  I believe if there is no OPT extension, the number of international students will decrease at least 30% of the total. If so, the decreased number of international students would be at least 265,815 each year. \nLet us look at the economic loss if there is 265,815 less international students each year in the U.S. First, the tuition for universities, if 70% of those students go to a 4-year undergraduate school (90,000 in total for 4 years) and 30% of them go to graduate school (40,000 in total for 2 years), tuition loss would be around 20 billion a year. The daily activities including housing, food shopping, dining, car buying, museums, theme parks, tax and etc. will decrease about 6 billion a year if each student spend about 20,000 a year. Also, those students friends or parents will probably visit them during that time.

But because it could really help the students who put up at least 2 or more years of their academic life here. This brings up so much of foreign wealth, diversity, intellect and what not to American education system. The students on F-1 visa status contributes a lot more than just money to the system. They are helping the highly revered american university education thrive more by trusting them with their money which goes in not just academic fees but in other forms. \n\nFor instance most of the graduate students in private research universities that are based in city area and are urban setted, are not provided with housing facilities. They pay high amount of money for their accommodations and also in daily expenses. These large in flow of students to cities help thrive local businesses run well, create job and improve overall economy of city. You sum up these cities and you get a better economy for the nation. \n\nInstead of talking very specifics and high level details. I would request readers of this comment to focus on the smaller positive changes that this foreign students bring to US. A positive change from lowest level of economy to most higher level. \n\nAfter graduating from the universities the main reason they tend to stay back for a couple of years so that they can better utilized their learn skills in practical scenarios. They become part of most wanted and skilled workforce that helps US to be a better nation in all aspects. Some of them go and start their own venture, start ups creating more jobs for the country. \n\nThese two factions of F-1 students I mentioned in last paragraph evidently benefits all factions of US. Talking about diversity, they bring immense cultural diversity. Talking about economic growth, they are helping all major parts of economy to grow at better rate by paying higher taxes, creating new jobs etc. Talking about research and intellectual property, they are helping US to be world leader in STEM on a global platform. \n\nAlso, the cost of education in US is very high as compared to other nations like Germany, UK and Australia. Universities offering STEM research needs an ample amount of grants from Government to carry on their research and run smoothly. The influx of money generated from the fees payed by the F-1 students help in one way or other to maintain their standard. \n\nPublic School education system in US is already under so much scrutiny and criticism for many reasons. We don't wish this same thing to happen to universities of this country just because they no longer have large proportions of foreign students paying high fees to keep them running and maintaining their long term goals. \n\nTo keep the students from other parts of world motivated and have faith in US higher education system, we need to given them reasons for doing so. This new proposed rule helps maintaining that faith in students. They would be encouraged to join the universities here seeing a chance to apply their skills after they graduate. \n\nI cannot strongly agree more or emphasize the positive outcomes of the new proposed rule.

It also helps it improve competitiveness vis--vis other developed nations. US has to compete today with new and faster growing economies like China and India. The following points support the above hypotheses\n\n1. US educated international students have undergone an education system that is continually tuned and updated for the innovative needs of US Industries. By letting them go out of the country, they carry the learning with them and benefit their country of origin than the USA. \n2. Supply of STEM graduates in US cannot cope up with demand leading to companies directly hiring from overseas undergrad colleges, putting US graduates and undergraduates at a disadvantage and increasing costs (companies have to incur higher costs to recruit from overseas)to the nation.\n3. The OPT extension opportunity will encourage more students to study in the USA (vis--vis other countries) thus supporting the US economy further.\n4. Balancing supply of STEM skilled workforce with demand helps keep the labor rates competitive for the industry and keeps costs and inflation down.\n5. By increasing OPT duration, the nation will be able to reduce dependence on H1B, as companies will have the option to assess competencies of the US educated graduates during the OPT period and give them the first shot at an H1B, before looking for overseas candidates. This gives the nation to seek a good balance between OPT and H1B programs.\n6. Education in the US not only increases their skills, but also improves their skills in sports, soft skills, confidence and managerial capabilities; which are not usually an area of focus for international colleges. Thus parting by with a US educated undergraduate student the nation loses more than just their technical competence.\n\nIn short, extending the OPT program will make the US a preferred destination for higher education, give opportunities to companies to recruit locally and the retain the best of the best (through H1B) which eventually is a best solution in the long term.

Its like you are having a 100-meter race with the foreign student, but ahead of 30 meters at the very beginning.

Not exactly, because of the motherfxxcker H1B lottery policy. More than 172,500 petitions with 85,000 acceptance.

The US, in the eyes of hopeful foreign students from abroad, is a land of opportunity and fairness for those who work hard, and the OPT program and STEM extension is a central part that realizes this. If the government removes this rule, the US will no longer seem as welcoming to students wanting to study abroad and then contribute to the technology and innovations in the US. The US would lose in their lead of technological innovations, as more and more young and skilled individuals, instead of contributing to the US economy, compete against the US in all manners of scientific advancements, entrepreneurship, education, and public policy. In 2011 Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers internationally and they are responsible for $1.7 trillion in revenues. \n\nThe world is always going to have an influx of young people seeking the best opportunities, wherever they are, and the US would be giving up a wealthy source of people with great skills and potential by not allowing them a chance to contribute. The US would only gain a short term, false sense of relief that there are lesser competitors taking jobs away but at the cost of long term benefits of leadership in higher education, scientific research and technological innovations. \n\n2. All international students are aware of the slight discrimination against them during job hunting due to the fact that companies need to sponsor them a work visa. If the STEM extension is ruled out, many companies would refrain even further from hiring international students that would only have a single chance, and not two or three chances, to obtain an H1B visa, because only about 1/3 of all applicants obtain an H1B, and they can only stay for a year or even less in the company. Also, for many high tech companies like OLI Systems, training takes 6 months and there isn't enough time to decide if a worker is worth sponsoring, which takes thousands of dollars each time for each individual sponsored. All of this works against the US economy because it prevents high tech companies from hiring highly skilled workers, which they are starving of. \n\n3. Letting talents of these students leave the US would actually decrease jobs, because companies seeking talent would be hiring from other countries with lower pay and high quality. Also, immigrants are twice as more likely to be entrepreneurs and start business than native born Americans, according to the Kauffman Foundation. These entrepreneurs, if educated in the US with US degrees will allow the US the gain far greater revenues and jobs than deporting them to their home countries.\n\n4. Many of the comments are from fear of competition in the job market. However, to reject international students simply because of this will only stagnate the job market and lower the standards on education and skillset levels, as healthy competition always increases efficiency and development. If a class has a wide range of smart children and slower children, will you simply move the smart children out of the classroom? No, you would help the slower children become more effective and be more aware. Therefore, the US deporting students under STEM extension is only serving to detriment US capabilities. \n\n5. For me personally, if this rule is rejected, and I cannot obtain an H1B, I would obviously be forced to return to my home country.

So a shorter time of opt extension, to some extent, equals to zero. In order to maximizing the benefits of STEM graduates, a longer extension will harvest.\n\nAs for students, we need a longer extension before we find a job back in our countries. First, raised in different cultures, we are more used to our native environment than American. So that wish encourages us to build our life back in home town. I have a lot of mideast friends. They all dream of going back and putting what they have learnt into their working areas. However, before serving our own societies, we need a good resume. That why we want a longer extension.

Having OPT extension, more students will come to the US and there is higher chance to attract best talents to stay which is very important for the US because the world now driven by creativity. The creativity needs best talents and just imagine if they are not allowed to work in the US. When they go back to their own country, they will start up new companies that will compete with US companies. All these knowledge are leaned from US universities and all the skills are gained in the US companies. \nSecond, statistically all the high tech companies are lack of labors. If America doesnt allow them to stay, there is surely not enough people to work and to drive the Americas leading position in the world. \nAlso, extending the OPT will have more people come to the US to study. These students needs to eat, buy cars, rent a house, travel around the US, etc. They can bring lots of working opportunities in all kinds of industries. \nI think this rule is more beneficial to the US economy and will strengthen the leading position in the world.

On the one hand, earning more profits can benefit the U.S. economy and giving more tax to U.S. government and U.S. people. On the other hand, the international students are all gifted students in their own countries, attracting and hiring them in U.S. high tech companies can help these companies compete with their competitors all around the world which will also finally strengthen the leadership of U.S. high-tech field.\n\nSome U.S. citizens might be afraid of losing their jobs. However, the STEM extension proposal is only proposed for international students obtaining STEM degrees in U.S. and working in STEM related areas. There are still a large number of job opportunities in other fields. Besides, even for STEM related fields, all the U.S. companies prefer U.S. citizens if they have the same skill set and capability of working in these areas because they do not have any restriction while the international students need more money and H1B permission to work. However, the situation right now is that, although the high-tech companies want to hire U.S. citizens, there are not enough citizens in these areas, that's why these companies need to spend more time and money on hiring more and more international students in order to keep competing with other companies all around the world. Please do remember, hiring an international student might cost more than hiring a U.S. citizen for the companies need to consider the loss of hiring international employees because of H1B lottery. They do this only because there are not enough qualified U.S. citizens.\n\nU.S. is a country consists of immigrations. The fundamental reason that U.S. can be the number one in the world for more than half of of the centuries is that it is keeping attracting outstanding persons all around the world to contribute for this country. Now that those international students have already got the knowledge in their related areas, why can't we make fully use of their skills for U.S.? It is better to attract them working for U.S. companies rather than other competitors in other countries.\n\nAs for the worries about the job opportunity. Spending more time to improve the skill in STEM areas will definitely give everyone the good job opportunity. We are facing the time of globalization. Competitions are everywhere, only the strong persons and companies can win the competitions, free competition is also the spirit of U.S.. If the citizenship is the requirement for hiring persons, more and more well-educated persons will be in other countries which will in turn destroy the STEM related companies in U.S. and finally lose more jobs for U.S. citizens.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Candice  Cochran", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19368", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "America is an opening country for any people who has a hopeful dream and want to realize it.

Right now I'm working as full time software development engineer in Google on my OPT period. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI strongly propose the new OPT rule extending the training opportunity of F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degree with the following reasons.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nWe know that the STEM extension rule is to provide extensive opportunity for training and expanding their technical skills in industry and this is very essential for integration the knowledge they learned in their university with practical on-hands experience. This is not only beneficial for our STEM graduates but all the US top educational institutes as well. Education is not just telling you the knowledge but let you get well benefits in actual projects. That's why this rule can keep the US high level education so attractive and competitive all over the world. I remember that when I decided to study aboard and wonder which country or university I should go, having the practical training in industry was a very important factor I had considered.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nIt is very apparently that expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Without their efforts I believe that many tech giants would not go so far nowadays, for STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe new STEM rule should be extended to 24 months\n\nWe know that for STEM students their training opportunity cannot be accomplished within one year or even two years, for their involvement in the project make it impossible to ask them leave in the middle of progress and that would have too much cost for employer to hire another one to replace their work. Once they complete that, they would create much impact for their employers and also benefits for themselves.\n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule and make the policy consistence for all the STEM students. Like me who have just applied the STEM OPT, we really hope this rule would be effective for students who has already in the extension period. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule-making.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWish the best of you!\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Eric Xiao, Northwestern University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12320", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a retired CBP officer I have seen the mass influx of these students and now the government wants more.

Successive waves of immigrants have kept our country demographically young, enriched our culture, brought innovative ideas and entrepreneurial spirit to the U.S. economy, keeping enhancing our influence in the world.\n\nBut immigration has always been controversial in this country. More than two hundreds years ago, Benjamin Franklin worried that too many German immigrants would swamp America's predominantly British culture. In the mid-1800s, Irish immigrants were scorned as lazy drunks. Then a wave of \"new immigrants\", Italians, Jews, were believed to steal American's jobs and destroy this country. Today the same fears are raised about immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Some people even against the high-skilled, American university-trained students.\n\nI would like to say Immigration is not undermining the American dream, it is an integral part of it! At least we need to make sure the smartest minds stay here to grow the economy, create jobs, allow our companies to compete globally. It is a current issue also a long term growth issue. A forward-looking immigration strategy that allow longer OPT, more H-1B visas, more green cards for high skilled workers is particularly and urgently needed!\n\nOur colleges and universities are full of students who come here from aboard to study at the highest levels.

Living in the US made me realized that I have value and I can be a scientist even though I am a girl. After four years hard work, I finally got an offer from Microsoft. Now I have the chance to learn from the best company in the world and contribute to the most exciting leading technology. I am very happy but also worried at the same time. If the opt extension for STEM students were canceled, I only have 12 months to work and learn. 12 months are too short to accomplish anything for STEM students. It takes time to develop great science and technology. Many international students come to the US to pursue science and technology because we believe in American dreams. That is, as long as we work hard, we will be given the chance to contribute to the greatest science and technology in the world no matter where we come from. All we ask is a little more time. With the 24 months opt extension, I believe international students who are so brilliant and hardworking will have great contributions to science and technology.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by juan kou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13732", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I understand that there are opposing voices towards OPT extension, but for the long run, I believe this proposal is greatly beneficial to the country.\n\nEconomically: Doubtlessly, STEM students bring significant income to the colleges, which helps lessen universities' financial debt, therefore lowers average educational cost for local students.

The jobs taken by the STEM international students are not the normal jobs that provide living expenses, but the high technical jobs require higher education degrees. On one hand, the US need to create more jobs for citizens. However, on the other hand, the US need people on STEM related career. If you simply, brutally cut down the visa for these international students for science, technology etc related fields, it will do nothing good for the whole economy, and even worse, cause more problems in satisfying the need for thee society.\n\n2. The role of international students actually is a producer of the wealth of the society, instead of taking benefits from the society. People who work hard on STEM related fields are young, well-educated and they are able to work, to pay the tax, to maintain the benefits(medical, retirements, etc) for the rest of the society. These people, together with other americans, work hard and pay their tax to government. It is not wise for american government to kick out these intelligent, hard working people out. Then the burden on american citizen will be increased.\n\n3. It is a worldwide problem that the society is getting aged. The proportion of senior people is growing bigger and bigger in Europe, Asia, etc. Low new birth rate is a problem in many countries. Thanks to the immigrations, it does not bother US as much as in other area of the world. Immigrants  was the fundamental of American, and should always be. \n\n4. The ones who claim \"immigrations took their jobs\" should not point this to the STEM people. Actually, US need these STEM people more than ever. For example, US is in great need of engineers nowadays. Some of US citizens are good engineers, but it is not enough. If we simply reject international STEM people out of US, for \"create jobs\", the actual result is to cause economic lose for the industry. As a consequence, more jobs will be lost in the industry chain. In contrast, if STEM people managed to make their contribution on their career, the economy will be increased and thus more jobs will be created for the US citizen. \n\nTo summary, US will benefit from extending STEM. People who think international people took american's jobs are short-sighted. They simply confused the STEM people with all other illegal immigrants and they are rejecting something that do GOOD to US. I definitely support STEM. I work in Mathematical Science and I met lots of good international people. It is amazing that US allow such diversity in our life.

I believe the OPT extension proposal (No. ICEB-2008-0002) is one of the best policies that could possibly keep the US economy competitive.

The current immigration law makes it very hard for these students to work legally in the United States even if they are hired by the high-tech companies. If we force them to return to their home country, they will only support the tech companies in their country and our highest level education system is just teaching and training students who work for our competitors.

First, the STEM industry is in lack of human resource, so that a foreign student in those fields does not \"occupy\" a position for local workers.

As a top student in my class, I could have gone to the US, UK, Canada, Australia among many others. When I was job hunting last year, I was again facing a crossroad - US, Hong Kong, mainland China, Canada, UK... In both cases, I chose America because I believe in the opportunities and development here. I believe in this society as a decent and just environment that rewards virtue and merit. If America decides to throw these human capital like us out, I guess I was wrong and would have considered otherwise. \n2.\tI know that a lot of people understand H1B as tech companies' conspiracy to get cheap labor or consider high skill immigrants a threat to American jobs. This is, honestly, quite insulting. The truth is there are so many people like me - Ivy League or other top notched university educated and are willing to contribute to this country - who depend on H1B to stay here. We did not come here to be cheap labor.\n3.\tWe are not stealing jobs from Americans. Quite on the contrary, influx of high-quality human capital is what kept a country more competitive in the world market. This is true in Silicon Valley and is true everywhere else.

It is short-sighted, unwise and against American people's interests to reject international students' rights to work in the US. \n\nFirst, the STEM graduates have invested huge amounts of money and time during their study in American universities. Having a decent degree from American top universities, they deserve a job in the country. According to the news in NY Times, \"by the reckoning of the Institute of International Education, foreign students in the United States contribute about $21 billion a year to the national economy\" (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/education/international-students-pay-top-dollar-at-us-colleges.html?_r=0). The US universities need international students to balance their budget. If the proposal is rejected, the attraction for international students, who value the great opportunities that the American companies can provide, will surely decline and the universities won't have enough money to improve their education for American students.\n\nOn top of that,  international STEM graduates boost the technological and scientific fields in the US. According to a survey conducted by the National Venture Capital Association, 40% of immigrant entrepreneurs in recent venture-funded companies first entered the country as international students. If these students can't work in the US and be sent back to their home countries, they will become strong competitors to the American companies in the future.\n\nFinally, some are against the proposal simply since they believe that the minimum wages don't get raised simply because there are too many international graduates. This belief is against the fact. International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all the international students in an OPT are trying to get an H1-b, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, while the minimum wage limit in NY state is $9.00. This is almost three times!

I have to say the OPT extension is a win-win policy for the US as well as STEM students. The international students studying STEM are the most important human resources for the development of high-tech industry in the US. If the extension is cancelled, the students who have received the high education will be forced to come back to their own countries and then serve their countries. The American companies which highly rely on the international students will be less competitive compared to the developing countries, such as China. I don't think this is an appropriate way to protect the interest of the US.\n\n  Furthermore, the number of students coming to the US for studying will definitely decrease drastically if the OPT extension is cancelled because they know they cannot stay in the US after graduation. Then the international students will distribute to other countries rather than America. Because there are a lot of international students in the American colleges, the cancellation of the OPT extension will have a negative impact on the total enrollment for the colleges. For example, in my graduate school, the international student is even outnumber the native American student. So there will be a great loss for the universities if the extension is rescinded.\n\n  The USA has been nation of immigrants since it was founded. During the World War 2, the Jewish scientists came to the US and produced countless scientific achievements. Today, the international students with high educational background are also contributing to the development of the US. Therefore, I need to point out that the international students are not a burden for the US society. On the contrary, they are creating the employments and the development of technology for the US.\n\n  Thank you for your consideration!\n\nSincerely,\n\nYaoshen Yuan", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yaoshen Yuan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22578", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "24 monthsof cause", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lu Cao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1137", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please grant this to those students.

Some of them said foreign students took away citizen's job and list the amount, but i think the amount is the total number of jobs got by foreign students last year.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated  in 2014  with a master's degree in the field of  computer science The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nMahendra", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by MAHENDRA PASUPULETI", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10421", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The extension of the OPT program should not be allowed.In fact it should be shortened.

The United States have recently stepped out of the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis, and we have seen the economy is getting stronger and booming since the beginning of 2015. More jobs have been added this year, and the unemployment level has been kept at a relatively low level compared to mid-crisis. This means that more Americans than that of mid-crisis era have jobs. There is still strong demand in the job market. This means that we can open up the opportunities to foreign students who study in the U.S. and have expertise. These students would fill in the positions which are left out of most Americans' interest. Most technology companies are built on technology immigrants, such as google, facebook and dropbox. Many of the modeling analysts in the big financial firms, data science firms are international students as well. We can see the success of these firms, and we can certainly infer that with the help of the international students, the U.S. economy would be booming as well. I almost think that the employment rate of Americans is positively affected by international students hired. Think about it, international students with high skill sets can help small business to grow and extend the life of the business, leading to more jobs available on the market. How many jobs has Silicone Valley created?\nIn comparison, Canada has a policy authorizing foreign students three years to work legally in Canada post-graduation to attract the talents. I do think United States should do the same thing to keep ahead in the global competition. \nHowever, I do feel a little concerned about the criterion that the employers need to meet to be able to extend OPT for international students. Some of them are not necessary and could be harmful. I think what we should fully understand is that neither OPT nor OPT extension guarantees a full time job, so just like the contract jobs, I don't think training/benefit package should be enforced here.

The H-1B program abuses by some corporations is appalling, and now we are going to consider doing the stem workers another wrong through the OPT program. We MUST help get our own American citizen workers back to stable jobs to support both the worker and our country. Here are a few things I would want to here an answer to.\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. From Senator Grassley, \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\" From John Miano, \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\" From Norm Matloff of UC Davis, \"On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\" \"If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\" \"If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\" \"OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\" From Richard Trumpka, President ALF-CIO, \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\" From David North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department, \"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\", \"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\" From Ron Hira of Howard University, \"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.\" From Ian Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, \"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\" \"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\" \nOur schools are pushing science and math like never before, but we are eliminating those jobs our own children would be able to get. This makes no sense to me, other than to line the pockets of corporations. We do not \"need\" more stem workers from other countries, but NEED to support our own citizen workers.

Immigrants are in almost every leading industry of America, from Silicon Valley to Hollywood, from sports to Wall Street. \n\nBringing the greatest minds, regardless of where they are from. America's openness and freedom in technology towards most talented people over the world, is one important factor that this country has become, and is maintaining the leader of the world for science and technology. First railway, first computer, first atomic bomb, first moon landing... foreigners are behind every influential projects of this country, making their contributions. America has selected them, and they have selected to become American.\n\nForeigners are making contribution to America's STEM industry. Many talented people in STEM fields are not born in this country. Elon Musk, founder of Uber, is from South Africa. CEO of Google and Microsoft are from India. One founder of Garmin GPS is from Taiwan. Even though a large percentage of talented founders and senior managers of outstanding companies are Americans, many of them are still born and raised in immigrant families. The intelligence reserve is a significant factor of core competence for a nation. If we are thinking of this country's future, it is better to attract more smart, foreign students to work and live in United States.\n\nMany Americans are concerned, about the competition of foreign workers brings to local job market. I would like to say, based on my own experience in job seeking, foreign students confront much more restriction and limitation. When applying for technical roles, we face a much higher hiring bar. Almost all tech-related jobs that are filled by foreign students are because of the real need in the market that can not be filled with local students. As an example of IT industry, Facebook, Google, Apple, Uber all have launched recruitment in China and India, giving direct sponsorship for selected employee in those countries. Sponsorship is not cheap, companies are willing to pay more, simply because the companies believe those employees are smarter, deliver better work and better fit for the opportunities and roles. We are not simply taking the jobs away, we are creating jobs and making a better future.\n\nThe need is there, and we need to solve it. That is why we need the OPT extension.\n\nIt is true that there are some companies that targeting the current loopholes and filing more H1b applications for oversea workers, paying them at a low wage. American people blame them for taking jobs away. Yes but that is totally different from the OPT extension we are discussing. Realistically, if OPT extension is revoked, tens of thousands of foreign employees will be forced to leave after just a year of their starting date, and companies are forced to launch new recruiting process. This brings economic harm to those companies. More adversely, those companies will hesitate when they hire foreign new-grads next time. But since the need is still there, there will still be gap of smart workers in STEM fields. \n\nI watched the republican presidential candidate debate not too long ago. One of them raised a point which I can't agree more. \"Ironically, America might be the only country which it is controversial to say 'secure the border'.\" In my opinion, what is more ironic is that America is friendly to those undocumented immigrants with no jobs or low-end jobs, but is taking away STEM-related workers who are not only decent tax payers, but also real future value creators for the country.\n\nTherefore, for the bright future, and for the justice and equal opportunity of all people in this country, please pass the OPT-extension rule!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jiaju Shen, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2142", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM OPT extension rule will greatly benefit US economy as well as higher educational institutions in the United States.

Not \"American dream for everyone\" ideology stuff, but more about your interest and this nation's interest.\n\nIt's surprising how strong Americans are against this STEM OPT extension. The reason US is giving foreign students more working opportunities is that there are simply insufficient high-educated American citizens in STEM fields. As a doctoral student in Electrical Engineering, I think nothing is more persuasive than data. Let's look at the tip of the iceberg here.\n\nIn a 2013 report, it is pointed out that there are too few Americans in STEM field (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/12/new-report-shows-dependence-us-graduate-programs-foreign-students):\n\"foreign students make up the majority of enrollments in U.S. graduate programs in many STEM fields, accounting for 70.3 percent of all full-time graduate students in electrical engineering, 63.2 percent in computer science, 60.4 percent in industrial engineering, and more than 50 percent in chemical, materials and mechanical engineering, as well as in economics (a non-STEM field). \" \n\"For example, there are 36 graduate programs in electrical engineering where the proportion of international students exceeds 80 percent, including seven where it exceeds 90. (The analysis is limited to those programs with at least 30 full-time students.)\"\n\n\nIn my university (ranks 30th in electrical engineering), there are so few American students in the graduate school. In the whole floor where my lab is, there are literally only ONE American student pursuing a graduate degree (out of about 40 students in total). With such little supply of highly-educated American students, just imagine how much tech-companies will suffer if they are not allowed to hire foreigners. So it's actually your call: would you prefer using a slower iphone, less reliable car, more expensive computers, or would you prefer letting foreigners work in the US?

Extending the OPT for STEM students not only benefits these international students but also benefits the people here and the development of the country and economic. \nTechnology is the main trend of the development. There are lots of demands for STEM major jobs/positions in the market. This rule creates the supplement for this demand, and benefits the development of the economic. There will be certainly damages to many companies whose current employees are students and holding the OPT visa. Those employees are well educated after school, and well trained after one to two years intern in the company. They are talented, experienced workers, and ready to make their contributions to the company, but may have to leave the company and back to their countries if this rule doesn't pass. It's certainly a loss to these companies since it costs a lot to hire and train these people, and eventually would hurt the economic. \nI know many Americans worried about their job opportunities. They thought these students will take their jobs instead, but I don't think so. All of the companies are here for profits. Each jobs have requirements. It's not because they are STEM international students that the company hire them, it's because they are the right people who fits the positions well. Those students here are only making the job market more competitive, and competition only generates good results, like higher standards, more productive, and etc. If you can't take the job, no matter you are Americans or international students, it's not about the legal status, it's because you are not good enough for this position. Even though this rule passed, if the international students can't find the jobs, they cannot stay. \nThirdly, America is an immigration country. The culture is very diversified. The reason why America developed so rapidly in a short time is because the country is open to everyone, especially those talented people. If the people here worried about losing the jobs to these people, and turn them back, America will loss lots of talented persons/genius/engineers, etc, which is certainly not good for the development of the US.

We have world best quality universities and provide education to all smartest students in the world. If we let them stay to work several years after graduation, they could make more contribution to Unites States. Our country is strongest because of we have the best people- the most smart scientists, the most wisdom engineer, the best scholars in the world. This policy is attractive to these people to provide opportunity to make US stronger than forever. If OPT expansion was abandoned, these people would even not come to US. For example, the universities in France, England, German and other European countries could also provide world class education with far less tuition than US. We are giving other countries the opportunity to surpass America. Even though they decided to study in US for the quality education, without OPT expansion, they would still return to their own countries to let them start the business, lead research, contribute to their country. It would be a huge lose to America.       \n   \nSecondly, OPT expansion policy would also create more jobs, contribute to economy boom in US. On one hand, many of international students come to US to seek education. At the same time, they would also create incentive to different industry. If they are in US, whether in studying or OPT after graduation, they are buying US products everyday. They spend their money to their daily life. So they would bring more sale to supermarkets, malls, restaurants and other daily related industry. On the other hand, universities would also use international students intuition to support the research of professors. It is common that the intuition of international students is far more than our citizens. Besides, many international students also open their start ups with good ideas, recruiting more people in start up. For example, Nvidia, the largest manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the world, is created by a Taiwanese, named Jen-Hsun Huang.  The foundation of Nvidia is so profound since it without Nvidia no general purpose GPU, no advancement in deep learning - a revolutionary achievement in artificial intelligence, no modern video games with lavish visual effects but still running smoothly on your laptop, and our supercomputers would be hundreds of thousand times slower than what we actually have now. \n\nLastly, I know many of our citizens think OPT policy makes local American students more difficult to find a job. I believe they are very short-sighted and selfish. Do you think we have enough best engineer and scientists? Obviously not true. So many countries like India, China, UK, German want to spend large amount of money to attract them to make their contribution. But what are we doing? Trying to expel and restrict them. It does not make any sense.  \n\nIn summary, the OPT expansion policy would definitely be beneficial to our great country, United States. We use our best quality education and good policy- OPT expansion to attract world best people to US, let them make contribution to the prosperity of USA.

Foreign students have always been an important workforce for the United States. These STEM students serve in high-tech companies, research institutes, universities, which support the rapid growth of the United States. For decades, United States are taking advantages of this work force, thus it is wise to provide these foreign students proper opportunities for them to work in the United States, such as a 24-month OPT-extension.\nFor centuries, United States is the country of freedom and equality, and the door is always open. Taking a look at Japan, the locked door prevent the country from being improving, no matter how many efforts have been addressed in education, economics, and other factors. The world economy is in recession, and it is just not the correct time to shut the doors to foreign students. These students contribute $21.8 billion in tuition and $12.8 billion in other spending, and working opportunities should be considered another benefits for the United States. The 24-month extention is reasonable that they could contribute a lot to the country. \nWhat's more important, we should clarify that F-1 students are not immigrants. They come from fast growing countries which have a large market, and in return they are influencing their own country in an American way. Many comments seem to relate foreign students to immigrants, which is absurd. The limit of H1B lottery is 66,000 per year, and the bridge between OPT and H1B for foreign students is pretty huge. The H1B quota is where potential immigrants are regulated, not the OPT side. One-year is not even enough for a native student to find a job, how can this period be sufficient for OPT foreign students to find a job and do its contribution.\nTo sum up, the action is a wise and economical way for the U.S. government to take use of these foreign students. We should clearly differentiate them from immigrants, and realize that they are only graduated students. And opportunities should be given to them to have a job for a few years in the United States.

There is a shortage of STEM workers in the U.S. which can only be alleviated through foreign workers. This is absolutely not true. According to Joe Cunningham of Red State, \"One of the big education pushes in the United States is to increase STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education and create a workforce better suited to the jobs available in the modern era. Even schools that are not dedicated STEM schools are pushed to increase their STEM education, and other communities have gotten together to create STEM initiatives to supplement education.\" We have students and the resources to get our workforce interested in STEM but because of disingenuous policies like OPT and greedy tech corporations, U.S. workers are not even given a chance. In fact, because of these shady practices that only serve to benefit the tech corporations, it has hurt and discouraged students, particularly African Americans, from picking STEM fields. Richard Trumpka, the President of the AFL-CIO, stated that  \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%\". If this administration is for uplifting our minority groups and providing a better economic future for Americans, why is this administration pushing for an expansion of the OPT program which undoubtedly benefits foreigners while hurting and taking away opportunities for Americans?\n\n2. Students need three years of OPT, a \"so-called\" internship, to be prepared for a career in IT. I studied Management Information Systems at college and I can tell you that because it was a high quality program, I and my peers needed at most ONE SUMMER of internship experience to start our careers in IT. Why is it that foreign workers need THREE YEARS worth of experience to end up in the same position as me? Is it because they aren't actually qualified? Ron Hira of Howard University said the following, \"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition\". Speaking as someone who studied STEM and works in the field, it truly does not make any sense that someone so qualified would need three years to work as an intern to get their foot in the IT door. Professionally, I think many foreign workers are unqualified for IT positions. I have worked with several of these foreign IT workers and have seen that they often fabricate the level of experience they have along with their skills. Norm Matloff of UC Davis agrees with me, \"On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers\". So why not hire an American worker who is qualified on day one instead of a foreign national who is probably unqualified and apparently needs THREE YEARS to catch up? Or if the job does require extensive training, \"why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\". I believe it is because of the monetary perks gained by tech companies who hire through the F1 visa OTP pipeline. The government has created incentives which discriminate against IT workers whose national origin is the U.S.; its own people. 3. Money, in the form of billions of dollars, specifically designated for Social Security and Medicare should be stolen from their intended purpose to fund a program which ultimately takes away jobs from U.S. workers and discourages our youth from taking on STEM education and careers. How is it fair that I have to pay Social Security and Medicare from my paycheck when there is a whole class of foreign workers and tech companies who do not? I, and others like me, are being punished for being U.S. tech workers not only by NOT getting selected for positions but also, if we do find an IT job, are forced to pay taxes. Our companies who chose to hire us are being punished for picking us instead of foreign workers. How is that fair? Why is there even an incentive like this? This not only hurts U.S. workers but also takes from the social net we provide for our elderly and sick. According to David North from the U.S. Labor Department, \"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly\". Expanding the OTP program will only further erode the U.S. IT salary, further enforce discriminatory tactics, and hurt our society's most vulnerable; the elderly, sick, minorities, and youth.

Actually, for a long time, OPT program is one of the most attractive factor for international students to choose to study in America. They would get the leading education in school and more importantly, better training after graduate. International students who would benefits from OPT are those with high level of degrees and would promote the economic and competitive power of United States. And it is not deniable that some of the foreigners create the job opportunities for Americans. \n\nDHS continues to believe that the E-Verify program is an important measure to ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. The E-Verify program is an Internet-based service operated by USCIS, in partnership with the Social Security Administration (SSA). E-Verify is currently free to employers and is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. E-Verify electronically compares information contained on the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 (herein Form I-9) with records contained in government databases to help employers verify the identity and employment eligibility of newly-hired employees. This program currently is the best means available for employers to determine employment eligibility of new hires and, in some cases, existing employees.\n\nBefore an employer can participate in the E-Verify program, the employer must enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHS and SSA. This memorandum requires employers to agree to abide by current legal hiring procedures and to follow required procedures in the E-Verify process to ensure that E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. Violation of the terms of this agreement by the employer is grounds for immediate termination of its participation in the program. [53]\n\nAny employer wishing to hire a student participating in the STEM OPT extension would, as part of a newly required Mentoring and Training Plan, be required to sign a sworn attestation affirming that, among other things:\n(1) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; \n(2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and \n(3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives. \n\nAs with all affirmations contained in the Mentoring and Training Plan, the employer would attest that these commitments are true and correct to the best of the employer's knowledge, information and belief. If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers, the employer would be required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment. \n\nThere is no worry that international students/foreigners would \"steal the Americans' job\". OPT extension rule does more good than harm to United States, in economic, culture, future competitive, etc. \n\nI would definitely support this new rule. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cucheng Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19468", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The students with STEM degrees are invaluable assets to US.

Moreover, those international students are also continuingly making great contributions after their graduation. Many of them also joined many startups which increase a great deal of job positions for the local people. Without such opportunities for those international students, I don't think the number of international students will stay the same in future. In other words, this country will definitely lose a great number of its own economy contributors.\nFurthermore, some people fear that international students will make the job competition more fierce in the future. However, I do believe that it is the competition that makes this country prosperous as she is today. Competition is the key reason that makes an elite a elite. We can never lock ourselves up just because of the competition. This is the worldwide trend. We have to alert our children and help them to be more competitive in the future. Only in this way can our children learn how to work hard and enjoy the happiness that they fight for.\n\nFinally, I think some people who quote the so-called \"protection for citizens\" are just making nonsense.

International students with high education in STEM area are needed by universities and companies, and longer legal working period benefits the employers. I am currently in Mechanical Engineering department in university. Based on what I see, there are only a small percentage of native American graduate students choose engineering as their majors. Only several of them are doing thesis. Most of the thesis students are international. Furthermore, I did not see a native American post-doctors in Mechanical Engineering department. Therefore, native students in engineering area are not sufficient. The academic area is supported by international students. Based on what I heard, the companies in STEM area has the similar situation that a big portion of engineers are international. International students are needed! Then we have to think about if 12 month of OPT is long enough for these students. Based on what I see, a lot of projects requires more than one year to finish including some projects that proposed to be done within a year. In this case, it will be convenient for the employers if the student is able to stay for more than a year.\n\n2. A large portion of the income of universities is from international students, and a longer OPT attracts more international students to come to USA for education. The university charges three times of tuition to International students. International and native students obtain the same education while paying differently. Native students actually benefit from international students. The OPT policy is not only a sign of welcome to international students. It is also part of the education. Working experience in USA benefits the future career of the international students. Therefore, OPT extension represents the high level of education of USA.\n\n3. Some people are afraid that international students take the opportunities of native students. However, we have to notice that how many international students can finally stay depends on the H1 visa but not the OPT! Secondly, native citizens have a low preference to choose STEM area as their career as mentioned before, and it is easier for them to get a job than international students. Most job opportunities are marked \"citizen only\" if native employees are sufficient. International students only take the opportunities that the native students have no interest in.\n\n4. Pushing the people with high level of education to leave USA does not benefit the country. OPT extension is issued to the students with high education in STEM area. Most of them are in the age between 22 to 35, which is the period that they are creative and full of energy. During the OPT period, what they do is to make contribution to the society but not to consume resources.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Feifei Jiang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20051", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Comparing to Canada's policy towards international students, they grant them a 3-year work permit right after graduation!

This proposal is certain to harm American technology workers. At a time when many American students are drowning in college debt and unable to get jobs in their fields, the US Government has no business expanding visas for foreign tech workers. Furthermore, these workers will have an unfair advantage over their American competition: Because they are technically students, their employers will not have to pay payroll taxes for them, saving the employers about $10,000 per worker for each of the three years they are in the OPT program. At the same time, because their student visas will be tied to their employers, these young workers will be open to exploitation.\nIn its initial attempt to expand OPT, DHS admitted that the extension was indeed an attempt to circumvent the caps on H-1B visas.\nNot only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their student visas will be tied to their employers). Further, because these workers are still technically students, they wont have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years theyre in the program. \n\nBefore this rule is approved, DHS should have to answer these questions: How many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers? How many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field? How the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment?\nBetween 2008 and 2012, technology companies spent close to $1.5 billion lobbying the White House and members of Congress on the immigration issue. As labor economist George Borjas writes, corporate lobbying on immigration should be the best piece of evidence needed to show that wages drop when immigration rises. As he says, why would employers tend to go to Washington and expend their resources lobbying for something that doesnt benefit them?\n\nI am a self-employed computer programmer and the mother of a college student.

I really couldn't understand why would they think like that and what makes them feel kicking foreign students out will help them get the job. In my interviewing experience, actually international students are at a disadvantage at the beginning because of their identity and language barrier. They have to work ten times harder and have strong technical skill in order to stand out in the competition. I think that those who couldn't find a job should work harder and learn more instead of trying to kick foreign students out of the country. \nActually, I think it's competition that motivates people to work harder and contribute more to the who society. In addition, to those who complain about that some international employees take low wages, I just want to say, first many firms have global pay, and even if this is the case, it contributes to the low living cost. \n\nMoreover, I think this proposal is good because diversity is important. Think about how much international students contributed to the diversity of US society. They bring to the US food, music, art, culture, and so on. These diversity greatly improved the living standards of US people.\n\nLast but not least, international students contributed greatly to the economy of US. Many labs and employers choose international employees for their solid technical skills and diligence. International students have played a great role in the development of technology. \n\nTo sum up, I strongly support this proposal and it will be a great loss for US economy if it stops the opt extension, because one of the key strength of US is the talented people from all over the world.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rongxin  Yu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11386", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It cannot be more obvious that Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities will be beneficial to U.S. economy.

I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.\n\nI thank for the opportunity give to me to comment on this proposed rule.\n \nSincerely,\n \nBadrinath Bhalkiker\nState University of New York at Binghamton\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Badrinath Bhalkiker", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11035", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I absolutely support the OPT expanding, which definitely benefit the American government and all american people. All the F1 student are studying and working very hard more than 20 years and what they only want to apply their knowledge into real applications, which of course in return brings great influence to United State. \n\nAs we all know, united state is composed with all immigrants. because of our coverage and Harding working, United state became the best country in the world. however, few people are getting lazy and do not want study and improve themselves. they only want ask help and money from the government and tax-payers and they also extremely wrongly ask the government preventing all incoming new F1 opportunities. \n\nNumerous international students do lots of contribution to this country and they also pay tax to perform their responsibility. to view a big picture, we have to provide more opportunities to these smart, working-hard F-1 student, and let them compete with each other. Then we picked the best of them to work for our country, so United state could be the best advanced country forever, and our children will also have a good life because of our decision.

I am totally SUPPORT this proposed regulation because: it could increase the chance of obtaining the H1-b working visa especially when nowadays the applications are skyrocketing as time goes, so that they (including myself) would not have to leave U.S. due to the lack of legal visa.\n\nIn addition to that, I'd like to share my two thoughts/suggestions:\n\n1. Establish a scoring immigration system: it would be lose-lose when an outstanding student/engineer/scientist has to leave U.S. since he/she were not \"lucky\" enough to obtain a H1-b working visa. This kind of case is absolutely not a good case for the economy growth/development of United States. Besides, the reason why H1-b visa exists is because United States government wants to have the better/best people stay and work for U.S.. And thanks to, if any, the scoring immigration system, people who wants to obtain the visa or green card would like to improve him/herself so that they won't be eliminated out, namely enhance the competition effect. Granted that EB1 visa has already covered some of the elites, there would still be a lot of great people who are definitely worthy of a legal visa to stay and work for U.S.. I am pretty sure I am not the first one to propose this scoring system, but please re-consider it, if possible. It will be win-win for both foreign employees and the country of United States.\n\n2. Increase the frequency of drawing applications to H1-b slots from \"once per year\" (on April 1st each year) to \"twice per year\" (April 1st and October 1st each year): currently, applications could only get one chance (or two chance if he/she has a higher level degree) to be drawn from the application pool each year. In fact, most of the students would graduate at the end of spring quarter or spring semester, who would have to wait till April next year to be able to submit the application. And if it didn't work out, he/she would have to wait a whole year to try it again, which may not be applicable if he/she don't have enough OPT time left.\n\nI appreciate this opportunity to speak my thoughts loud.

The idea of Optional Practical Training is to provide an opportunity to the students from various countries, who come to U.S. for education, to have practical experience in the United States before they go back to serve their home counties. The period of 1 year seems to be appropriate for \"practical training\" in any field. \n\nI have never been a fan of STEM extensions. The fact that DHS distinguishes between the STEM and non-STEM students in fixing the allowed duration for OPT may be due to one of the following two reasons:\n\n1. Either the DHS, at an institutional level, believes that STEM fields are so superior and highly specialized than other fields like law, humanities, journalism etc, that they require up to 3 year just to provide training for the work; or\n\n2. DHS is using STEM OPT just as a disguise to provide work authorization to the \"TECHIES\" from countries like India and China. It is also to give them more chances to try their luck in H-1B lotteries.\n\nIf you try and contact the largest companies in the STEM field, none of them will have such enormous and extravagant training programs which last for three long years. Most training programs last for a maximum of 6 months. Given the facts that the students are from an alien country, even 1 year seems to be apt. \n\nTherefore, I can't seem to understand the need for STEM extension either for 17 or 24 months.

Welfare? Homelessness? Loan defaults? Increased civil unrest? As always, our society will end up footing the bill. How many different ways are we going to have to pay for this stupidity?\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department stated about the OPT:\n\n    \"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with \n     students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n    \"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college \n     grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n    \"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under \n     payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n    \"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now \n    worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card \n    or citizen graduate.\"\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa stated in a letter to President Obama:\n\n    \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same \n    amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively \n    established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\n    \"The proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n    report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the \n    Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands \n    of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students \n    working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals \n    until the program was secured and students could be located.\" \n\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to \n     hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nHow \"temporary\" is temporary for a fake, unnecessary training program? This sounds just like the proverbial \"temporary tax\" that never goes away.\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis and Ian Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute also see some of the inherent dangers, and irresponsible administration of this program. Professor Matloff stated:\n\n    On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\n    Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nFrom Ian Smith:\n\n    \"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the      middle class.\"\n    \"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\n    \"DHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n    \"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits \n    will be young and therefore cheap...\"\n    \"Because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\nSchools get tax dollars to train people for jobs they won't receive, while loaning them thousands of dollars they'll never be able to pay back.

However, I really believe that STEM OPT is good for the US. I lived in US for more than 7 years and got two degrees, here is my second home. I love USA and American people. If US government paid more than 200000 USD for me to get my graduate degree and then send me back home, that is not a wise choice. Because what we want is just working for some of the world's best companies and bring happiness to our families, the US, and the American people.

With my knowledge in statistics, data analytics, modeling and finance, I work with my team to develop models to manage credit risk of Wells Fargos portfolios, as well as contribute to the financial stability of the U.S. economy.\n\n \nThe recent decision by U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelleon (D.C.) has eliminated the OPT STEM extension, which means if no new rules take effect, my employer will have to terminate employment relationship with me. I was glad to see the proposed new rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, Cap-Gap relief and an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. \n\n\nThe proposed rule will help to provide valuable educational training for international students, thus making the higher education more practical and helpful. Take myself as an example, at Stanford, I took several courses related to data analytics and finance, where I had the chance to acquire cutting edge knowledge from the world class faculty. While my training experience under OPT at Wells Fargo has provided me a deeper understanding and hands-on experience of how modelling techniques and data analytics can be used in the real banking industry, especially in the credit risk area to protect our customers financial safety, and the stability of the company, or even the U.S. economy. With expanded OPT STEM, we can have more opportunity to integrate the theory learned in school with practical experience in the industry in professional settings. Credit risk management is such a huge system (after working for 18 months, I have to admit I only reached a corner of the Basel modeling, a regulatory part of credit risk) that longer training means a thorough understanding of the area. Without doubt, this will help international STEM students to develop their skills in a well-rounded way. Also, I believe the Theory + Practical training model of education will become a great advantage of higher education system in the U.S., making a contribution to the technology advancement in the U.S.   \n\n\nSecond, my employer also benefits from OPT STEM new rules. After the financial crisis in 2008, banks learned that it is their highest priority to manage risk. Government and regulators also put a lot of new strict rules to regulate the financial industry.  As banks put more and more resources in risk management and per regulators requirements, talents with knowledge of statistics and mathematical modelling in banking are in high demand. So there is a shortage of such talents who can help banks to predict their default rate, to conduct stress tests to comply with new regulations, to monitor and management risk dynamically and etc.  My work here supports my employers responsibilities for customers and help to make Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in the country, to manage risk with the cutting-edge quantitative tools in order to perform stably. \n\n\n\nThird, OPT does not harm job opportunities for U.S. citizens. My employer filed Labor Condition Application (LCA) for me this year in order to file H-1B petition. The LCA showed that my salary is higher than the prevailing wage of similar positions in my area. This means the OPT program did not lower the wage level for U.S. citizens. And Im glad that the proposed new rule strengthens the salary requirement and companys qualification. I strongly support these new regulations.  Besides that, I also helped my employer to train new hires with my knowledge in programming and analytics, to help them gain technical and professional skills quickly. Among the four new hires I helped with, three are U.S. citizens and one is U.S. permanent resident. Im more than happy to share my knowledge and experience with American colleagues in training sessions, answering their questions whenever they have, and help the whole team to be excellent. Im NOT hired to replace my American colleagues; nor to be a threat to them. \n\nTo sum up, the OPT STEM Extension is an advantage of U.S. higher education which help international students gain hands-on experience; it also help the employers to narrow the talent gap in STEM field; and it does not bring harm to U.S. citizens if strict salary requirement and employer qualification are implemented.   With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n      \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chuanqi Wei", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7540", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT extension is a very good part after the US study, and it has big influence on the US companies.

International students pay high tuition and fees, bear high living expenses (compared to the countries they come from), and contribute to the economy by paying indirect and direct taxes. The degrees without professional experience won't add any value if they go back to their own country. Also, if the government puts a ban on students' working, the rate of students coming for higher studies would drop significantly affecting the companies and economy.

It will boost US economy. Some of the opponents' comments are very ridiculous. In this comment, I want to prove their comments are deadly wrong.\n\n1. Some of the opponents claim OPT students don't pay Social Security and Medicare. That depends. NOT ALL students are exempt from Social Security&Medicare. Whether companies have to pay the Social Security&Medicare depends on whether the worker is Resident Alien OR Non-Resident Alien. Resident Aliens have to pay Social Security&Medicare while Non-Resident Aliens don't have to. To be qualified for Resident Alien, one must pass Either Green Card Test OR Substantial Presence Test. The first test is easy to understand. To pass the second one, the # of days he stays in US in this year + the # of days he stays in US in last year / 3 + the # of days he stays in US in the year before last year / 6 must >= 180 days. So for H1B workers, almost all of them have to pay Social Security. But for F1 student, there is a 5-year exemption period, which means the first 5 years he stays in US on F1 visa don't count into Substantial Presence Test. From the 6th year, F1 student will become Resident Alien and have to pay Social Security&Medicare, too. This 5-years exemption period includes BOTH the time they study in universities AND the time they work on OPT. So for example, if one student spends 4 years pursuing a Bachelor degree, then he is exempt from SS&Medi for ONLY ONE year on OPT. He also has to pay SS&Medi from the 2nd year. If one student spends 2 years pursuing a Master degree, then he is exempt from SS&Medi for 3 years on OPT. If one student get both a Bachelor and Master from a US university, then he will NOT be able to be exempt from SS&Medi because 5 years have already passed before he can graduate. This exemption period is applicable to F1 student ONLY, NOT H1B workers. Although F1 student may be exempt from SS&Medi, but they are NOT qualified for Standard Deduction or American Opportunity and Life-time Learning Credits (Form-8863). The former one is $6300 for the year 2015 and the latter one is $1000-$2500. Besides, F1 student is NOT qualified for any benefits brought about by SS&Medi. So the status of Non-Resident Alien BOTH reduces the tax on SS&Medi AND increases the tax on Standard Deduction and AOLLC(Form-8863).\n\n2. Some of them claim OPT students' wage is lower so employers use cheap labor to replace US workers. It's deadly WRONG, too. This year Facebook offers 115K base salary + 10% bonus + 160K RSU + 75K sign-on bonus for Foreign New Graduate working on OPT. This is for OPT students who just come out of universities, NOT those with years' experience. I don't know the package for US citizens. I googled it and I find it seems the salary for US citizens who just graduate from universities is the same. So Facebook did NOT use cheap OPT students because they are NOT cheap.\n\n3. Some opponents claim US employers favor foreign labors. It's wrong, too. I agree with you that US citizens should be given priority in job market, BUT I do NOT agree with the statement that US companies are using foreign workers to replace US workers. Based on my observation, only a very small number of US companies use cheap foreign workers to replace US workers. Most companies are already giving priority to US workers now and only use foreign workers as a complement. For example, Epic Systems, in Wisconsin. Last years, Epic hires tens of foreign workers because it was expanding fast. However, in this year, the number of empty positions shrinks significantly. Under such circumstances, Epic modified its official websites, stating that in this year, they only accept US workers, NOT even a single foreign workers. It means that Epic hires foreign workers only when there are large number of positions. If there aren't many positions, then positions are only given to US workers. I think it's a very good sign, which means US companies are doing what should be done and foreign workers are NOT replacing US workers in most companies.\n\n4. Some people always use the example of Disney. I searched on the Internet and I find Disney is NOT an e-verified company. It has NOTHING to do with OPT extension.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\"\n\n- \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located.

Keepingimmigrants with STEM degrees in the United States will allow them to continueto contribute to the highly profitable leading tech industrywithin the United States. We all know that every country has a very limitednumber of highly talented people. Deporting a huge number of highly talented people from the United Statesafter their OPTs expire will definitely harm various American STEM industries,for reasons that:\n\n      a.   Employerswill lose very talented STEM employees previously in OPT status that employers haveinvested a substantial amount of money and labor to hire.\n      b.   Employerswill need to invest another substantial amount of money and labor to hirepeople to fill vacancies created by departing OPT employees. This will havedirect negative impact to both the employers budget and project/producttimelines since the employers will need to spend time and money on the newemployees training/onboarding process.\n      c.    Wecan NOT assume that there are enough qualified American employees to fill thevacancies created by departing OPT employees. As a result, we can NOT assumethere are enough qualified American STEM workers to supply the huge demand of STEM hiring market.\n\n2.    STEM immigrants have to rent a home and purchase goods. For example, mylandlord is an American and I pay over one thousand dollars to him each monthfor the rent. I also spend thousands of dollars on food, travelling, gasolineand insurances each month. All those moneys are paid directly to American industries,American businesses, or American individuals, which will have a direct positiveimpact to the American people and economy.\n. visit 1point3acres.com for more.\n3.    For those who are not supporting this proposal, they are myopic, thatis, they do not see the profits that STEM immigrants brought to the American STEMindustries in the past years.\n\n4.    Not having an OPT extension will give STEM immigrants much feweropportunities to obtain a work visa or even a green card, and that will have a terribleimpact on the American economy, starting from American universities. As we allknow, international students within the United States pay much higher tuitionfees while unable to receive any financial aids from the US government, and thenumber of international students at American colleges have increased dramaticallyover the past few years. The extra tuition fees paid by international students increaseuniversity budgets, which directly benefits both American universities andAmerican students. When international students realize that they may have amuch less opportunity to stay in the United States after they graduate, theymay choose another country which provides a better immigration policy to starttheir college and/or future career. Losing international students will increasethe budget burden of American public universities and thus require more fundsfrom state governments to support the normal operation of U.S. publicuniversities. Likewise, less people will rent American homes and the rent willgo down, which may lead some American families whose income are mainly fromcollecting rent from students and STEM immigrants into bankruptcy.\n\nInconclusion, the advantages of extending OPT of STEM students by an extra 24months far outweigh the disadvantages.

It is the diverse and delicate environment that attracts thousands and thousands of talents to this country and willingly devote their time and effort in pursuing what they are passionate about. In this world with only more and more competition, the 24 months OPT extension amendment is progress. The OPT extension is reasonably well-positioned in further improving the diversity of the society and make sure it remains competitive. \n\nSecond, OPT extension is necessary for students to leverage on what they have learned into real work experience and contribute to the society. From a rather realistic point of view, to apply is the aim to learn. And students with degree from US colleges or universities are eager for opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills in the areas that they have been studying for all these years. The extension is an ideal chance for them to gain crucial work, research or any other professional experience. It would not be fair to say that the sole purpose of education is about application,  because education, in its broader sense includes all activities designed so as to influence the way of thinking. For students with degrees in STEM, the OPT and extension period is an important value-adding opportunity for them. And for employers, it is to their benefits to have more young people join them and grow with them. This is indeed a win-win situation. \n\nThird, educational institutions will benefit from OPT extension amendment. Educational institutions have been benefit from the OPT extensions through these years, and it will only benefit more from the 24-months amendment. As the OPT and extension provide students with one more reason to apply for schools in United States, extension amendment will incentivize an increasing number of students to consider schools and colleges in United States as their priority when think about study abroad. \n\nTo sum up, there are many more reasons supporting the STEM OPT extension amendment.

I have been working since then in Yahoo as a software engineer on OPT/OPT STEM. To be honest I was really sad at first seeing the recent court ruling, which would terminate OPT STEM program if a new rule could not be established in place before the designated date in February 2016. I will have to leave the United States by then as the next H-1B filing will not happen until April 2016. It was hard for me to accept since I have been doing really well in Yahoo since the beginning of my career and have always been a top performer/contributor. This is also too soon to terminate my OPT training as I still have a lot to learn and convert what I have learned in my graduate program into my job. Therefore I am really glad to see that a new rule is proposed in such a short notice, and I wholeheartedly support this rule and honestly believe that this rule will bring benefits to STEM students as well as the U.S. economy.\n\n1. The OPT STEM Rule Benefits both STEM Students and the U.S. Economy\n\nTo be honest, I think the OPT/OPT STEM rule are the leading reasons that so many international students choose to pursue their education in the U.S. This rule allows students to apply what they have learned in practice/industry, which really helps students to get the gist of how things works in real life and how they can contribute to the society with their expertise. This way, international students will be able to use their talents to help U.S. companies grow and thrive. As I know, most international students, especially students from China are the best of the best, and I believe that they will make great contribution to the nation through the OPT/OPT STEM program. Without OPT/OPT STEM program, most international students would have to leave the country after they graduate, and what they have learned in the U.S. may not comply with the industry in their own countries, therefore leading to a waste of educational resources. Besides, a lot of international students may not choose to study in the U.S. without the OPT/OPT STEM program because they see no future for them after graduating. They would also feel that the United States is not welcoming them wholeheartedly thus not choosing to study in the U.S. This would cause a great loss in tuition/taxes income as well as the potential contribution international students could have made. For example, immigrants are among the cofounders of many top tech companies such as Google, Tesla Motors and even SpaceX. These are the companies that are really leading us to the future. The United States stays competitive in the world, partly due to its leading tech industry and international students are really a important part in these high-tech companies.\n\n2. The OPT STEM Extension should be 24 Months\n\nIt typically takes at least 3-4 years to master a skill, since the purpose of OPT is to put what students learned from academy to research/industry practice, I would say that OPT STEM combined with the initial OPT which adds up to 36 months would be sufficient for a true \"practical training\".\nBesides, many international students would like to have a real career by pursuing their higher education in the U.S., which in most cases is through H-1B visa. However, due to the increasing demand for H-1B visas in the recent years, even applicants with advanced STEM degrees have quite small chance of winning the H-1B lottery. For example, my wife and I have been filing H-1B petition for the past 2 years and still neither of us can get it, and having a longer gap-gap relief brought by the OPT STEM would definitely give more chance for STEM students/employees like us. Without a clear plan for our future, knowing that we have high possibility of getting a stable status would waste our energy which could have been put into making more contributions to the company into worrying about these kind of issues.\n\n3. Options to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted 17-Month Extension\n\nI think that students who have already been granted 17-month extension and those who are eligible to file an extension before the ruled terminating date in Jan 2016 should be able to continue working till the expired date on their EAD cards, even if the new OPT STEM rule cannot get through in time. I believe so not only because in my own case, my wife and I have already been granted 17-month extension, but also that these students get their extension while the rule is still in place and effective. They should not be paying for the huge cost of this decision simply because of the rule does not pass in time, and it is not even their fault. Most of them have already made a lot of plans based on their extension end date, and it is not fair to say at the least to let them endure the loss.\n\nSincerely yours,\nSusen", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Susen Zhao", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18397", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "American economy, especially in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mechanics, is driven by lots of immigrants.

Please read the reasons why I think so:\n\nFirst of all, the United States can not, and should not forget that numerous breakthrough and innovations in its past were the effort of the exceptional immigrants. The United States is a country built on immigration and integration of the world. The government should recognize that crucial component of the society and be wise in providing international students who are educated in the U.S. opportunities to contribute to the country.\n\nSecond, it is self-evident that most of these international students who would apply for STEM OPT are NOT the ones who cannot survive in their own respective countries. They could get a good job there, as well, but for reasons that include (but not limited to) a better living environment, a more equal society, seeking adventure in life, etc., they prefer to stay in the U.S. and get a job. If the students graduated from U.S. higher education institutions were no better than average American citizens, WHY THEN would we see American companies willing to hire them? \n\nFor an American company or employer, the hiring process of an international student requires more complicated logistics than that of an American citizen. But the reason the employer still chooses to hire the international person is that the international person is more competent. He or she holds certain skills, certain knowledge, or capabilities that NO OTHER AMERICAN could equal. That is the sole reason I can find that explains why international graduates are hired. They fill the positions that Americans cannot fill.\n\nThird, it is AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION of the United States to discriminate according to a person's race, ethnicity, nationality background, or gender. Although it is a sad fact that in the present society such retrograde, despicable discrimination still exists, at least we should take action in legislature to prevent it. It had been ethical in America's history, it is unethical right now, and it will NEVER be ethical to create more instruments for discrimination and inequality. It cannot be more humiliating to the Constitution to raise flags for laws that promote the reduction of equality. ALL MEN ARE BORN EQUAL. Americans, and international students are born equal. Both American students and international students deserve to live in a society where they are provided equal opportunities, and where they are judged by their merit, not by their skin color, or birth country.\n\nFourth, some opponents of the proposal argue that \"international students' presence intensifies competition for employment.\" And that, is based on the FALSE assumption that employers favor international graduates BECAUSE they are international. However, needless to say how prejudiced, immature, and just RIDICULOUS this point of view is. In reality, most of the employers set rules against the employment of international graduates, let alone favor them. In the small proportion of employers who don't set such rules, they select the most competent candidates. Employers' selection to hire somebody is based on their competence and merit, and if an American individual meets the expectation, this individual is hired. If there are an American individual and an international individual competing for the same position, the employer will pick the MORE competent. And as the employer gets an opportunity to hire that more competent one, the society on a macro-scale benefits, compared to the scenario where the employer ends up hiring the less competent one. American government, it is your time to think: do you prioritize the society's benefit, or do you prioritize a particular lost American individual's benefit?\n\nThe government should be wise to make the rational decision to approve the proposal for STEM OPT extension. The anti-immigrant advocates take a different stand, probably because they were the students who partied all the way through college, and ended up being mediocre citizens, and they say that they feel their chances (opportunities, resources, etc.) threatened because of the international graduates. They say that international students are perils of the American society, but may I ask you, have you ever heard elites like Sheryl Sandberg complain about their opportunities being robbed by international graduates? The international-threat-to-resources is just the opinion the losers hold.\n\nPlease take your time to think.

These skills, like Internet Security, Mechanical Engineering, Geographic Information Science and many others, are highly demanded skills in the current job market. In other words, the job market is in short supply of excellent candidates. By 2020, employment in all computer occupations is expected to increase by 22%, but some IT fields will fare better than others, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) biennial update of employment projections. Providing STEM students longer timeframe would gave them a better chance to fulfill these demands in the job market. As the companies could find better candidates, they would have more economic contribution to the nation and pay more tax.\n\nSTEM graduates, who turn from bachelor to master or PhD candidates, will increase the overall labor quality of the nation when they are entering the job market. A labor population with better quality is critical to a nations economic growth. People with little education could only work for some basic jobs, while people with high education could work in high-tech sectors. The nation definitely do not want the major industry be the agriculture and manufacturing. Services industry is what the US is wanted. It is a few pollution, high profit margin, sustainable and environmental friendly industry. STEM subjects are exactly parallel with the services industry. With STEM students have more time to be authorized to work in the service industry, the more the US economy would be benefited from the enhanced labor population. \n\nMore time for STEM students work for the America would also help US to enhance its worlds leader position. The country has been a leader in a lot of fields in the world, and many of them are exactly STEM subjects like IT, medicine, engineering and science. Let STEM students work for a longer time in these fields would bring more diversity to the working and researching environment, as well as efficiency and energy. No field would achieve success if no one succeed. With STEM students continuing to push human beings discovering the nature, building better infrastructure, more secure and efficient web environment, the country would be benefited from that, with a stable and unshakable position as the world leader.\n\nSomeone may think these STEM students are taking opportunities away from the current citizens. I do not agree with that. Opportunities are only available to those who are prepared, and they are not affected by others. This country is a place that everyone has equal rights. There is no affection for non-citizen at all in the job market. Provided two candidates have exactly the same knowledge, a citizen would definitely get the job compared with a STEM student because of the no cost in work authorization management. If a person loses or could not get his / her job, it is not caused by STEM students but he / she is not qualified. We should not blame personal disqualification to STEM students. The STEM extension will be a good example of the Immigration revolution of the Obama government, even though F-1 students are only a tiny part of non-immigration legal residence in the American land.\n\nIn conclusion, STEM students with 24 months extension would increase the average education level of the labor population, bring more knowledge and benefits to US companies and economy, and lead to a more stable world leader positon of the United States of America.\n\nGod blesses the America.\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, as a STEM student who just start to work under OPT, I found my value could be used for the people, the government in this country. As a contractor of the USDA, I used my GIS knowledge learned from my Master degree to help the agency. My job duty is to do Python scripting, Geoprocessing management, publishing geoprocessing models and maps. These products will be used within the different department of agency. Some of them are used by field operators to monitor the conservation of easement. Some of them would help the field to have a better and faster planning process. Of course, some of them are solely to make the current workflow more efficient within the agency. I felt that Im blessed to have a chance to use my professional knowledge learnt from my Master degree to help the conservation of natural lands. I do not want to lose this chance to better serve the people, the America if I have to go back to my home country as the H1-B visa is way too much hard to obtain.\n\nI fully SUPPORT DHS decision to give 24 moths extension of F-1 students. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Simon Suo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0157", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's absolutely good news to both USA and F1 students.

I take my 17-month STEM opportunity right now after my 1-year OPT period ended in June, 2015. Many of my friends are also benefied by OPT-extension as scientific researchers. Therefore, I highly support the STEM as a long-standing regulation for the future students in these areas in the United States for the reason as followed:\n\n1. STEM studies are hard and it takes more than one year of practice. This is a fact. It always requires years of training and long term practice even after school. For example, considering the major contributor of STEM research-the postdocs, many of them start their postdoc training using OPT. And, one year is not enough at all for many studies to finish, especially for the biomedical researches. There are other jobs, such as patent lawyers, counsalting, community college or high school teacher, proposal manager, facility manager and so on, all of them require many techiniques that can only be learnt as an entry level worker for more than a year. \n \n2. The job market, on the other hand, is not that easy correspondingly. I guess it is a nature for getting a tenure track faculty job as difficult as it should be, other company based scientist jobs are also becoming harder and harder to get based on my experience-considering the time it takes to prepare the job applicatioin, several rounds of interviews, and so on. Again, one year OPT does not provide any flexiblity for the highly educated students to realize the transition to fully prepared emplyees, not to mention that many International students have extra difficulties to find the company who would like to sponsor their H1B visa.   \n\nIn sum, I think that 24-month STEM can be a good opportunity for all the students who can learn in the US, can work for the US, and can fully contribute their values to the US.

Many of the students who has benefited from this action won't be able to contribute their knowledge to STEM fields in the long run without OPT extension, since they will have to leave the country soon after completion of their education. Projects in STEM usually takes more than 3 years to finish. For example, the average length of cycles in drug development is more than five years, and it takes 2-3 years to complete a software engineering project. Terminating OPT extension will cause a huge lose to the US, since it basically means the US wants to give up its investment on educating talents from the past and leave the benefits to their competitors. Many of the high-tech, pharmaceutical and business companies will suffer from this consequence. I don't see how this would help increase job opportunities for US citizens, since the US companies might gradually lose its competitiveness in the global market.  \n\nI can also foresee how terminating OPT extension could affect the education industry of the US, since such a policy would largely discourage students from pursuing higher education in the US. The number of international students in the US has been increasing over the years, and their educational expense has been a big source of funding to support the continuous development of American universities as well as creating more job opportunities for the natives. As one of those international students, I would have chosen to study and work for other countries if I knew I wouldn't have a good chance of getting further training opportunities for my career after graduation. Although temporarily there might seem to be less competition on the job market, the US companies would be paying more for missing the opportunities of recruiting people with STEM expertise in the long run. \n\nIt is also not true that OPT students have advantages in the hiring process because their wages are lower than US citizens. In fact, it is rather the opposite. The cost for hiring an international student is more than a citizen, due to the additional cost of applying proper work visa for international employees and the risk of losing the employee in the future due to their visa status. Therefore, OPT students who could get a job are those with special skills that are urgently needed by the companies, not those underpaid for their work.

It is the fact that there will always be the need of foreign skilled worker in an excellent company which couldn't be denied. In this way, without the extension, companies will need to spend more resources to train and employ new people, which will not only be harmful for a long term development, but also will it consume the benefits and salaries of current employees in this less meaningful way. The international students and local workers are in two relatively parallel competing fields, which means the numbers of one kind won't affect the other's because of different roles and jobs accordingly. But the input of training new people will influence the whole companies, and decreased cost brought by the extension can benefit all staffs consequently.\n\n2. The extension could give STEM students an option of working in the US for 3 years without consider whether staying, without apply for H1B options. It will decrease the salary gap between native workers and foreign workers, which will be more faire to all. \n\n3. Students studying in the US are usually supported by their families, and parents in China usually only have one child, so they are waiting their children coming back home after graduation rather than leaving them behind in China from then on. And the extension could fulfill the demands for students to work a little bit in th US as well as the parents' expectation of welcoming their sweethearts in just three years happily. \n\n4. As a common sense, people tend to stick with things that are hard to obtain. If staying working in the US for a while is not that difficult or full of luck (H1B), students will just go back home when 3 years are over.\n\n5. No need to mention how the increasing international students will bring a lot of money and jobs to the US.\n\n6. Personally, I will prefer to work in Shanghai, in China, rightly after my PHD, because there are people I love very much in China, and I don't want to keep them waiting for too long. This is not a special case, which indicate that even though there is such extension, there won't be a flood of international workers, because many of us care about families more than jobs, and won't use that extension at all in fact. Thus, the extension will just make employers in the US have a better day and bring a healthier working environment  to us all.\n\nThanks a lot. Wish this could be approved.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zihan Xu, UCSD", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12227", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:\n1.

Extending OPT gives more time for graduated students to gain the experience for his focused area is good for the clarification of one's own goal and how to make progress, which matches the idea of US education has proposed.\n\n2.More time for OPT also means more chance of diversity in an organization, which has been brought up so many times as a fact for the prosperity of such organization. If OPT were extended, international students would have less pressure or worries from the restriction of time they have been offered, and thus create more suitable environment for them to become more creative and innovative for the organization they are working with, which eventually with bring more good than harm to the industry.\n\n3.The extension is not that long to harm anything. As previously settled, a STEM student would have another 17-month OPT after the initial 12-month OPT expires. The proposal right now is only asking it to be extended from 17 to 24, so that in most cases, it is just used for covering the gap period if a valued employee is transferred from f1 to h1b. I doesn't change the fact that there is only one lottery for each year and about 80000 people to be selected to have their visa status changed.

The 2 year OPT extension may make a competitive job finding for the local people. However, the competition can give a positive effect to U.S. economics. We can see that the silicon valley took a significant position in U.S. GDP and the worldwide.

We breath the wind of freedom and hope that the new concept and culture from U.S. can be brought to the corner of the world.\n\n3. More foreign student can improve the diversity of U.S. Diversity is vital important especially in U.S. The culture difference make people more understanding each other and learn from each other of the superb culture.

Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\nThe proposed OPT rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT.

It was the immigrants! Students who come to the states pursuing higher degrees brought new blood to the country. However, they are taking back the advanced knowledge and ideas from the states to other countries if they are sent back immediately after graduation. Isn't it like gradually draining nutrition from a strong giant, which only creates danger of disease and even death! OPT and STEM OPT are here for students to apply the knowledge they learnt into making the country better.\n\nI can see most of the voice against this rule is concerning the foreigners are taking jobs from the Americans. Is it even true? I'd say NO! From my observation, 90% of my coworkers are American citizens. However, I feel we've been treated evenly. We get similar pay, equal opportunity of promotion and I might get fired if I was under qualified for the job. I never feel I get can a job more easily because I'm a foreigner.

As an international student, I expect to have meaningful period of training in industry. Concerning my major, computer science, I expect an at least 2 years training to get any useful experience. A short OPT will definitely change my decision on whether bother taking the OPT at all. Training opportunities are crucial for majors like computer science when choosing universities in different countries, and it's right now a definite advantage for all the universities in U.S.; without this main competitive strength, I suspect a huge drop in the number of international students. After all, there's a maximum number of months for OPT, the \"jobs\" taken by OPT as some of the other comments suggested are to be returned, but the potential huge drop of international students will be a great loss and hard to recover.\n\n2. OPT extension is not a threat for any qualified native workers at all. I cannot agree with some comments' exaggeration and providing non-general examples with no proof that OPT is the problem for somebody not getting a job. It's obvious that the number of students is limited and the time is limited. To whom thinking companies prefer workers in OPT, it's common sense that companies prefer stable workers rather than the new grads who are very likely to leave after a year or two. I cannot see any benefits taken from native workers at all. \n\n3. Taking away these opportunities from international students doesn't mean that they will necessarily go to those who complain about it. Competition is crucial for a company to stay alive and stay healthy, as a result, a company won't let unqualified people in and won't force qualified people out. Companies are trying to attract best people in field, the positions will just not exist if there are no people qualified for it.

I truly believe this is  a good regulation for the whole society. There are three reasons for my view. \n\nFirst, the United States needs talents in the STEM major students to make it a strong country. It is obvious how technology could have a huge impact on the economy. Nowadays, most top companies needs technology. Technology can help companies in so many different ways. Technology can make management much easier with ERP systems, make communication much easier with phones and emails, make decision much easier and wiser with data available to do analysis, let alone in most cases, technology has became the core competence for many companies. I truly believe it is very important for the United States to keep its leading role in technology and economy. To do that, the United States needs talents. \n\nSecond, the United States has a long immigration history, people from different cultures to work together to really think of good ideas, to work out really different problems is what makes the United States what it is today. I don't believe being harsh on the people that could really make a difference is a wise decision. \n\nThird, as this regulation mentioned, it would make the US university more competitive in the world. It is very important to have the best university in the world, because that is the future of the society. Having those talented people in the same place would achieve many meaningful goals, say having ground breaking research results in technology, medical, science, etc. This could really make the world a better place.\n\nIt is tough for those F1 students to find a job in the US. It is a highly competitive market, a low probability to find a job here, let alone stay in the US. However, if a talent is needed, is hired despite all the difficulty, I think it would be fair to let them spend the most precious time in their life in the United States, to work really hard, and truly make a difference.

The economy will face a significant hit if we don't have such incentives for international students and we will lose such brilliant minds to other countries.They also have to pay taxes both federal and state and that helps the government in their spending unlike illegal aliens who evade tax.\n3. They cannot be unemployed for more than 90 days in their OPT program. They can gain employment only related to their degree obtained here. This means they have to work extremely hard and gain employment and stay unemployed.

The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joyce & Jerry Hansen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8722", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally support f1 stem students..", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sai Kumar", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8803", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT extension is ABSOLUTELY needed.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mark Cummins", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10149", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly believe the rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gowtham Kumar", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0663", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We welcome this OPT extension for STEM international students.

A comprehensive and advanced education experience is never all about theoretical knowledge, it's more about applying what you learned practically. That's why programs like Co-op, CPT, OPT have come into being. \n\nSTEM OPT extension will just make this more possible.

Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of U. S. workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program.  OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nExpanding this program will enable companies to hire cheap foreign labor at the expense of American workers and students.

Here are my 5 reasons:\n1) Extension will help US startups have more less expensive high-level technical support.\nFACT 1: Everybody knows why startup is so important to American.\nFACT 2: US has never stop importing high education talent for the US job market demands. \n2) It is quite ridiculous for some negative comments saying that international students will harm the US citizens' employment.\nEmployers never employ students because they are international students!\nActually, it is a common sense that every employer wants to get the BEST students to meet their company's demand!\nThe BEST students can be US students as well as international students. The negative comments are assuming US students are inferior to international students which is absolutely TOTALLY WRONG! \n3) To be honest, I think international students will push US students to work harder to make themselves more competitive in the job market. I don't know why any US students will against for this extension as long as they believe in their ability, their potential and their creativity. \nActually US students' good communication skills will directly makes them more likely to get the job.\n4) Extension only helps the skilled international students have more TIME to get a job. BUT extension doesn't give any direct advantage to international students in their job interview or resume.\nActually a lot of employers are willing to choose US students because they want them to work for more than 10 years. \nBeing a US citizenship doesn't necessarily mean he/she will get a job even if he/she doesn't have any skill.\nThere is no country on the earth would grantee this, it would GREATLY HARM those citizens who work very hard to make their country prosperous. \n5) The reason why there is so many negative comments here is actually those who believe in themselves' or their children's abilities and potential US citizens don't care too much about the extension. They will still do the right thing to improve their competitiveness. \nI think people comments on this extension can be classified to these groups of people (involvement rate from high to low):\n1: International students who need more TIME to gain some job experience.\n2: Less competitive US citizens who are not willing to improve themselves and stay where they are.\n3: US citizens who have wrong concept regarding to what is the benefits and rights a US citizen should have.\n4: US employers who are suffering from finding the good employees.\n5: Active US citizens who have discovered the benefits form international students.\n\nAs a conclusion, the listed 5 reasons make me definitely support this OPT extension from a NEUTRAL position.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yin Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22348", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM students contribute a lot into U.S economy growth, especially in hight tech industry like Biotech, computer science, software/hardware development, and also very important to the U.S society diversity.\n\nCancel STEM will make huge impact on U.S economy, also, U.S university will become less attractive to foreign students.

What make America these people's destination is the great possibility of putting what they've learned into practical use as well as a diverse living environment. Think about this from the other side of the coin, if America doesn't have such merits, if we are poor and full of discrimination against outsiders, who would like to devote their youth, money and energy here just for foreign \"experience\"? The wisdom of acceptance and making fully use of its own advantageous international position is what makes a government competent, meanwhile makes this country promising and rich.\n(3)In the present trend of fierce competition of employment, it takes several months for a NCG with Master or PhD to find a job. It would be a loss both for the person and the company if the new hired employee failed to get H1B visa before the termination of OPT period. First of all, the company spend weeks screening CVs and months interviewing probable candidates and finally send out an offer to a graduate student whom the company is looking forward to help make some contribution and profit. Secondly, nonimmigrant students strive their way to learn advanced technologies and get degrees from American university, and American society have contribute a lot for the high-level education for all students. It is reasonable to have them work for American companies and make money then pay taxes to American government. Otherwise both the efforts and resources of American society and the endeavor of those students will be wasted at last.\nIt is really a frustrating and weird phenomenon that so many nonimmigrant students who have acquired knowledge and benefits from American society cannot contribute something back to the community just because they do not have enough period of time.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Emily Kang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19730", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "HAVEN'T You Done ENOUGH YET?

Many of them are not planning to stay in the US, leaving an even smaller number of potential hires for research institutions and businesses. The STEM program was created in order for the US to maintain its global leadership of technical advances. In an extended period of time, the program allows us to utilize the high-skilled workers in whom we have invested much educational resources. At the end of the program, the workers will leave the country unless they successfully win the lottery to an H1B work visa.\n\nThe STEM extension program benefits the US economy in many ways. There is an extremely high demand for STEM workers right now in the US. Companies are finding it so difficult to recruit researchers and engineers that it does not make sense to cut them off of a chunk of their employees after 12 months. Hiring international students is not cost effective - the companies will still lose most of these people at some point due to visa issues. If they want to keep the workers by submitting an H1B work visa application, they will have to pay high fees and lawyers and still face a low success rate of less than 30 percent. Nonetheless, companies are still recruiting international students because they really need high-skilled STEM workers.\n\nStopping the STEM extension program hurts businesses, especially small businesses in fast-growing technical fields, such as medicine, engineering, and software development. First of all, it will cost a lot of time and money for small businesses to search for new workers to replace existing workers on OPT work permissions, especially if they have originally planned for their workers to apply for STEM extensions. It would be even harder than it is now for small companies to compete with large corporations to hire competent workers if the pool of potential hires shrinks, as more than 50,000 STEM students near the end of their OPT work permission leave the country. Without the program, many STEM students will choose to leave the country right after finishing their degree, just as most non-STEM students do. This will worsen the hiring situation for many small businesses.\n\nThe STEM extension program alleviates the shortage of STEM workers in the US without harming the chances of employment of US citizens and permanent residents.

On the other side, if the rule can not be passed, the sequence will be extremely terrible.Anyone can image that. \n\nFirst, international students come to US to pursue a high-level degrees since they are so smart and diligent and they want to bring new ideas and new fresh blood to US. This is why US is still the most developed country in this world. If US start to block smart and diligent people, I believe it is also the sign that United States starts to fall.\n\nSecond, international students bring huge direct economic benefit to US. US has the most famous and best universities in the world, but US has no enough students to fill up all the great universities and pay the high tuition. International students pay expensive tuition and living expense to support these famous universities in US. And most of them will leave United State after they finishing their education. So they are the perfect consumers who only bring a lot of money to US without selling any thing. If this rule became illegal, then students in other country would found that the US do not welcome international students. Lots of great US universities will start to fall and bankrupt. The consequence is extremely terrible. \n\nThird, competing is best way to inspire US citizens' work passion and keep US being the most developed country in this world. Everyone knows catfish effect, I know it has a lot pains and it seems bad. But the natural selection is alway the truth. International students all try their best to be an expert in their area and they just like catfishes who can spur the local students. And most of them will leave US after several years. So they will not actually rob job opportunities from American people, they are just completing some great projects and have some practice for US in their best years. Actually, most international students have some weakness in language and culture, so if the companies can find a qualified american citizen for the position, then international students will have no chance to beat american citizen due to the language and culture. International students can only find the jobs that have no qualified american candidates. If there is no international students to work for these companies, they may hire unqualified employees who may largely injure the competitive power of these companies, especially high-end technology companies. Also, if they have no chance to work for US, they have to go to other countries, and enhance the power of other countries. \n\n... there are many other reasons that this rule has to be passed, if people who can decide the result have enough foresight, they will pass this rule as soon as possible. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qing Lan, University Of Illinois at Chicago", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0552", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "About me:\nI am data scientist in the silicon valley right now, and I was a student from University of Texas at Austin at the MS in business analytics program between 2013 and 2014.

Here are the reasons.\n\nFirstly, by allowing foreign people to work, America can improve its diversity. A good diversity is a symbol of a country that is powerful, compatible, and responsible, which is proof to the world that America is one of the strongest countries in the world.\n\nSecondly, lots of brilliant people who make great contribution to the society were just foreign students in America. There are many great professors in my University who play a leader role in their study field, and are not American citizen. Just because they have the work authority in America, they can have the opportunities to make great contribution to America and to the whole world.\n\nThirdly, there may be no competition between foreigners and American citizens. Foreign people can have work authority only for the jobs that cannot find any American citizens who are competent.In other words, American citizens and foreigners are complementary to each other. Foreigners can offer strength to American society where local people are not that good at. Isn't is a win-win thing?\n\nLastly, even if there exits competition, it is a good thing. With competition, people will have motivation to improve themselves and get better achievements.If everyone is too lazy to make progress and also afraid that others may make progress that surpass him/her, the society will stop develop, which is a disaster for the whole world. So competition is a good thing that push us to move forward. We have the ability to transfer the pressure from competition into motivation.\n\nIn all, the new OPT extension proposal will bring way more benefits than harm to American citizens and to foreigners.

If implemented, this new proposal will benefit not only the US economy as well as the international image of US.\n\nFirst, the US higher education system has attracted a lot of F-1 students in the past couple decades, bringing into US a big number of talents and a huge source of revenue. This is particularly important for public universities that relies greatly on government funding in this tough economy. The STEM extension has been one of the great feature that attracts so many hardworking students to pursue a STEM degree in the US. Through STEM extension, many of these students joined and started high-tech companies, that boosted the US economy and created more jobs. Eliminating the STEM extension could potentially make it harder for F-1 students to contribute to the US economy because there is simply too little time.\n\nSecond, more and more big US companies start to open branches oversea because the market there is relatively unsaturated and the cost is low. These companies tend to hear F-1 students with US working experience, which makes sense because they understand the US working culture and their own culture. The STEM extension gives F-1 students more opportunities to gain US working experience and eventually work in these US companies oversea. It really helps the US companies to adapt quicker to a different environment and help the local as well as the US economy, which improves the international image of the US.\n\nThird, the STEM extension might seem to make the US citizens harder to find jobs. This worry is unfounded. The number of STEM extension is very small to the number of the US citizens that are looking for jobs. Also the STEM related jobs are usually very demanding and not attractive to many of the US citizens, while STEM F-1 students who merely want to gain more experience would work super hard and productively on these jobs. Again, they are helping the US economy. \n\nIn summary, the STEM extension has been benefiting US in various ways. As a country that is known for talents immigration, the STEM extension is such an effective way that makes talents stay and really contribute to the US economy.

Here are a few thoughts I have:\n\ni) The universities' STEM programs will be more popular to international students.  These students pay a substantial amount of tuition to support the schools.  They increase the diversity on campus.  OPT is also a very good educational experience which can be viewed as a merit of our graduate level education system compared to other countries.  This will keep our universities advantaged when competing with other universities in recruiting undergraduate students from all over the world.\n\nii) Hi-tech companies and research institutes will be able to allow these OPT students to work longer.  Many projects could not be completed within 2 years.  It is a big loss that people have to leave before they can contribute more to the projects.  Recruiting a new person will be expensive because he will be much less productive compared to those who has worked on this for a while.  This will also improve the effectiveness of research fundings which are actually our taxes\n\niii) These people are also contributing to a substantial amount of taxes.  Indirectly, the companies they work for will also earn more and pay more taxes if these people can benefit the companies.\n\niv) OPT students are after all interns.  Unless the company wants to treat them as long term employees, most of them will leave after they gain enough work experience.  I don't understand why people are claiming they steal American's jobs.  They create value for the company which beats their foreign rivals and expands itself to create more jobs.  Someone also says they receive less salary.  How can you expect a new intern to earn more than other skilled workers?", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tony Gu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21359", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Longer OPT will definitely serve for better U.S in various ways.

Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010.

International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions.

Those large amount of money may come from various sources, but mostly, I believe, comes from US's tax payers ultimately (such as NIH funds). To train a PhD student in advanced science and technology fields is even more costly, thinking about experiments in life sciences or engineering fields. The computational facilities I am using now cost millions of dollars to build. After arming those PhDs with advanced knowledge and techniques, US government would like to send them back to their countries \"generously\" and let them make contributions to their own countries because the US government hasn't proposed a feasible way to keep them here. Is this too awkward?\n\n2) Many undergrad and master programs in universities usually get a lot of international students. They pay high tuitions for completing their bachelors and masters degree. The tuitions gained by those master programs will help the universities with their own funds. If the future students know they are not able to work in US after graduation, they won't enroll in those programs. Doesn't this affect incomes of those universities and local hires?\n\n3) International students who are working in US after their graduation contributes very much to US's advanced science and tech fields. Researches they did and products they made keep US a leader in the world. \n\n4) Those protestors to this new rule are majorly scared about competitions and they are essentially cowards.

As a nation of \"star alliance\", millions  people that come from all across the world are making their own contribution to it. The most outstanding people will of course want to see this land of wonders and miracles in their limited life. OPT policy is a very crucial regulation that both benefit the country and those international students. Here's why.\n\nFrom the perspective of international students, they would have a equal right to be able to obtain a fairly comfortable time period to show what they are capable of and thus make a difference. Now that there are many jobs and vacancies that are only available to US citizens which could totally understand. But at least, as the most advanced country, it should provide those hundreds of thousands international students a fair chance to choose their own destiny. That said, the OPT policy is a smart choice. It gives international students sometime to make their own preparation  and do better. With OPT, those advanced worldwide companies will have a wider range of choice of who they would like to hire. Personally, a employee who already has been working here is really smart and friendly as he/she has to overcome the language problem while in the meantime stand out among his competitors including native speakers as well as other excellent international students. So those students who are able to find an intern/job here are all best of the best. They stand out in their home country so they are here; here they still stand out because they are really excellent even though it is totally different culture and way of living, yet it did not beat those talented.\n\nFor our most advanced country side, compared to U.K., OPT helps attract a very large quantity of students. A large percent of them come here with fund from their family. Therefore the paid tuition would definitely promote the economy of the country. Moreover, students has to find a place to live. As a consequence, the Real Estate Company will anticipate a promising future. In addition, daily act ivies also need money. When students graduate, those excellent will be able to stay working for this nation. It is never a bad thing to absorb genius and excellent human resources from other country. As long as US have those people, it only gain more power over others as time goes by.\n\nI am an F1 student too. Due to my limited English language ability, I am not capable of depicting everything that comes to me in a nice and appropriate manner. Today I see this place to submit my personal idea and so I did. Hope my idea can be helpful to our compatriots who are also suffering from language problems that leads to lack of confidence everyday in different scenario.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bo Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13904", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "With a job market in such a dire state it is becoming even harder for an AMERICAN to get and sustain gainful employment and it seems that our goverment is working against those whom they are suppose to be working for, if this passes it will lead to important jobs going to foreigners and not to the many naturally born Americans who are finding adequate employment to sustain a family hard to find!

Albert Einstein, a Germany-born  physicist, traveled from Germany to USA because of its advanced quality of science research and free policy for Jews. He developed the general theory of relativity, and  helped United States win the race to build the atomic bomb, which finally terminated the World War 2. David Ho, a Taiwanese American HIV researcher who is famous for  pioneering contributions to treatment of AIDS. His Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy saved so many people tortured by HIV. \n\nSecond, as far as I know from the job hunting and working environment, still in the STEM field, the American citizens are needless to say much better in presentation in the  interviews, and they have a better known background. Most interviewer would know an average American high school or university, but they would only have heard of top 3  universities in another country at most. So the American and non American candidates are not even competing 'equally'. Have the STEM students been protesting about the  unspoken rule of this recruiting process? Never. They still work hard and send out hundreds of resumes, and they try to compete with much better grades and hard work.\n\nThird, if we cancel the extension rule, what will happen to United States? This nation will lose so many young talents to work for this country because it is so hard to get  work visa, and then restrict innovative invents in various areas such as IT, natural science, military, finance, and so on. If a country loses its creativity, it cannot  maintain power and also no longer dominate the world.\n\nAll in all, if people don't work hard, they will be obsoleted. If a country doesn't choose the best incentive for it's people to learn and work, and for it's companies to  grow and profit, this country will be surpassed. The best feature of America is its freedom and diversity, which is the most important reason why it's attracting people from  different cultures and backgrounds to unite and prosper over the years. The proposal of STEM extension will definitely be beneficial to the people of the US, and the future  of human beings.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Erving Dager", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16955", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hofacker, \n\nWhen you list the number of jobs taken by OPT students and the money paid to them, please also consider the profit they made to US companies, the tax they paid to support the society, and the new job opportunities they created using their talent.

The reason is very obvious, on one side they want to let more people know their country to increase their impact on the world, and also they want to make money from these international students! Why more and more people choose the United States for STEM degree? That is because they can find a stem related job after they graduate, if the stem opt extension ended, there is no doubt that most of international students will lost their interest to go to the US.\n2: Currently there are more than 50000 people who are already in 17 months opt extension, if this extension ended, all these people should leave the US immediately. Some of them may involved in some very important research or project, if they are forced to leave, that would caused countless lose to American Company, American Lab and School! So DHS should address this critical problem to reduce the lose to Americans.\n3: Nowadays a lot of research should last more that 24-36 months, if the student only have one year of OPT, it is impossible for them to finish the project, which is really a bad things. I worked for Oracle Internet of Things Project more than one year, a lot efforts has been made in the past year, but the final product is still under development, more time are needed for the project to be finished!\n4: Some people may says the STEM extension of OPT would allow international students to rob the job from US people, but the real things is that students in STEM extension period are also allowed to work in e-verified company, which means that international students would have the same pay as US people and they will also need to pay tax as US people. There would be no chance for e-verified company to hire low cost people. I worked for Oracle American Inc for more than one year, I can tell you that nearly 1/3 on my annual income as been reduced as tax to American government!\n5.

American exceptionalism was produced from Mom & Pop shops that provided their signature products and services to the people of their communities.

It must become illegal to make profits on the work of others.  For example, a manufacturer should not be allowed profits on a product bought to be a part of a final product to which they do nothing to add to its value and use it as they received it from its manufacturer.  Eq. An engine manufacturer buys spark plugs to put in his engine.  He should not make a profit on the spark plugs.\n\nEmployees with manufacturers and service providers that have been with the company for many years and have  been involved in many or all of the processes utilized to make products and/or provide services have become part of the processes in which they have been involved.

Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa. \nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Steven Sun", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3796", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Is it true that OPT workers often hold jobs that pay between $60-$90,000 a year , but they cost our Social Security system about $1 billion dollars a year?\n\nThe GAO issued a report in 2014 finding that this program is full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud and that the Department is not adequately overseeing it.

I understand that US citizens might have the concern that too many international students in the workplace might jeopardize their own work opportunities. However, I would like to point out that from the point of view of US government, it is much more beneficial than detrimental to give international students more opportunities. Although it would increase the competition, it is not a bad thing. Everyone can be motivated to hone their skills and be more efficient at work. \n3.

Most of the STEM students major in engineering, computer science and bio-related science. These majors have been shown to be less popular to domestic students anyway (40% total, National Science Fundation). On the contrary, these industries are expanding rapidly in these years, offering the community countless benefits, such as faster Internet, richer online community and new drugs and healthcare products. These benefits apply to all US citizens. Therefore, the F-1 students in STEM majors are a good supplementary to these fast-growing industries. This is how economy works, the expertise of a small group of people will benefit the general public. In addition, these foreign students have enjoyed the best education system in the world. It would be a huge waste of our education resources if we do not allow them to contribute their knowledge and expertise to our economy, but rather simply send them back to their home country. \n\nOn the other hand, the extension of the OPT program will not significantly affect the unemployment rate. Some voice shows concern of the impact of the foreign students on the job market. However, this is complete overstress, which can be shown from statistics. The total F-1 students in the country, according to SEVIS statistics (July 2015), is approaching 1 million, in which only 38% is STEM major, in which population 75% focuses on engineering, computer science, and biological and biomedical science. Comparing to the total labor force in the US (158 million) and the current unemployed population 7.9 million (5% unemployment rate, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Oct 2015), the population of F-1 students in STEM major is minuscule.

Also, the provision for extending F-1 status and any current employment authorization until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1 B visa has been requested is necessary for students and employees to maintain a valid work authorization status while they wait for their H1-B.\n\nThe STEM extension is essential because students gain valuable practical knowledge that supplements the knowledge that they gained from their academics. Often times the practical knowledge gained from 12 month OPT period is not enough to gain sufficient functional knowledge. Hence the proposed 24 month OPT extension is required so that students are able to complete their training, projects research etc and are ready to excel in their field.\n\nThe rule also guards agains the adverse effects on U.S. Workers. The rule mandates that the employer who is employing someone with a STEM extension would not lay off or terminate the employment of a U.S. worker due to the employment of the foreign national. It also makes provisions that the employer would have duties, hours and compensation commensurate with that a similarly placed U.S. worker. This would ensure that there are no adverse effects on the jobs of U.S. national as a result of this rule. Also, it mandates that the employer has work that further the knowledge gained by the student. This would ensure and cut down on the number of illegally working foreign nationals. \n\nThe rule correctly recognizes the effect of foreign students on the U.S. economy. Students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in 2013-2014 academic year. Foreign students specifically result in a huge benefit for the public colleges and universities in terms of the tuition paid as compared to in-state students.\n\nThe rule correctly recognizes that by earning a functional understanding of how to apply their knowledge in a work setting, students would be better positioned to excel in their field of work. As previously noted, the STEm extension would give sufficient time to students to complete their research, projects, tasks etc and gain a comprehensive knowledge as required by STEM courses. \n\nThe rule has correctly identified that the percentage of foreign students has been declining while that of globally competitive countries like Canada has been increasing. The proposed rule would help U.S. to remain globally competitive and attract the best talent from the world over. The rule has a huge impact as there are more than 34,000 students that are in US. as of September 15,2015. Hence, the fact that rule is brought in effect is extremely important.\n\nThe comments for the specific sections as requested by DHS are as follows:\n\n1. Length of research, development, testing and other projects for which STEm graduates from U.S. universities are typically assigned in the workplace:- As previously noted the length of the research projects etc. are often more than  the OPT period of 12 months. Hence, the proposed rule of an OPT extension is required so that students gain a strong functional and practical knowledge in their field of study. The ability to complete their training and functional application of their knowledge would also serve as a incentive to students who are planning to begin their study in U.S. and ensure that the U.S. universities and colleges remain competitive globally.\n\n2. Proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension and the ability for qualifying students to receive an additional such OPT extension based on a second STEm degree:- As previously noted the proposed 24 month OPT extension is essential for both foreign students and U.S. economy. Also it safeguards the interests of U.S. workers. I feel that an additional OPT extension based on a second STEM degree is also essential as often time the second degree is different from the previous one and a additional STEM would be required.\n\n3. Proposed transition procedures and alternatives to the potential courses of action:- I feel that DHS has correctly identified all the transition procedures and alternative and may take any one that it deems fit, in case need arises.\n\n4. Academic benefit of the STEM extension and the changes to the structure of list:- Specifically to students graduating from MIS programs, a sound functional and practical knowledge is essential so that they remain competitive in their field of work. i am sure that it is the case with other degree too.  DHS to take steps whatever necessary\n\n5. Imposing a firm accreditation :- I feel that DHS is better positioned to take a decision on this. \n\n6.

Removing OPT STEM extension will be a huge mistake as we will be losing a lot of talented people that are good in their respective fields. I recently got to know that US companies are paying for H1-B visas to get well qualified people into the country to work for them instead of this these companies can hire these students under OPT. These students are already aware of the culture and atmosphere here and would be easy for them and the companies to work together. Apart from these most of the students that come to USA to pursue their higher education is because most the students do not have the facilities and resources that are available in their countries. \nAs this topic came up many people are worried that American are not getting jobs because of such rules and foreigners. This is not true because most companies that hire STEM degree people are global companies and they hire people with talent. So, if an American citizen is talented they would hire them because they do not want to throw up money on sponsoring people from other countries for H1-B visas. So OPT extension will not affect jobs of the citizens. \nEconomically speaking, If OPT extension is removed many students back down from pursuing higher education in USA and this would mean lesser student enrolled in Graduate programs in universities and this leads to lesser money in education sector. \nAnd to be selfish we should use their talent that they gained from us and use it in developing technologies from our country.\nSome people are worried that these student may settle in the country. Aren't we all immigrants. this country is built by immigrants. And this country is the only country that is more diversified and everyone feels like home. \n\nSo to sum up I vote for OPT STEM 24 months extension.\nGod bless America.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7883", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "i am totally in favour of stem extension. this would in turn lead to human development with great minds of world being together in a free country like US. this opportunity for better world in large should not be lost.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Pushkar Raj", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10265", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "A wise country trains and employs its own citizens first.

Harry Reid blocked the Sanctuary cities bill protecting Americans who are being murdered by illegals because \"we'd have to buy 20,000 more prisoner beds.\"  Huh? \nWell, that money could come from the money you're letting corporations keep by hiring alien workers instead of our own Americans out of jobs.

OPT extension can not only help the international students put what they studied to the working market, but also make more contribution to the United States.\n\nSome people said that therere enough non-citizen worker in the United States and companies should hire more citizens, but actually technology companies like google, facebook, amazon and so on still keep hiring workers. Its really ridiculous to say no to international worker because of their non-citizenship. From my perspective, the United States should be a fair, democratic country and also each year welcome many many immigrants from other countries. If people in the United States just want to hire the people who come from the United States, I highly suspect whether the hiring criterial is fair or not because its not a competition of your qualification but your citizenship instead. Its just like the bias against black people before. I think as a democratic and fair country, this situation shouldnt occur.\n\nAlso, its claimed that hiring international students will do harm to the companies in the United States. But I highly counter this viewpoint in that companies need to hire the people who is qualified to work to solve the problems and make profit for them. So basically if companies reject to hire international students, it may turn out that the companies could just hire some low-quality local workers because they cannot hire high-quality worker from other countries. And this will definitely lower the efficiency of work, decreased the revenue of companies, and incur more expense due to the employment again.\n\nAside from the two reasons above, Id like to point out that hiring international students can bring many merits to the United States. On one hand, international students can better understand the culture of their hometown. So it could be much better for them to compare and contrast and come up with better ideas for the development of companies. For instance, I come from China and I studied in Taiwan for four years, and now Im studying in the United States. Clearly I deeply understand the current economic situation and profit opportunities in these areas. If a company which is developing game hires me, it will save them much time because I stayed for a long time in both Chinese mainland and Taiwan. Im way familiar with these two places and I can tell whether the game is suitable for the market or not. On the other hand, Its clear that most of international students work very hard. We have to improve our communication in English; we adapt ourselves into the brand new environment; we study for a longer time because of less familiar with English materials. And after long-term hard-work, we improve our skills not only in communication but also professional skills. And in most of cases, we are qualified for the jobs in the Unites States and we can make contributions to the United States. But if we cannot stay here, we have to go back to hometown and utilize our strength and skills to improve the economy of our home country. And obviously that situation will in turn damages the United States because were back after we get the skills from you.\n\nFinally, I strongly think that wise American will choose the right part and support the legitimate right of international students of longer OPT time.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zejian Zhan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12946", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the extension of OPT. \n\n1.

We've observed, from the standard test results, the admission rate, etc., that international students tend to perform extremely well in STEM subjects -- otherwise why the top universities give admission to so many international students studying STEM? \n\nAs an international student, we know we are good at STEM, and honestly, we are much better than U.S. students in general in STEM subjects. This is determined, solely, by the educational system in our own country. We know how consistently we are pushed and how hard we have been worked in subjects like math, physics and chemistry, biology, etc. As a matter of fact, training in these subjects took most of time in my life--yes, I mean it. \n\nWe all know that the performance in one area is determined by the person's commitment level in it. The harder one tries, the more time one spend on training such skills, the better at it one would get. Because of the emphasis our educational system put on STEM subjects, we international students are guaranteed to be better at them, as a big group.\n\nIt would be a natural choice for the U.S. to choose us international students to stay here in the U.S. and make a contribution for its industries with our talents in STEM -- just look at our performance in school. We are simply better, and that's why we are getting those STEM job roles--in the modern world, industries need more and more \"specialized talents\" for each job title, rather than \"Jack of all trades, master of none\".\n\nHowever, if we don't get the OPT extension, the majority of us, who have already got the job offer, would be forced to give up our earned job. It would be a extremely painful process for the companies, because not only most of their previous efforts in recruiting talents would be meaningless, but also that they have to compromise themselves with less ideal candidates. And the top STEM talents would be forced to go to other places in the world, make their top-level distributions to those countries and develop their economies. \n\nFurthermore, there's one statement the U.S. can make from its decision for OPT extension. At first, all your top universities give admissions to international students studying STEM like crazy. We have two different ways to interpret it: \n1) Those top universities, as it is supposed to be doing, give admissions to students because of their talents -- you choose us, because you RECOGNIZE that we are better.\n2) Those top universities, as it is not supposed to be doing, give admissions to students because of their financial backgrounds -- you choose us, because you think that we are richer. After all, there would be no financial aid for most of international students.\n\nTherefore, if the country indeed choose to deny the OPT extension, it is making two big mistakes:\n1) The mistake is stupid: you simply don't recognize the fact that international students are extremely good at STEM, and they would make a huge contribution to the relevant (well, all) industries in this country.\n2) The mistake is immoral: you are choosing to admit the fact that you lie to us that your society is based on meritocracy, and you dumped us like trash after you swindle a good amount of money from us. \n\nIt's your decision America.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by China Han", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11293", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal. \nFirst, from the long term prospective this policy is really beneficial for the development of the United States.

If the company need to sponsor H1B visa to a international student they need to first prove that there this no appropriate US citizen applied for that position. We cannot deny that the OPT extension may bring a little bit competition to the citizen in STEM majors, but please remember, the competition from international students is not a bad thing for the US students. If there is no competition, there is no growth and  development.\nAlso, most of the STEM majors are most highly science and technical based. On those aspects the United States need the contributions from the talented people all over the world. Right now the US is facing severe competitions from other developed and also some developing countries, if the citizens in the US don't even want to work against a little bit competition from the international students how the US can maintain its leading position in technology over other countries?

Traditionally, America is referred as a \"melting pot,\" and welcomes people from lots of different countries, races, and religions, all hoping to find freedom, new opportunities, and a better way of life.  It is this CHERISHED VALUE that attracts the most talented people all over the world to come to US and then contribute to the development of the science, culture and economy, making the US better and better.  For example, a considerable amount of the Nobel laureates in US are first-generation immigrants.  However, the prior OPT STEM extension cancellation pushes over ten thousands of people to leave US all of sudden.  If this occurred, this event would release a signal that US is not welcoming immigrants anymore, extremely violating its traditional value and also extremely discouraging talented people further come to US world-widely. \n\nSecondly, a majority of the students using OPT STEM extension hold a doctoral degree.  They actively work in colleges and companies to seek experiences that they could not obtain during their earlier studies, during which they apply their prior knowledge to some new research areas so as to advance the science and technology.  This process usually combines with the emergence of new ideas, collaborations and patents, novel products, and new entrepreneurs chances, which will eventually create more job opportunities in future.  This highly benefits the economy of the US.  Additionally, during the OPT period, students may find the weakness of their knowledge.  Then, they can contact their prior colleges so as to let them improve their quality of US education in future. \n\nThirdly, students using OPT STEM extension come from a variety of countries, each with their own special culture.  Having them together here helps US understand and learn the diversity of culture in the world.  For example, thanks to the immigrants with different backgrounds in the Bay Area, we now can easily enjoy different types food, music, art and literature.  \n\nBesides, at least I dont see the point of simply sending students in STEM areas back to their own countries immediately after their graduation.  Instead of letting them use their obtained knowledge to contribute the science and economy of US for a couple of years after their graduation, sending these talented doctoral students back to build their own countries stronger will significantly hurt US competitiveness in future. \n\nOccasionally, I heard from some people that they worry that these talented foreign students will steal job opportunities, making them more difficult to find a job.  However, the best solution to improve unemployment rate is to create more job opportunities rather than everyone brutally fighting for one job all the time.  Look at how many new companies and new job opportunities has been created by foreign students every year, then you can easily see if these talented students really steal your job or actually create a job for you!\n\nIn summary, I highly welcome this new policy, and I believe this policy will continuously attract the most talented people all over the world to build a stronger and better US with advanced science and technology, various culture, and dynamic economy. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wenju Bai, Stanford University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3131", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT.\n\nAs a STEM student, please understand that many of us may not intend to stay in the US for their whole life.

The international students have the required ability and skills to fulfill the huge human resource shortage in American industry, especially the Internet industry. It is really obvious that the country do need the international students to work for American companies for at least several years, because in fact there are not too many American students willing to study and have their career in STEM. I've heard about some survey that only one third of American high school students want to have their career in such fields like STEM, most them aim to become lawyers, doctors and financialists. So it's very important for America to have these international students to work as engineers.\n\n2. Nowadays, much more international students will return to their home country eventually. So it is completely unnecessary for some racialists to concern about our immigrantion tendency. Take myself as an example, I am a Chinese and now study engineering in UPenn. In fact, I have no plan to spend too much time working in America. I think I will return to Shanghai after the end of my opt.

Since OPT extension is one of the major reasons why international students choose the colleges in U.S., the colleges and universities in U.S. will be less attractive to them if there is no OPT extension and the benefit of the colleges and universities will be hurt. \n\nSecondly, international students have a lot of expenditures in U.S. during their study here. They contribute a lot to different industries as they rent apartments, buy cars and go shopping when they are in U.S.. So their expenditures maintain many industries prosperous and create more employment opportunities to U.S. citizens. \n\nBesides, they provide high quality employment to many high-tech companies. These high-tech companies need huge amounts of employees and U.S. citizens can't fill up all of these vacancies. The high-tech companies will be harmed if international students don't have the OPT extension. They will have a lot of positions which can't be filled up. So international students also maintain the development of U.S. companies and competitiveness in high technology. \n\nSome objector thinks this proposal will harm the U.S. workers. Quite the opposite, international students create a lot of employments for U.S. workers as their large expenditures in U.S. which increase the U.S. economy. Besides, since there are so many vacancies in the job markets which can't be filled up by U.S. citizens, international students help to fill up these positions without taking jobs from U.S. citizens. \n\nOverall, I support this proposal which is beneficial to the U.S. economy, U.S. education system and U.S. citizens.  \n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Stephanie Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18797", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think that is a good proposal.

Generally an employee will rarely undergo more than 6 months training and mentoring.

In the US, most F1 students choose STEM majors and STEM professionals play an important role in the society, because the America is a \n\ndeveloped country with the most cutting edge knowledge and technology. Foreign students, such as F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees, pay much higher tuition and fees than Americans do, \n\nwhich brings a big portion of income to American schools. By gathering this great amount of money, American schools are able to upgrade their facilities and hire more renowned faculties, and hence \n\nimprove the school reputation. As a result, more and more promising students would be attracted and inclined to choose these schools for pursuing a degree. In turn, when these promising students \n\ngraduate, they make contributions to the society in professional realms, which would also bring the school a good reputation and precious alumni network. \n\nTraining opportunity is very important to these F1 STEM student. STEM related positions require good logic thinking ability and analytical skills, so STEM students are in need of practical \n\ntraining opportunity after graduation. In most schools, STEM students take courses and can't get such training opportunities, but if they still can't get enough after graduation, they'll still be \n\nfreshman when come back to work in their homeland. Then they'll question about studying abroad and the advantage of studying in the world leading country will become far less than expected. The \n\nextension of practical training for F1 STEM students is just good enough for them to get trained. And in turn, within a reasonable long period, students' employers will feel well worth hiring such \n\nan international employee. F1 students pay taxes to the government everyday in their life and during practical training period, making contributions to GDP in the US. I think if we expand training \n\nopportunities for F1 students, many students would choose to go back to their homeland then, since they already get enough training and money, and no one wants to leave far away from his family. \n\nSince about 15 years ago, people all over the world has become interested in the US, because they hope to see this world-leading country and broaden their horizon. During these years, more and \n\nmore people has been traveled abroad, which greatly facilitates the communication between the US and other country. Students who studies in the US will unavoidable talk about their life frequently \n\nwith friends and relatives, which attracts them to travel in America. Each year, especially during graduation season and holiday season, we can see numerous parents come to visit their children \n\nand enjoy a pleasant family journey around the states. These international students and their families greatly benefit shopping centers, restaurants, hotels, car rentals, attractions and all \n\naspects of tourism.

If they have a college degree or a master's degree, they do not need to work as an intern at low pay to get further training.    OPT will lower the wages and living standards of American workers, and result in more citizens without technical jobs or underemployed.  \n\nAlso, there are studies that show there are many American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.

Someone may argue the non-citizens would take more job opportunities and lead to higher unemployment rate among the citizens. However, I would say we are actually creating more job opportunities rather than consuming the limited job resources. I think economy is not stable, but dynamic. There is not a fix number of job, but can be increased. The increase of job based on the development of economy. But how to develop the economy? There is no way but solve the problems and meet people's increasing demands, such as disease treatment, more entertainment and more comfortable life. All of these depend on the development of technology, the creation. As far as I know, most of the non-immigrant students take part in the jobs related to creation, for example, drug discovery and software development. The creation can help the development of the downstream industry which can make much more positions for the residence. The hard work of us non-immigrants is actually creating instead of consuming USA job resources.\n\nAs a non-immigrant student now in USA, I really appreciate the generous help given by the local people, the university and the government. You guys pay a large amount of money, time, patience and friendliness to educate a foreign student. I think our best way to pay back is to work in USA, help the development of the industry in USA, to create more jobs and improve the society. Personally I think if USA government would abolish the right of us non-immigrant students to stay a longer time and urge us to go back to our motherland, the input you guys have given to us would be meaninglessly wasted. I have heard that in Singapore, a foreign student would be asked to work for several years in Singapore after graduate if he or she has accept the scholarship given by the government. Compared with Singapore, I can hardly understand why one government would be that glad to pay the education but deprive the chance for the students to give back their gratefulness. \n\nI always believe what makes USA the powerful country in the world is because its freedom and generousness on chance. I feel like USA is more like a stage, instead of a specific country. Everyone can have his or her own space. It is this freedom booms the economy and society in USA. I faithfully wish that the citizens and USA government can keep believe this. Please don't waste your advantage! Please don't blow away the chance for keep improving! Please don't give up the most awesome way for development all the mankind has created in this great free land through hundreds of year exploration in the difficulties and darkness.

The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\nSO...I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.

I have been working since then in Yahoo as a software engineer on OPT/OPT STEM. To be honest I was really sad at first seeing the recent court ruling, which would terminate OPT STEM program if a new rule could not be established in place before the designated date in February 2016. I will have to leave the United States by then as the next H-1B filing will not happen until April 2016. It was hard for me to accept since I have been doing really well in Yahoo since the beginning of my career and have always been a top performer/contributor. This is also too soon to terminate my OPT training as I still have a lot to learn and convert what I have learned in my graduate program into my job. Therefore I am really glad to see that a new rule is proposed in such a short notice, and I wholeheartedly support this rule and honestly believe that this rule will bring benefits to STEM students as well as the U.S. economy.\n\n1. The OPT STEM Rule Benefits both STEM Students and the U.S. Economy\n\nTo be honest, I think the OPT/OPT STEM rule are the leading reasons that so many international students choose to pursue their education in the U.S. This rule allows students to apply what they have learned in practice/industry, which really helps students to get the gist of how things works in real life and how they can contribute to the society with their expertise. This way, international students will be able to use their talents to help U.S. companies grow and thrive. As I know, most international students, especially students from China are the best of the best, and I believe that they will make great contribution to the nation through the OPT/OPT STEM program. Without OPT/OPT STEM program, most international students would have to leave the country after they graduate, and what they have learned in the U.S. may not comply with the industry in their own countries, therefore leading to a waste of educational resources. Besides, a lot of international students may not choose to study in the U.S. without the OPT/OPT STEM program because they see no future for them after graduating. They would also feel that the United States is not welcoming them wholeheartedly thus not choosing to study in the U.S. This would cause a great loss in tuition/taxes income as well as the potential contribution international students could have made. For example, immigrants are among the cofounders of many top tech companies such as Google, Tesla Motors and even SpaceX. These are the companies that are really leading us to the future. The United States stays competitive in the world, partly due to its leading tech industry and international students are really a important part in these high-tech companies.\n\n2. The OPT STEM Extension should be 24 Months\n\nIt typically takes at least 3-4 years to master a skill, since the purpose of OPT is to put what students learned from academy to research/industry practice, I would say that OPT STEM combined with the initial OPT which adds up to 36 months would be sufficient for a true \"practical training\".\nBesides, many international students would like to have a real career by pursuing their higher education in the U.S., which in most cases is through H-1B visa. However, due to the increasing demand for H-1B visas in the recent years, even applicants with advanced STEM degrees have quite small chance of winning the H-1B lottery. For example, my wife and I have been filing H-1B petition for the past 2 years and still neither of us can get it, and having a longer gap-gap relief brought by the OPT STEM would definitely give more chance for STEM students/employees like us. Without a clear plan for our future, knowing that we have high possibility of getting a stable status would waste our energy which could have been put into making more contributions to the company into worrying about these kind of issues.\n\n3. Options to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted 17-Month Extension\n\nI think that students who have already been granted 17-month extension and those who are eligible to file an extension before the ruled terminating date in Jan 2016 should be able to continue working till the expired date on their EAD cards, even if the new OPT STEM rule cannot get through in time. I believe so not only because in my own case, my wife and I have already been granted 17-month extension, but also that these students get their extension while the rule is still in place and effective. They should not be paying for the huge cost of this decision simply because of the rule does not pass in time, and it is not even their fault. Most of them have already made a lot of plans based on their extension end date, and it is not fair to say at the least to let them endure the loss.\n\nSincerely yours,\nSusen", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Susen Zhao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17388", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Why is DHS setting regulations and rules for education in America?

Graduates can work without being bogged down by complexities of obtaining a speciality occupation visa\n- EAD makes recent foreign graduates attractive to employers who have some appetite for hiring people fresh out of school but do not want to invest heavily upfront in them. Employers are able to take chances and dip into a larger pool of graduates and scholars\n- It lets students in Schools remain focused on what they came to the US in first place - to study and research without thinking too much about if they have to pack their bags and move out soon after graduation. One year in OPT is not nearly enough to allow people fresh out of school to employ their skills and find their calling. Like the great education schools in US impart, it is equally important to get a great grounding at work before students can go out on their own, to their home countries or anywhere in the world and do justice to their education and investments. Experience in US benefits the students, the society and organizations of all sizes in US.\n\nThere is another large pool of students in US, who are also non resident aliens but who are not on F-1 visas. They are partners of primary beneficiaries of workers in specialty occupations. Partners on H-4 and L-2, for example, or the beneficiaries of H-1 and L-1B visas themselves. While they may be attending school full time, they do not get the benefit of an OPT after earning their degrees. OPT and CPT should be extended to such students as well, to allow them to use their education gained in US without being chained by their visa classifications. There is a large pool of such dependent partners that goes to schools and works as hard, if not more, as students on F-1, but is deprived of an opportunity to be gainfully employed just because of their visa classification. H-4 EAD is a step in right direction, but offering OPT to students irrespective of their visa classifications only truly benefits all international students who work hard to make their dreams come true some day.\n\nAnother important aspect that DHS should look at is prevention of fraud in education industry. Especially, schools for profit that may be shops for obtaining a CPT and OPT while adding little value to students who fall victim to the lure of getting a work permit by enrolling in such schools. In the long run, students are deprived of quality education while racking up huge bills for tuition.

I will first address the benefits of having the OPT STEM program and then point out many flaws in criticisms against it.\n\nOPT STEM program creates job and value-add for U.S. economy. There are approximately 900,000 international students studying in the U.S., and they pump $27 billion into the U.S. economy each years, supporting 350,000 American jobs. It is not uncommon for an overseas family to spend $100,000 or more per year for their child's college tuition and living expenses in America. Many of these students are attracted to U.S. universities not only because of the high education quality but also the prospects of working for U.S. firms for some time to learn the valuable skills that will benefit their long-term career goals. One year of OPT is apparently not enough to cultivate any meaningful experiences, especially for STEM fields whose research projects usually last for years. Not having the STEM option will make the whole U.S. education experience less attractive compared to other U.S. competitors who are aggressively attracting foreign talents such as Singapore, Germany, U.K. etc,...\n\nThe most important contribution of STEM students though are the new products and businesses they create after joining the workforce. According to a report by The New American Economy, 40% of the largest U.S. firms were founded by immigrants or first-generation immigrants, including many hottest tech startups. For example, Whatsapp, which sold to Facebook for $19 billion, was founded by a Ukrainian immigrant. In Silicon Valley, 50 percent of the tech companies, from Google to eBay, have an immigrant founder. 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child or an immigrant. For every 100 international STEM students who remain in the U.S. after graduation, 262 American jobs are created.\n\nCritics of the STEM OPT program have argued that STEM graduates accept lower pay, steal job and that there is no lack of demand for STEM workers. These claims are extremely ill-informed. First foreign STEM graduates usually work for high-tech firms and require much higher pay, especially those with Ph.D. degress.

In this way, the STEM OPT extension will keep the US companies competitive in the global market, and help recover the US economy since 2009. \n\nFinally, the STEM OPT extension should be 24 months. STEM related projects usually last a long period. If the extension is too short, many projects will not be finished because the experts in charge of project implementation cannot stay in US any longer. That could cause a huge loss for hi-tech US companies. Thus, the duration of STEM OPT should be extended to 24 months. \n\nIn conclusion, DHS should be supported for implementing the STEM OPT extension rule.

Just imagine what gonna happen if we lose these great people? Many companies, especially the high tech companies would slow down and even stop.

Most of people get skilled after hired for one year or two. The answer for the companies is definitely no. None of companies wants to hire new employees every year and spend a lot of time and money on training. We should definitely have them serve us for longer rather than forcing them back to home! We should take full advantage of our resources rather than wasting our time and money on short-term forces.

It attracks foreign talents to the U.S and stimulates U.S. economy because of all the consumption power the foreign students are bringing in. If the extension does not pass, US will lose advantage in the education sector and other linked sectors, to countires such as the UK, Singapore, Australia, China. Other countires are strenghening their attraction to international students. Their economy are going to benefit as a result, at the expense of the US losing advantage.\n\n2. This extension policy will not reduce the number of jobs available  for US citizens, as it clearly states that only when there is no qualified US worker, an employer can then hire OPT students to fill such positions. This is a supplement to US work force, not a competition.\n\n3. Many sectors are strongly supported by the exisitng OPT extention act, if vacated without renewal, these sectors are going to take a huge hit, existing projects that are currently generating revenues for the US will be abrupted, resulting in another economic crisis for the US as a whole due to chain reaction. The labor force for these positions are already in short supply, it will be extremely difficult to recover from such hit. US citizens are going to lose jobs if this policy does not pass. \n\n4. The current STEM sectors are not satuated even with the existing OPT extension act, in fact, such labor is still in demand with foreign talents hired. Taking away the foreign group of labor force will result in further decrease in production.\n\n5. Most of the STEM sectors consist of companies  that have international business. These US companies need native students who are well educated, with enough knowledge and experience in these US companies at the same time, familiar with local culture. This is another main benefit that OPT extension is currently bringing to the US. Internation trade will be hurt severly if these US graduated students are not absorbed into such US companies. OPT extension is exactly the way to boost US economic power internationally. There is already high demand for talents to fill such international positions, taking away the foregn supply will cost the US a huge amount of money and time to look for and train more qualified us citizens. Again US will lose advantage to countries utilizing native students in their economic advances.\n\n6. Most opposing comments point out that OPT extension will take away jobs from US citizen.

Reg. 63,376-404 (proposed Oct. 19, 2015).\n\nBackground\n\nI worked in software development for two decades before going to law school; written three books on computers and software development; testified before Congress four times on labor issues related to immigration; and written the book \"Sold Out\" that describes employment immigration policy in the United States, including the Optional Practical Training program (\"OPT\").\n\nComments on the Proposed Rule\n\n1. DHS did not consider all the options.\n\nThe proposed rule states that DHS considered three options for dealing with OPT. When it was considering the proper duration of OPT, DHS neglected to consider whether non-students should be allowed to work after graduation on student visas at all. That is, the duration of OPT should be zero, rather than 36-months. The concept of allowing aliens, who are not students by any definition of the word, to remain in the United States and work is in conflict with the purpose of student visas and should be reevaluated.\n\nDHS also did not consider the alternative of winding down OPT extensions that are already in place. The District Court graciously allowed DHS to avoid a train wreck after its debacle with the 2008 rule. DHS is unlikely to get such a grace period and is setting up another train wreck.\n\n2. The OPT program is a solution in search of a problem.\n\nIn the 2008 OPT Rule, the purpose of OPT was to provide labor to industry with no educational justification. In the proposed rule, the purpose of OPT is to attract more foreign students by providing a mentoring program. The fact that DHS cannot establish a consistent justification for the OPT calls into question whether the program serves any purpose at all.\n\n3. DHS is just going through the motions in this rulemaking process.\n\nThe 2008 OPT Rule, first expanding OPT beyond a year, was proposed to DHS at a dinner party as a means to circumvent the H-1B quotas. From there, DHS prepared the rule in secret, only consulting industry groups in support of the measure. The first the public learned that DHS was considering an OPT expansion was when DHS put the rule in place without notice and comment. The OPT program, itself, was created without notice and comment. As such the question of what the appropriate duration of OPT should be was never subjected to any serious review.\n\nThe same question is before DHS now and the agency is giving it no serious consideration. The agency already announced what its decision would be last year.\n\nIn the original OPT expansion DHS failed to consult in advance with anyone who might be opposed to the measure. The same has happened again here. Various groups in support of this measure have posted on their web sites that DHS has discussed this measure with them to solicit ideas and concerns over that past year. However, I have been unable to find any labor group opposed to OPT expansion that DHS has reached out to.\n\nDHS's restricting of input to groups in support and making them aware of such rulemaking also restricts the views in notice and comment. Under Executive Order 13,563, DHS is supposed to provide 60 days of comment. Without any explanation DHS has cut the comment period in half (even the 2008 OPT Rule gave 60 days for comments). That gives those DHS has excluded from the rulemaking process up to now, limited to time get the word out and to do research to prepare meaningful comments. Given DHS's abject failure to comply with notice and comment on this subject before, DHS (1) should have had a proper notice and comment period, (2) should have consulted with those having a wide range of views in advance of publishing a proposed rule and (3) kept an open mind on the appropriate duration of OPT.\n\n(continued)\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by John Miano", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9797", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This F1- OPT extension is definitely a very wise choice for both the US government and the international STEM students.\nSTEM graduates using OPT extension will contribute a lot to the US companies and economy. \nIt will be a great loss for US if these STEM students leaving the U.S.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by George Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13363", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I SUPPORT this rule.\n\nDiversity is very important for the U.S. Lots of STEM students are contributing and will continue contributing their efforts to help US become better and stronger in the field of STEM.

And the PAY WOULD NOT REDUCED because of this rule as adequate measures taken. Also this new rule restricts that there is no less pay for any of the OPT students. SO this means employers would not consider the international student for they can work at a lower pay, so actually this rule benefit American citizen more than OPT students and it PROTECT citizen employment.\n\nI believe there are a lot of people here put the negative comments just because they misunderstood the definition between ILLEGAL and LEAGAL IMMIGRANTS/TEMPORARY WORKERS. Please understand that there is a clear and well-defined difference between ILLEGAL and LEGAL immigrants/temporary workers to fill the skilled jobs, and we should not create confusion about this rule on that basis as this is LEGAL OPT. \nPlease do not deviate from this Legal OPT Concept, by citing irrelevant points of illegal migration/illegal immigration etc. Similarly in global community like US there is no such thing as foreigners being hired by employers, as everything is conducted LEGALLY in US.\n\nI also want to tell a truth, since I know a data from website, more and more students have started to go to other countries like ENGLAND. Because, they think OPT extension may be stopped by the court in US; and in England, the education is less expensive for a Masters Degree. However, this change will make America lose more than $125000 for each Masters seat per year as tuition fees. If there are no students for Masters STEM, there will be a loss of $ 31250000000 per year to USA with 250000 proposed foreign students.

You should consider this seriously, because their projects/work will be halted, and because there are not enough skilled worker who just have has trained and gained the required knowledge to continue their work, this will affect employers/Industry for $70000000000 worth of projects/works/research and other revenues to US for 1 year till Feb 16th 2017. \nImagine that suddenly on Feb 16th, your Facebook collapse, your Google collapse, your electricity supplier suddenly give you a call saying that there may be a lot of recovery work to do but they need more time since they do not have enough people there, and may stop service for your house few hours each day, all because these STEM people who you have misunderstand have has been there to support for your everyday life, but you now force them to leave this country! I am not here to say there is no talented people in US, it is just because there are a lot of STEM OPT people dedicate to our everyday life, this is what we are living now.\n\nAmerica is survived by the people, skilled workers and big and large business and it is the duty of DHS to protect the US economy and US people by enacting rules/legislation like this.

These students chose to serve for U.S rather than other nations because U.S. offer them better opportunities to fulfil their dreams, to make real discoveries or to build a better world. \n\nIf we gave international students, who have proved their talents in the field of science and technology, better opportunities, they will in turn serve this country better.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yanfeng Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13385", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I welcome this new Rule for OPT Stem Extension for 2 years.This rule will benefit all the students and tech sector as well.US economy will boost because of this new rule, because of the skill training.US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months.

After graduation, I have been working as a postdoc fellow at a world-famous non-profit research organization to gain more experience for my future career. Without an OPT extension, I'll likely have to leave the United States when my current 12-month OPT expires. That's why I am really glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension.\n\nI believe that many comments have talked how the OPT extension will provide benefits for both students and employers, or even the economy of the United States. From my point of view as a scientist, I simply want to point out that a 12-month peroid is not enough for a really innovative research project in the scientific area. Take myself for an example, I have been working on a project for 8 months and I just started to obtain very promising results recently. In order to finish this project, at least a few more months, or even more than one year is requried, and you can't predict it because it's a totally new discovery, and that's how science works. If I have to leave the US, my advisor will have to find someone else who have enough background and expertise to continue the research, and sometimes it's very difficult. That's a huge waste of time and the finacial support from National Institute of Health. Many of my friends who work on other scientific areas have similar issues. Things get even worse when colabation of several institutions is involved. Furthermore, the elimination of OPT extension have already made my friends and I feel unclear about the future and it's so distracting that we can't focus well on the research. Thus, I really hope that the new rule will be implemented by Feb. 12, 2016.\n\nThank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by K J", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18124", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this rule.

I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThese benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of All Americans\n\nFor more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world into our nation, enhancing our diversity, culture, and economy. Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tom Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4954", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am keen to gain industry exposure in the area of my interest which I intend to leverage for my Doctoral studies in the future.

Keeping these high tech companies thriving is of paramount significance to maintain the leading role of US in the world. To achieve so, the most important thing is to have enough well educated and high quality employees working for these high tech companies. Unfortunately, nowadays there is a huge lack of well-educated employees working for these companies due to the rapid development of high techs in the modern society which need a large number of high quality employees with high education degrees.\n\n\nI used to work in a few top engineering schools in US and noticed that the majority of graduate students are international F-1 nonimmigrant students. These students are very talented with solid academic backgrounds and are well trained in the graduate schools in US. Most of them receive fellowships as well for their graduate education. These F-1 nonimmigrant students are well suited for high tech companies. However, with the current OPT of 12 month, there is not enough time for these high quality students to do the job hunting and get trained for those high tech companies. Given that the current high tech is so complicated, it usually takes a long time for training even for high quality students with high degrees. For instance, at intel, it usually requires 8 to 12 months to train fresh engineering students with Ph.D degrees before they can operate equipment independently  and contribute to the company. One year OPT can ONLY allow them to complete the training without further contribution to the company, which is a tremendous loss not only to those high tech companies but also to the economy of US. It is no wonder that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook complained that were losing some of the most talented people.\n\nWith the OPT extension to 24 months for STEM major students and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students, those high tech companies will be able to recruit enough well-educated and high quality students who can work for them without worrying about their working authorization since day one of their jobs in the companies. Given the H1-B numbers are so limited, the STEM OPT extension can largely relieve the pressure of high tech companies to hire high quality students legally working for them.  \n\nTo conclude, it is very important to expand OPT extension up to 24 months for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students, which is essential to improve the competitive strength of high tech companies in American and also keep US economy prosperous. Therefore, I strongly support OPT extension up to 24 months for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Matt Shiao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19654", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.\nThis expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of \npayroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay.

The extended OPT can attract the best talents while controlling the total number of immigrants at the same time.

After the three year period, the best and the brightest of the world will be servicing the people of the United States of America. This regulation, however, will not increase the total number of permanent immigrants to the United States at all, for the simple reason that an OPT extension is only a temporary working authorization that will end in at most 36 months. The fixed annual H1B cap, which directly restrict how many people can obtain H1B visa, and the green card application process are more relevant to how many immigrants can enter the U.S. each year.

International student make decisions to go to US because of the advantage of long time OPT. With the 29 months OPT(the OPT period before the proposal) in STEM fields , international students increased for 28 thousand to 1.2 million since 2008, and 350 thousand international students currently seek their degrees in STEM fields in United States. Now if the OPT could be 12+24 months, more international students could pursue their degrees in STEM fields in US as the trends indicate. As a international student myself, major in computer science, I chose to to run after my master degree in the U.S. instead of UK, Singapore or Canada , just because it provides the 12+17 (before the proposal) months OPT for international students to sharp themselves after their graduation. Now it could be 12+24 months, I feel that I have made a right choice. And I believe, the OPT extension would attract more students to US to pursue their degrees. \n\nSecond, the OPT extension benefits international students, which benefits the US economy.  International students have contributed to the US economy. According to NAFSA, international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. As I stated before, with attractive OPT extension the amount of international students should increase, in turn could contribute to US economy.

I graduated from a great university in USA after I complete my bachelor degree in China. When I decide to study aboard for master degree, USA education is most attractive. One of the reasons is because of OPT STEM program. For STEM major, it is more important to work what you learned. OPT STEM program will provide more change for international student to contribute to USA. Based on this benefit, I choose to come to USA. Currently, students pay more attention on the work opportunity when they decide to choose where to study. Without STEM program, few and few international students will come to USA. We all know international students take account significant weight within those majors. Without huge students source from USA, American education industry will suffer a lot, as well as the local economy. \n\nSecond, OPT STEM is critical for high tech company. STEM program is focus on the science, technology, engineering and math major, which is required by high tech company. Those companies, like Apple, google, Uber etc, contribute huge job and economy to USA. And competitive high tech company is makes what USA looks today. For those companies, it is difficult for them to find the perfect one without training them for a while. Under STEM those company trained graduated students to make contribution to company and society. Since the students under OPT STEM are just graduated, they received the most up to date knowledge and open to any new information. The solid knowledge based and open mind is critical for high tech company to make the progress. \n\nFinally, OPT STEM is helpful for health USA employee market. Based on my working experience, most Americans do not like the analysis work. However, it is more important in the current era. Data year is already around. Large companies seek talents with science major as desperate. However, most Americans could not fill into the gap. International students with OPT STEM are another source for this type market need. Students graduate from top tier university equipped with advanced knowledge can help those company to solve the unbalance between demand and supply. With better employee structure, company will continue to contribute work opportunity and value to society. That is the two win track. Otherwise, without supporting from analysis, bad decision may happen from company. More and more company will fire employee to reduce cost. No one wants to see that. \n\nBased on those reason, I believe OPT STEM is the important program and will beneficial to USA overall. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael  Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15472", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Americans are not who they are today without immigration.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuchen Song", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12443", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international chemistry PhD student from China and was working at a pharmacy company and I'm currently using my OPT program. \n\nWhen i decided to pursue higher education before I graduate from university, I had multiple options to get my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Like what I mentioned at first place, I'm currently under my OPT program and at the time about to get extension, however the project I'm doing now need at least another one and half years. More importantly half of my team members is similar situation like my. If the OPT extension time is too short, we will lose our VISA before the projects completion which will cause a lose of project and progress of the company.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there and have family, friends there, I'd like to return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nHope more people support this good rule!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rong Su Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16554", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As an American citizen and taxpayer, I want this stopped immediately.

No one will deny that it's the most critical time for US economic recovery from the depression since 2008. We will see that a lot of technology companies make great contribution to the economic increase during the recent years, like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc.. The blooming development of these IT companies not only contribute the US domestic economics, but also improve the global impact of US. For these companies, the F-1 non-immigrant students are the most important resources for their product innovation, technology development and marketing expanding. As we have seen, a lot of F-1 non-immigrant students after their graduation choose to join these company and start their career; at their first few years, they work much harder than any other long-staying employees and also bring a lot of energy to the companies. Therefore, we can't set too much limitations on their training opportunities after their graduation; STOPPING THEM MEANS STOPPING US ECONOMICS!\n2. As some critics mentioned that, F-1 non-immigrant students will bring more competition to US natives on job hunting. I think they may ignore one important fact that most of F-1 non-immigrant students are pursuing high-technology positions while most of the natives are pursuing more reliable and less-skilled ones. During my graduate school time, most of the graduates are international students especially in the areas with expanding job marketing, like computer science, electrical engineering, biology, chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. For the students in these areas, their job hunting competitors are also F-1 non-immigrant students. I didn't see any potential problems for natives to come into the job marketing which are designed for natives, e.g., jobs requiring lawful working permit or citizenship. Therefore, THE COMPETITION BROUGHT BY F-1 STUDENTS ARE NOT INTENDED TO NATIVES!\n3. At last, I would mentioned a big fact that the unemployment rate of the past months are decreasing every month in most of the states in US. It's worth to mentioning that this unemployment rate didn't cover the non-immigrant F-1 students. So this means the US natives are getting more and more jobs opportunities even there are also an increasing number of F-1 students all over the country. For Houston, even the oil price is kind of low which greatly affect the oil and gas industries; however, the unemployment rate of last season decreases from 4.8% to 4.3% if we are noticed that the laying off is still going on during some oil and gas companies.

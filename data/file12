Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at Acer, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back Taiwan eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of Taiwan. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nHope more people support this good rule!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by CHI-HUAN HUANG", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8101", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the 24-month OPT extension rule.\nI just got hired by a fortune 500 company in STEM. My future boss told me that it took so long to find a perfect fit for the position.

If they fail to get employed in the first three month of OPT, they have to leave the US. Three month is a very short time for job hunting and those who succeed must be of great merit to the employer. For the employers, they definitely want to keep their employee as long as possible instead of being forced spending money again on finding a new guy after the OPT 12-month. So the 24-month OPT extension would benefit both the employers and the employees.\nI believe a wise company would consider every aspect before they hire an OPT student. Those OPT students who get hired have already proven their value to the company as well as to the country.

Im glad to see the proposed rule for re-instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. This is great for U.S. economics, U.S. STEM companies, and STEM graduates.\n\nI received my Master of Science Degree in Architectural Engineering on May 2015 and am working in the energy practice of U.S. with OPT. In the company I have been working on several big energy efficiency impact evaluation programs cooperating with large utilities and several states energy efficiency committees. Through hard-working and strong technical skills learned in US universities, Im making a great contribution to the client and the energy efficiency industry. Its an honor for me to make an influence in the energy efficiency industry. Through consistent learning and hard-working, Ill be more professional and make a greater contribution to the energy efficiency industry. However, the bad news is without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will have to leave the U.S. when my OPT period ends. Considering its a lottery process and very low probability to get an H1-B visa, I strongly hope that this proposed rule can be passed before February 12 2016, so that I can continue making contribution in the energy efficiency industry.\n\nThe additional OPT length will allow STEM students to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional area. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. I think these benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S., bring more funding to U.S. universities, and more importantly allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking.\n\nI have a lot of international students working in high technique fields in U.S.. Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates like them will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Additionally, expanding practical training opportunities for international STEM students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further refuel the U.S. economy. However, it will be a disaster for both STEM graduates and STEM employers if these STEM graduates have to leave U.S.. The worse thing is these STEM graduates will go back to their countries and work in their companies which will definitely impair the strength of US companies. \n\nAs we know, the United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. According to associated study, one international STEM student working in U.S. can create more than two jobs to US career market. Its because these students provide valuable hands-on and great educational experience to the STEM employers. Therefore, hiring international STEM students wont affect U.S. citizens seeking jobs. On the contrary, international STEM students can make a great contribution to the U.S. economic.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope that this new rule can be implemented by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your patience, time, and support in this matter. I really appreciate that.\n\nSincerely,\nFrank Jin", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Frank Jin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5318", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal as the extension of OPT will attract and retain more excellent international students who will greatly contribute to USA.

Few suggestions as an international student in the STEM field:\n\n1. Can you look into the he number of days that an F-1 student may remain unemployed during the practical training period.\n\nThe 90 days unemployment period during the initial period of the post-completion OPT is very stringent, as nowadays it is very difficult to secure employment, unless employment has already been agreed upon before initiation of the post-completion OPT. In addition, it is increasingly difficult for international students to secure jobs and this 90 days unemployment rule makes it very very difficult. Can you abolish the 90 days unemployment rule and revert back to the old rule, (according to the earlier rule, international students got their entire 12 months whether or not they were employed) and abolish even the proposed additional 60 days unemployment period rule. In short, can you abolish any limit on the unemployment period, allowing them to get their entire duration. Typically, international students get jobs but securing sponsorship is difficult. So, abolishing this unemployment period will reduce stress on the students who want to follow the legal and ethical means to secure employment in STEM fields.\n\n2. Can you also abolish the rule requiring international students to work only in their field during the post-completion OPT and extension periods. While I understand and support that students should eventually land jobs ONLY in their respective STEM fields, allowing them to perform any work during this transition/interim period will make them financially stable and make it less burdensome for them and the US economy. You could consider allowing students to work legally anywhere or atleast anywhere in their school.\n\nHope you will consider these suggestions to make the proposed changes better for both the students and the US government.\n\nThanks", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Srinivasan Rasipuram", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4636", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "1. The training experience in OPT is necessary for the academic study of students. Without enough practice through OPT period, the college and university will lost a large number of potential students who want to come to U.S. to learn the advanced knowledge and know how to use it in the real world. The american education will be underestimate, because all the academic studies are theoretical instead of practical. Even U.K. updated their non-immigration policy in recent year to attract more global student to study in U.K. \n\n2.Especially the tuition and fees from graduate students could be a large part of revenue for an university. If the university lost this part of fund, it may bring some teacher lost their job. In fact the OPT extension will produce more job opportunity because the universities have more money to hire faculties.\n\n3. The adverse effects to U.S. workers. It is known all around the world that U.S. is a country of freedom, not to mention the first amendment. Just like Apple produce the iPhone in China, a lot of other big company move their product support or customer service business out of the country. Thus, it is not OPT or F1 student who steal the job from Americans, but the competition is changed from national to global. In fact, I believe the stress or attention which OPT extension give to the 'hard working Americans' could be an motive to the workers to make them to consider continuing education or work even harder. \n\nGenerally speaking, I think OPT extension will not cause an adverse effect to U.S. workers, but improve the economic environment which provide more job opportunities to U.S. workers in the end. If there is a one who steal the job, then it is the economy not foreigners. If a worker is not qualified for a job, he is not qualified without OPT extension policy. The companies always have plenty ways to find more qualified labors. However, without OPT extension policy, the american higher education will be less attractive for foreign student. The education level will be affected as well. Therefore, I strongly support on the policy of 24 month OPT extension.\n\nThank you very much. \n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mengjie  Han", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22286", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "SAVE OUR KID'S JOBS,,,I KNOW OBAMA WANTS TO MAKE AMERICA A 3RD WORLD COUNTRY,,,AND A GOOD JOB HE HAS DONE", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wyllo Sanders", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7468", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think a new extension policy is absolutely necessary.

But I am against someone who wants to stay here permanently after their short term practical experience. If every engineer from India wants to come here and stay here permanently then this room will be full in no time. Besides that this OPT extension rule is created by corporate money sharks who wants to destroy employee benefits and run their business by paying peanuts to technology workers. We will not allow it and we don't want that to happen. This is something we need to fix to protect the US worker's interests. Because United States of America has to give priority to its workers who build this nation. Have to protect the pensioners who contributed a lot to this society. Our government has to make strong laws to protect frauds from countries like India, China, Mexico to claim jobs by faking resumes and creating fake experiences. Current laws formulated by DHS is not even enough to trap  such impostors and fraudsters let alone punish them. If DHS is trying to favor Indian students/foreign students this law will be thrown out anytime in the court next year. DHS clearly know about this as well. So my comments are not about all Indian students but about majority of them.You were talking about the TOEFL/IELTS scores and competency in English. Competency in English is not judged by the marks you score in those exams because Indian students are well known to cheat those exams. Especially it is well known to you as well that American consulate stopped accepting student visa applications from candidates in Hyderabad in the state of andhra pradesh due to widespread cheating in TOEFL exams. You guys pay ton loads of money you don't have and appoint proxies to attend these exams and show your great marks to visa officers to impress them and get visa. Shame on you!! And you're blabbering her about your competency and high score in IELTS and TOEFL. Just because you have some Indians working in the silicon valley don't brag that Indians have contributed a lot to silicon valley. I can without any shred of doubt say that you guys are absolutely replaceable. You guys can be replaced with an American guy with less pain in training. I have worked for technological giants and with Indian co workers and Americans I can say that some of the contract workers we have had absolutely horrific communication skills. \n\nMy company later stopped taking contractors from the consultancy due to strong recommendations against the fake resumes and fake profiles fabricated by these money hungry consultancies.  I personally caught many candidates lip syncing to Skype Interviews and they have without any shame admitted the crime because they need a \"job\" to stick back this country. If I were asked to name the consultancies which were rejected and candidates names in a court I would go and expose them proudly. So don't give me a lecture on what would be work culture of Indians who share their work desktop with proxies in India to get the job done. I am sick and tired of hearing Indians pontificating about the great work culture they have. And that's the main reason why they leave India permanently to come here in USA to get Masters for the sake of making money and get OPT training for Green Card and settle down here  and  a few years later they would be complaining about corrupt system in India and thankless employers you have there. So the decision is for DHS to take and if they don't make strict laws to bring this fraudsters into lime light then this law will be thrown out very soon. \n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Thomas Hayden", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7029", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "! The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. The Obama administration is making it so an employer would financially benefit by hiring a foreign student with a STEM degree, which is one in the field of science, technology, engineering or math, over hiring an American's child with the same degree. The OPT program gives employers financial benefits of up to $12,000 per foreign student they hire. This program violates the constitution in several ways; equal protection of the law, unless the arrogant Obama regime says otherwise. This program deserves our hate as it discriminates against Americans and uses our tax dollars to do it! There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers in the U.S. If that were true, wages for those workers would be accelerating rapidly. They are not; wages for STEM workers have been flat for years. The same cannot be said for revenues for big tech employers. Those have been growing rapidly in recent years. Just what doesn't the Obama administration get; Obama whines about lazy Americans who won't work to earn a STEM degree, but when they do he stabs them in the back. Many STEM degree holders are working out of their field because the federal govt incentivizes hiring foreign workers to the detriment of Americans; that is nothing short of a betrayal to America's children.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers.

Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy. Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n  Rejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries.\n  Admitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all.

Please do not deviate from this Legal OPT Concept, by citing irrelevant points of illegal migration/illegal immigration etc.\n\nSimilarly in global community like US there is no such thing as foreigners being hired by employers, as everything is conducted legally in US.\n\nAlready students have started to go to ENGLAND because of the OPT extension is stopped by the court in US and there the education is less expensive for Masters, since it is one year only and lot of employment opportunities. \nAmerica will be the loser for each Masters seat evolving around $125000 per year as college fees. If there are no students for Masters Stem, there will be a loss of $ 31250000000 per year to USA with 250000 proposed foreign students.

They are not ready to study only bookish knowledge which can be got in their countries and through online itself. \nAmerica is survived by the people, skilled workers and big and large business and it is the duty of DHS to protect the US economy and US people by enacting rules/legislation like this. If this is not done by DHS, who will do?\nOPT Students also paid all the university fees without any funding from University or Government or from teaching assistantships, as any other US Citizens and OPT students are not getting any Social Security Benefits and nothing is free in this country to OPT students and Medical trust funds and please note not to deviate the fact that there is $0 for  Social Security for OPT students and they are contributing to US economy by paying TAX to Govt.\nH1B applications now is 210000 and the quota  for  MS Students is 20K and most of the Masters student did not get H1b this year. With scholarships in UK the future students, with 1 year most students will not come to US at all, if you will not imposing the rule for OPT extension\nIncrease H1b quota to 500000 per year and Masters quota to 200000 per year is in all fairness as the current lottery system is unfair and the H1B cap does not meet the demand. US is the land of equal opportunities and is poised for greater growth,\n\nAll the current students will go back to their country with the knowledge they gained by their education and US will be losing their talent and skills.\n\nIt is a false statement that more than 86K (jobs per year) of Americans are taken away and not supported by any stats and this proposed extension will ensure that no American jobs are taken away.\n\nPlease note that all the students are not selected for OPT and only STEM students from E-Verify companies are selected. Any opposition from other non stems students should be viewed separately from the rule and should not be studied along with this rule.\nAny degree without any concrete work experience/training is a waste of education. \nFirst year of OPT students gain very little experience and as proposed in the new rule, if the OPT should be extended for 2 years with guided and well programmed and monitored by employer and University( But with less paper or drudgery work for approval) for the students to get practical training.\nIf the rule is not implemented then US will be 20 years back in 5 years, with obsolete technologies/industry practices etc. and economy wild be badly affected.

It would help US continuously have a very good number of high quality international employees, who have been significantly contributing on the growth of economy (especially on high tech branch) in the States since years ago. Otherwise, the Companies would lose thousands of international employees next year, which would be a tremendous disaster for their operation and growth, especially for small business. Since there may not be enough qualified domestic candidates to hire in such a short time, as a result, not having this OPT extension may put the whole economy system in danger here in the States.\n\n2. United States of America, as we all know, is one of the most developed and most civilized countries in the world; not only because of  the right path those national fathers created a couple hundreds years ago, but also the spirits and values of this country Freedom, Justice and Diversity that built gradually generation by generation, which exactly is what their citizens are proud of. When I first came to the States, the director of the international office in my school, told me something like this: \"This country is strong as a thick rope, because she has been joined and being reinforced by high quality small ropes from different corners of the world. Therefore, we believe that the States will be as strong as they are with many high quality international components in the future.\n\n3. More working experiences for international students can be beneficial for both side: the students would get trained more and learn more skill before they head back their own country, which makes them more competitive to better contribute what they could and pursue what they are eager to for their life. On the other hand,  when they are back home, their \"USA\" working experiences can enhance business tie with USA when there is any business going on.\n\n4. With OPT extension, international student may be able to put what they have designed or developed into the market, create a startup, which may bring potential jobs in the near future.\n\nFor people like me,\n\nMy wife is currently an information architect at one of IT companies here in the States. Myself is a software engineer, just got my full time job offer and will start my work soon here. Without OPT extension, I only have one chance to try to win \"H1B lottery\"; if I am not getting it, I will lose my job after 12 months OPT. As a results, the whole burden will be put on my wife's shoulder to support the whole family, which will be too hard for her. Of course we can leave USA and head back home in that case, that way we both would have a job. But that decision can't not be made by myself, which is also too hard for both of us. Therefore, this OPT extension will be so important for us because with that, I may have 3 chances to get a H1B Visa. Also, a lot of things could be figured out with 24 more months.\n\nFrom my point of view, This OPT extension, will be surely beneficial for me, for people like me, but more importantly, for the whole country in both short and long run.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoqin LI, Rice University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2450", "postedDate": "2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n1. international students should have the right to take practical experience after they get education in U.S., otherwise the tuition and the time they take is wastes.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths.The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Goutham Kumar Chidhara", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2988", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the F-1 extension, cuz that give the company more opportunity to hire better emploees", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tingting Peng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13389", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I would really like for OPT to be expanded. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Charles Darwin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4910", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The OPT program was also designed to allow foreign students to gain work experience in their field of study that would help\nthem find work when they return to their home countries.

We all know that USA has the best industry filed among the world. Why student choose USA? I think most of them are attracted by the best education level and working chances here. Everybody knows the companies like Google, Apple and MS. Smart,excellent students come here, work hard and try their best to join these companies. They want to use their knowledge to make contribution to the world. And these companies can offer them the opportunity. It is because USA is the leader of the modern information technology revolution. But now, if the OPT extension is cancelled, students will have fewer chances to work here. Losing excellent students are the worst thing for a country. Nobody want to see that happened, especially USA, the leader country. \n\nSecondly, when we talk about American culture, it always come to my mind that the DIVERSITY is a very important tag. In the campus, you can see students come from all around the world. Most of them are very top students in their own country. They bring their knowledge as well as the good part of their culture. The American diversity is actually take advantage of this. But the question is, do these students have enough time to show their cultures, to make their country into the diversity of American's society? I don't think so. Only when they have chances to work at here, stay here, they can show more and more their cultures, especially the good part, which can make positive effect. \n\nThirdly, let's think about the situation if we don't have the extension. We know that projects in STEM fields always last long time, especially large, important projects. It happens that a project is in processing, but the researchers or the person who is on duty have used up their OPT. The main question is, IS ONE YEAR ENOUGH? Actually I don't think so. A new workers need time to make him or her into the new environment. Graduated students are not superman, they can't burn their all energies in one year. That's not practical. The more practical situation is, new workers get better and better by time. When they just get into their best status, they are told they can't stay in US, that is terrible, not only for the workers, but also for the companies. Both lose. \n\nLast but not the least, there are some people said that OPT students took their working chances because companies can pay low wage to hire F-1 students. I think this is ridiculous. Interns are treated evenly no matter where you come from. If citizens are good enough, they can use their skill to win the chance to get a job. Same as the international students. It is a fair competition. And also, we can think about this question in other way. International students bring the competition, which can push the citizens study and work harder. Is it a bad thing? No. \n\nThat's all my opinion about this OPT extension proposal. Again, I strongly support it.

Take my roommate Chen for example, he graduated from CMU last year with computer science degree, and now he starts his own computer company in Pittsburgh, and hires many local Americans. So international students might increase the job opportunities rather than compete jobs with local Americans.  \n\nLastly, the cut of opt extension may bring about a temporary relief, but in long term, it is bad for Americas predominance in many field, especially in high-tech field. What we can imagine is following situation: high-tech foreign employees were exiled to their homeland, as the result, the creativity and the innovation of native American company might decrease, and finally become less competitive in the world. What a could not be ignored fact is that, recently the booming of high-tech and internet companies is the result of there are increasing number of entrepreneurs with foreign advanced degree, most of them with master degree in Computer Science or other engineering related field.

So, requesting you to solve this issue by either increasing the H1-B count in THIS category or MODIFY the cap-gap rule so as to increase the number of chances a student could use to file for H1-B.\n\nI hope that the issues I mentioned are addressed in the final rule for STEM OPT.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nAnish Gupta", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anish Gupta", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0731", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Totally support the proposed rule.\n\nIt is fair to provide STEM extension of 24 months for the students who graduate from a university in USA.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Karthik Reddy Vavilala", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0766", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n\n1. STEM OPT extension provide excellent chance for foreign STEM students to get a better ideal on how the industry in US like. The whole ideal of STEM education is not only educate the best student, but also the best candidates for high-tech.If the knowledge from the school has no use, i.e., student CANNOT get enough practical experience, then the whole system is broken.For STEM students, working experience is also THE MOST IMPORTANT part of their education.That's why student like U of Cincinnati encourages student to get co-op and their students can beat those from UMich or Ohio State. \n\n2.STEM OPT extension provide good reason for foreign students to get a STEM degree and enhance the communication between engineers and scientists across the globe. With STEM extension, it is possible to build a strong connection between US high-tech industry to other major powers on Earth, such as China, India, and EU. This can build a strong bond between engineers and scientist from different background. The KEY ideal about this communication is the world is a whole, if a country hopes to survive and lead the world with little communication, that country is going to fail. With the help of OPT extension, students can get a degree and gain enough experience before they go back to the home country.That way engineers and scientists from different background will have more chance to start cooperation and make new technique advancement. This will only do good for U.S. economy. If companies in U.S. have little communication or cooperation opportunities with high-tech companies from other countries, it is hard to image how U.S. is going to keep its lead in technology advancement.\n\n3. It is a fact that many talented engineers and scientists in U.S. are actually not from U.S.. It is because U.S. was the best place for innovation, and that is all high-tech is about. A key factor that pushes this to happen is students from different background. If U.S. does not offer them the chance to study and gain practical experience, it would be possible for U.S. to have such a technology lead. This is because many break-through in technology actually comes from working and working is the place for exploration. Thus, if STEM extension is in place, students will have a better chance to help themselves to gain priceless experience and creating a better tomorrow for U.S.. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jiaying Gao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11392", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Extending OPT to 24 months is a great idea to improve US economy.

Increasing opportunities to high-skilled tech workers with advanced degrees is not a zero sum game as it is perceived to be.

I'm an international system engineermaster student from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at huawei, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China.

As an international student, I think I have rights to leave a comment. \n\nDuring seeking jobs and internship, I used to asked a lot of companies about their hiring standards. Take Palantir for example, the hiring standard is as follows: First, they will filter out those interviewees lower than a HIRING BAR, and then give offers to those interviewees who are US CITIZENS and US PERMANENT RESIDENTS, then OPT/H1B workers. Another example comes from Workday, another IT company, as is known to me(since I had an internship there), for most of the positions, international students are not preferred, since they NEED H1B SPONSORSHIP. \n\nSo according to this, those OPT students are not taking away jobs from US Citizens and US permanent residents, they have lower priority than permanent residents during jobs seeking. \n\nBut what if International students are given chances to get longer STEM OPT extensions? Personally I think it will bring benefits to United States:\n\n1. With such a 24 months extension, increasing excellent STEM students will be attracted to United States, thus improving U.S. academic standards in STEM, and benefitting US students respectively. \n\n2. Longer OPT extensions provide longer time for companies to examine the ability of international students. By such strict examination, the real talents can be selected as permanent residents, in this way they are able to help build United States, and create more job opportunities. That's just the target of immigration policies.\n\n\nSo, International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare for US citizens and PRs.

This tells us that international students are much harder to get accepted. Those selected students should be very talented at their field.\n\nSo international workers are not taking American jobs. But why this rule would be good to American society? Because America needs these talents. In academic field, a lot of great achievements were done by foreign students and faculties. They should have the chance to continue their research and contribute.

The argument made by some people that Americans will lose their work opportunities because of the new OPT STEM rule just cannot hold true. Their argument is equivalent of saying that US citizens cannot provide enough hi-tech workers, and need to let people with lower-quality skills to work by forbiding international talents. This is so short-sighted. A country without strong scientific and economy development will soon lose its advantages, which is the key for US to be the strongest country in the world. Without the first place, how can US market keeps providing enough job opportunities on the market? STEM rules allows a continuous vivid job market. Certain degrees of competition is not a bad thing. US citizens with hi-tech skills will not suffer from this rule, and people without high-tech skills now has more reason to improve their own skills to help their own country, rather than dragging it down.\n\nAnother important point is, F1 students benefited from OPT STEM also pay a lot of taxes. For those have stayed in the US for more than 4 years (which is generally true, as schools take 2-4 years already), they need to pay more taxes as they became residential.

I believe this proposal will first and foremost benefit American companies that hire international students who graduate from US institutions. When a person is hired, it would take time for him/her to get use to the hiring company's process. This company will also have to train them skills that are needed for their job. Therefore, the current total duration of the OPT and its extension of 29 months give the employee only two and half a chance to obtain the H1-B visa. Excluding the employee from working in the US after this 29 month period incurs significant cost to the US company, in terms of both the training expense for this employee, and the time to hire a substitute and the time and budget to train this new person. Meanwhile, expertise of the excluded person can benefit non-US companies.\n\nInternational students by no means has any advantages over American students. It is the other way around. American students obtain first-world education since young age, and they generally have better communication skill than their international peer. What international workforce bring to the US are skills that are needed in the market. My manager once said it is VERY hard nowadays to find a software engineer proficient in C++ (a programming language.) If an individual possesses such unique skills, would he or she accept a lower wage than his/her American peers?\n\nI do not believe any US companies would prefer international workers to American because they can offer them lower wage. Doing so would compromise their competitive position. The real danger to the US economy is that Americans would be unwilling to compete with skilled worker right inside the US; imagine how fragile the US economy would be. The trend of internationalization is omnipresent around the world. It helps create a healthier competition atmosphere and strengthen the position of US companies that adopts it.\n\nMore importantly, international employees share the same responsibility as Americans.

This is DESPICABLE! You people are supposed to represent AMERICAN CITIZENS...not political party and personal wealth and power!\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n    \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\n    On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\n    Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n  If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n    If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n    OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n\n    \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n    \"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nIt is a disgrace that corrupt politicians keep getting richer, and the American people keep getting screwed.

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Barbara Sherrill", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6782", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Another shameful program full of loopholes.

I feel pity for people like those declaring that international students are stealing their jobs or using the so-called extensions to trying to stay at the U.S.\n\nIt doesn't make any sense to me. First, students graduated from a STEM related filed are extremely popular job candidates everywhere. If one can have two to three years of practical working experience in a good U.S. company, the experience he or she would have is priceless. Many of those students don't even want to stay at U.S., but that doesn't mean they don't value the potential two to three years of experience in the U.S. Often times, if the student went back to his or her home country, almost every employer would prioritize those who have overseas working experience, not just overseas studying experience.\n\nThink about it this way, if all American college students are not allowed to work as interns, would that make it easier for them to find a job later? No, of course not, right?\n\nSecond, to be fair, I would agree that if an international student took over a job opportunity from an American worker because employer would pay less to hire the international student than to his or her American peer, that would qualified as a job stealing in my opinion. But that's never the case, STEM students got hired by big technology companies most of the time are treated just like their local peers, same salaries, same benefits and other employee perks. How could this situation to be seemed as stealing jobs from American job seekers? If one is really confident and qualified for a certain position, as much advantage as a native speaker already has in terms of communication, why would he or she even bother to have the fear of other international students could steal his or her favorite position?\n\nPerhaps those are just rumors, which I really hope so, but I believe the true beauty of this country is that it's built by the best people from all over the world.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Andrew Sun", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14988", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support DHS new rule of 24 months OPT stem extension.

Someone said that international students lower the salary level of whole country. I cannot speak for that. Indeed, some of positions are paid less, or even non-paid. If we don't take the position and put effort into it, then no one else would like to take it. Someone said that we are robber who rob job opportunity with native citizen. Well, about that, I have to say, yes. It is true because some of international students work harder than native citizen. They have higher efficiency and responsibility. A wise boss will pick useful employee who can make more benefits within shorter time. \nWe are glad to face competition. If we didn't win, we accept it. We will not complaint that our competitor grad the chance from our hands. Moreover, like I said before, if we quit, then some of positions such as computer related job, technology related job and business related job will be paralyzed because native citizen cannot undertake those burden. They still have time and energy to complain and fight against the OPT extension, which is also because of us. They can enjoy this society and the convenience of technology. Otherwise, they also need to get out of home and hunt for job. They dislike the group that they never understand. A country need cheaper labor and higher technical staff, if we are kicked out, will native citizen become cheaper labor? or higher technical staff? If they are able to become technical staff, then it will be great! However, most of computer science major and math major students are still international students. \nImaging that we do not have OPT. We learn the new technology and knowledge. But there is no place for us to use our knowledge. Some advanced knowledge can only be carried out by wise people and advanced technology, which is the reason why we need to stay here.\nTo sum up, we are doing jobs that native citizens don't like and some of them are not even able to do it. However they are still complaining that life is too easy for us, too hard for them. I would like to say one more sentence. Life should be hard. Life is harder than they think. They have a happy life but they don't understand.\nLife is never easy. If you think life is easy, it is because someone helps to undertake your burden. We take the burden. If we are kicked out, then the technology level of the country will be harmed a lot.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoyi Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17854", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the new 24 months STEM OPT extension.

It's certainly not a good thing for the colleges, and it would probably have a negative influence on the community economy too (few renters, few visitors, etc).

Anyone who works in STEM field would know that you need enough time to complete your invention. In most cases, one year is probably too short for you to even finish one project. With the extension, the students can spend more time on their projects, get good-quality work done and make more contribution to the companies or institutes, instead of getting interrupted when their OPT expire and having to leave when they are in the middle of something important. \n\n3. Nobody can ever STEAL the work from Americans. Just the opposite, the talented international students actually help CREATE more job positions in industry. For example we should know that the international talents have made enormous contribution to the rapid development of the Biotech industry. Quite a lot of them make great inventions when they are in school, and then run their own companies after graduation and start providing jobs for both US citizens and international students. Their efforts should be appreciated.\n    To sum it up, this policy would benefit hundreds of thousands of people and organizations, not only the international students, but also the US companies, colleges, and Americans in the STEM field.

Employees need to be focused to make progress in projects. 24 month extension means an enough period of time for students to join companies and do their best to contribute. With students' contribution maximized, the productivity of employers have a tendency to be better. If the OPT is only 1 year, the fully-focused time period to make progress is typically around half a year, with the rest time spent in training, logistics, getting used to the working environment, and again the logistics for the next step in career. This is very inefficient. Any company on earth is now trying to prevent employees changing jobs frequently. With only 1 year OPT, the frequent job changing pattern is inevitable. This is certainly not how resources should be used to achieve optimum. \n\nSecond, OPT extension is good for international students and not bad for US citizens. The extension gives F-1 students more time to learn and practice in US companies, thus make more contribution to US society as well as improving their own capabilities. This may increase the competition, since the demand for work is increased. However, the competition may also be decreased since international students are creating job opportunities through entrepreneurship. As for the existing job opportunities, the e-verify system ensures STEM OPT integrity. When students apply for positions, citizenship are not disclosed to employers, thus ensuring the employers recruiting applicants that meet their need. In this sense, the bar is set by companies, not by international students. The job opportunities are open to all eligible and qualified applicants.

These students are in their 20s, and it's their prime time of creativity and passion. They are devoted to working with the best talents in the US, creating breakthrough in technology and science, and making our life smarter and better. If you open any issue of Nature, Science, or other top journals of science, you will find these students in almost every article, if not in all of them.  \n\nSecondly, this regulation will ensure the best talents can stay in the US. The US immigration system is designed to retain the best of the best. OPT extension is not a permanent VISA; it only gives a brief period for the employers to see what the true value of an non-citizen employee. No employers will even try to keep an employee, if they are not great. Therefore, these OPT students just giving the employers more choices, who can potentially keep the best talents in the country. \n\nLastly, this OPT and OPT extension regulation is about American Dream. US is famous for its friendly immigration system, where it allows smart, hard-working people to live and thrive. The OPT and OPT extension systems gives an opportunity for students to demonstrate their value; and for employers to retain the best talents for the country.

I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out.\n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest.

I believe America has many individuals facing the difficulties to find a job but I also know that some companies are really in lack of workers they need. E-Verify is a very good program to protect local workers while solve such companies's shortage of workers.\n\nSecondly, even though international students are so lucky to find a job at an E-Verified company, it doesn't mean this company are willing to support H1B for the student. Only 65000 students can be granted H1B to work at US after the OPT period and they must be very talented. America doesn't need cheap labors but she does need talented individuals. I think STEM OPT + H1B lottery is the best way to pick those talents from tens of thousands of international students. \n\n65000 is a really really small number that hardly harms the local workers. But it does give many companies the opportunity to grow faster and be more competitive and help US economy.

OPT allows the training process during and after the education, which is vital in student's proper career development. However, the OPT would only last one year, which is not a long period, especially for STEM fields.\n2. OPT extension can attract more talented individuals to stay and contribute to US economy. It would be blind to oversee the need for STEM workers and experts. Most international students came to US to pursue advanced degree. Only when they successfully graduate will they be allowed to apply for OPT. OPT extension requirement is even more rigid. The students who are granted OPT extension are those who have demonstrated both ability and willingness to work in US. With OPT extension, US would have more chances to attract this well-educated population, instead of just ship them to home country like stowaways. Given the very competitive H1b lottery situation, OPT extension would be a good intermediate solution. Personally, I have seen some top class students who have used up OPT were forced to leave promising jobs merely because they were not lucky enough to get the H1b lottery. Ironically, they are now doing very well back in their home country.\n3. Granting OPT extension does not necessarily lead to less job opportunities for US citizens. The OPT extension rules make sure that all international students hired should be paid no less than similarly situated US workers. Also, they can only be hired when company cannot find suitable citizen for the job. It is obviously much more difficult to employ a student on OPT extension compared to US citizen. Some people may find the \"similarity\" definition vague. The case is, though many efforts have been made to boost the STEM education for US students including ERCs and tons of fellowships, there are still not enough graduates yet. \"Similar situated US workers\" have most likely been eagerly hired by some company. Therefore it is quite understandable that other \"less lucky\" companies would have to appeal to OPT students to fill their need. It is a false statement that there are not any \"similar situated US workers\". The more accurate expression should be: there are not enough \"similar situated US workers\", and that is why we need OPT extension rule.\nCompanies can function better and potentially generating more positions, as we have seen over the past years.\n4. US is a country based on immigrants. International STEM students who have proven be to competitive could be potential US citizens. As many countries are publishing laws to facilitate the immigration of high-tech personnel, it is unwise to do the opposite. US maintains its competition advantage by constant innovation, which are done by not only \"merely earlier immigrants\", but also new immigrants. We should not shut the door to people who are valuable to the future of US.\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tao Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19630", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "One of the keys that make this country prosperous is providing opportunities for international students and immigrants.\nI believe this regulation will keep American companies, especially these in IT industry, creative, productive and growing.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Erzheng Dai", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14014", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think the OPT should be extended for the following reasons:\n1) we are not taking away jobs.

F1s are hired on low wages and then treated miserably with lower increments, long work hours etc. and they do it as this is the only way they can stay in US. All that American dream stuff comes years later when they are already through their youth. Stop this extension ASAP as this encourages back door entry and companies are exploiting this practice. Students even after getting hired want to remain on OPT as this way they avoid social security taxes and only when their OPT is about to end is when they transfer H1B. Govt is losing so much on taxes because of the current extension itself and this exerts undue pressure on people who are paying these taxes. Has anybody in govt done this cost benefit analysis? Studying in US should just be considered as a upper edge than studying anywhere in the world and providing a US job after US study should not be guaranteed. Abolish this OPT and OPT extension asap to save jobs for Americans and residents.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lucky S.", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2038", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a great news for U.S. universities.

Our elected representatives are more concerned with providing cheap labor for The Chamber of Commerce than providing jobs for Americans.\n\n--OPT removed $4billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

For my personal experience, the flourish of US's high speed LTE network is a decent result of many international researchers who devoted 3-4 years in hard research works. Without 3-4 years of work, it is even impossible to understand the basic LTE specification, let alone making improvements. And US's leading position in medical industry is strongly contributed by PHD students in biology and chemistry field, the most of who are international-based students. However, it requires 3-4 years to make a sound and comprehensive progress on those fields, while seems impossible facing the original 1-year OPT regulation. The new extended OPT regulation gives them better chance to focus on those scientific projects without worrying about going home the next day.

So more time means more job opportunities, they can have more training on their major as well as service the US enterprise. That is a good thing! Both foreign students and US people can benefit from it.\n\nFurthermore, this extension policy is a good example of American tradition. As we know, America is a immigration country which allow people from different place come here and struggle to fulfill their American Dream in history. For the foreign students who wish to have job in US, they are brilliants, excellent and they have dream to service with more American people. Why we don't just give them this chance, give them more freedom to change their fate?\n\nSome people may worried about the foreign students would take off the job opportunities from local American. I understand but I still have to say that is no make sense. More high education degree people join the US market, they can give more power to the US economic. They make the enterprise more powerful at the same time more powerful enterprise provide more employment. And also, now is the global economic time, if US do not give them the chance, these excellent people can only return to their own country and server their own enterprise. Then this enterprise will really take off the job from the whole American people.\n\nSo in conclusion,   i think the extension of OPT is quiet a good thing. I hope every American people may consider this problem seriously. And I hope this time US can still show our proud American dream to the whole world.

Among them were F-1 students who could only work legally via CPT/OPT, and new H-1B employees who once worked under F-1 OPT while waiting for their H-1B lottery.\n\nThe proposed OPT extension rule is beneficial to American economy in many ways.\n\nFirstly, by granting OPT extension to qualified STEM students, we will be able to retain the most clever minds more easily. These people are crucial to the high-tech sector which accounts for an increasing proportion of our economy. Forcing them to leave America too soon would discourage companies from hiring them, and more importantly would send an unpleasant message to future international STEM students that America does not like them. Two consequences might follow: 1) students go back to their home country like China, and help our competitors grow; 2) American companies like Google shift their brain-intensive offices to more immigrant-friendly countries outside the US. Both scenarios are detrimental to our high-tech sector.\n\nSecondly, STEM students who choose to stay in America tends to have higher-than-average income, and thus spend more, which boosts other parts of the economy as well. Consumption is the engine of our economy, and with more money spent on cars, electronics, dining, clothing, entertainments, etc., more jobs will be created for Americans. Being aliens, they also contribute to the government by paying tax just as ordinary Americans do.\n\nThirdly, such a proposal helps our education stay competitive compared with other major education \"exporters\" like Britain and Australia. Students actually contribute a lot to our economy as most of them will have to pay full international tuition (even for state universities) and living expenses.\n\nThere might be voices against the proposal.\n\nFirstly, some may be concerned that these OPT students might compete for against Americans. It is true that finding a job is hard these days. But it is simply because the STEM jobs are intrinsically demanding, not because of the competition from OPT students. In fact, on a larger scale, we can see that we pay STEM employees (e.g. software engineers) a salary higher than almost anywhere else in the world. Price is an indicator of supply and demand, and this high salary implies that we actually have more demand for STEM workforce than currently available. Therefore, the STEM OPT students will not negatively impact the employability of Americans, as they are only taking jobs that would otherwise be left vacant.\n\nSecondly, some may worry that they have an intention to become permanent residents or even citizens. This may be true for a fraction of OPT students. But even in this case, if they can go through the strict immigration process of our country, then will have to show strong skills needed by America. They could only benefit the country. On the other hand, most OPT students will actually leave the country if they find it infeasible for them (e.g. if they find they cannot qualify for the high standards of our immigration system).", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qiurui He", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16044", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The US government should expand the visas to foreign students.

When the foreign students have graduated, they can only find jobs according to their majors. Besides, when a company has hired the foreign students, it must prove that this job can't find an american to fit it. So how can they reduce the job opportunities of the local persons when the jobs they found are those that cannot hire the local persons. So instead of competing with the local people, the foreign students are helping american economy because they are doing jobs that most of the local american can't do.\nThe normal 12 month(regular) and the extension of 24 months are very reasonable.

As we all know, it represents Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education, which is a crucial part in all education area. The students that spend several years and pay a lot of efforts on these majors all have the same objective, to make contribution to the society and the research area. Taking away their opportunities for using OPT extension means that taking away their chance of fulling themselves by working as part of American society.\n\nSecondly, one fact that no one can questioning is that employees with OPT extension is very important to various American companies. What kind of services are you using every single day? Using Google to search for information, driving Tesla to go to work, visiting Amazon to shop for products, browsing Netflix to watch movies, playing Xbox for Minecraft. There are uncountable instances of services you can think as part of your life, and the reason that these companies could have done their job so well is partially because of their employees with OPT extension. Taking away their opportunities for using OPT extension means that those companies will not be as good as they are for today.\n\nThirdly, American universities have been the students' top choice in a lot of countries because of the advanced courses and research opportunities provided by the universities, the work opportunities provided by the top notch companies and the unique culture atmosphere provided by the society. Could you imagine what will happen if the OPT extension policy is not available to those students in the future?\n\nPlease, consider these points and I sincerely hope that the OPT extension will continuously be provided to the STEM major students, not just for them, but for yourselves sake too.

The Optional Practical Training program is one of the selling point for universities/colleges in the U.S. to attract high quality foreign students from all over the world. If foreign students make a comparison between the U.S. and Europe regarding the high education systems, students are more willing to go to the U.S. because not only can they learn knowledge, but also they have much more opportunities to apply them in real life. I would imagine that stopping this program will jeopardize the reputation of the universities in the U.S., discourage students from choosing them.\n\n2. Foreign students (especially STEM students) have been (and will continue to be) a great help in the development of U.S.'s economy and industry. From the U.S. government's perspective, pushing them away, forcing them to go back to their home country is a short-sighted, unreasonable action. Look at the high tech companies in Silicon Valley, although being at the bottom level of the pyramid, foreign students/graduates are contributing in a dispensable way in these companies. High-end technology development will get stuck or even regress if these students/graduates are not allowed to work in the U.S..\n\n3. Different from immigration, OPT is a temporary working permit that won't cause too much trouble to the domestic labor market. Admit it or not, there are hundreds of thousands of job opportunities that cannot find U.S. citizens to fit in the positions. It is very easy to control the number of foreign employees by shrinking the number of H-1B petitions, so why not provide more opportunities to foreign students?\n\n4.

I believe in the following reasons:\n\nFor decades, the United States is deemed as the land of opportunities because it provides talented people a ground to pursuit their dreams despite which part of the world they are coming from. It is important to keep the doors opened to talented students after they graduate to find their opportunities despite their races and nationalities. Discontinued OPT regulation will lose many talented people and cause a bad impact to the US job market. Imagine all the international students that are in the work force right now are all gone, many of the companies will have a hard time to immediately find the suitable people, which causes a huge bad impact on the US economy. In the long-term, since many talented people are gone because of the discontinuation of the OPT program, the US job market will not be as competitive as before and the average salary will tend to decrease. Also, since it becomes more difficult to find talented people in the US, jobs will shift to other countries that could provide more talents. In the long run, there can also be a chance that international students may want to pursuit their degrees in other countries than the US that could provide more job opportunities after graduation. International students pay a large amount of tuition fee compared to local students. If all the US universities lose many international students, it could impact the US economy as well.\n\nIn contrast, the new amendment for extending OPT duration for STEM degree students will have a lot of benefits to the United States. This program could attract talented students around the world to pursuit degrees from prestigious schools in the US and maintaining the high rankings for US universities. The extended program allows talented students to have more time to find a job and contribute more to the US workforce. If they tend to work for longer years, it allows them more sufficient time to apply for H1B VISAs. The US job market will remain competitive which could attract more talents around the world. Companies can get good workers and continue to gain good revenues because of high quality products produced by high quality workers. The US economy will continue to prosper as long as the country collects the most talented people around the globe to stay and work in America. \n\nI sincerely hope that this proposal for extending OPT students will pass so that talented students around the world can have a chance to continue their dreams after they graduate. This can also help the US to keep top talents in the field of science and engineering in the job market. Thank you.

Firms go to schools to hire. The more technical the job is, the more education of the candidate it requires. In the field that I'm studying right now, many hiring firms only want master's and PhD students. As far as I know, many of the graduate students (master's + PhD) in STEM majors in my school (a math institute) are international students. My class has around 30 people this year, only 2 of them are native (this situation is not unusual at all for programs like mine). Guess what, our past placement stats show that jobs come usually easier for citizens. But that doesn't mean American students alone could suffice. The job market simply has the demand, and these are all highly technical jobs that require the best of the best. \n\nSecond, even if foreign students get a job offer right after graduation and work on their OPTs, they still face a very high chance of not getting H1-B eventually. The job market has its own filtering process; those who are capable get the jobs eventually. The goal of having the STEM extension is exactly that: let the job market choose the best talents--in a reasonable time frame.\n\nUltimately, it is these talents, native or foreign, that drive America's innovations, which in turn may very well change your life in a way that you could have never imagined.\n\nFinally, I think there are reasons why American firms (and American culture in general) dominate today's business world.

Three reasons are worthy of mentioning:\n\nFirst of all, the dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world for a long time. Therefore, the U. S. should give the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can continuously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industries could not have been so prosperous, such as information technology and computer science.\n\nSecondly, the diversity of the society is crucial and necessary. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. Moreover, the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings.\n\nLast but not least, someone argues that those international students create intense competition and take place of the job position in the U.S. In face, this turns out to be good time in the long run. The competition can push the majority of our citizens to enhance their skills and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. As we all know, citizens already have a natural edge when competing with foreigners since they do not need sponsorship and they have language advantage. we Should probably blame the elementary education in STEM instead of immigrants!

There are six strong reasons to approve the regulation.\n\nFirst, international STEM students have contributed significantly to both US economies and American people through tuition and living expenses during their study in US. The OPT extension is a big attraction for international students to invest the education in US instead of Europe, Australia, Canada, and many other countries. International STEM students spend their own money and contribute to US economy, which is the best business around the world and in history. Without OPT extension, less international students will come to US, which could seriously reduce job opportunities for the American people who make money from international students. Besides, US would reduce and even lose the leadership in education without the OPT extension.\n\nSecond, international STEM students have greatly contributed to the US technologies development. There is only a small fraction of US students who would like to pursue STEM major. Without qualified international STEM students, US research would be slowed down, and be caught up with by other countries. Providing OPT extension is a great way to attract qualified international students.\n\nThird, international STEM students have contributed significantly to US high-tech companies during their OPT and OPT extension period. There is not enough number of US citizens and permanent residents that meet the requirements of high-tech companies. As we all know, US high-tech companies lead the technology all over the world. International STEM students are strong thrust for the leadership. Without the OPT extension period, the trained STEM students would contribute to other countries, which are competitors of US technologies.\n\nForth, science and technology cannot be developed in one day or one year. For example, National Science Foundation usually allows a 3-year period for the research to be funded. A STEM graduate who just receives his/her degree has been well educated to devote to the science and technology. One year of OPT is not enough for international STEM students to make contribution to American science and technology. Most of work is usually in the intermediate stage after one year. If international STEM students have to leave US because of no OPT extension. It is not just the loss of the students, but also a waste of resources of US companies and US society. 24 months OPT extension is a good amount of time for STEM students to complete their job for US companies.\n\nFifth, the OPT extension regulation has provided enough protection for US citizens. It has been seriously considered in the regulation. Unqualified international STEM students cannot get OPT extension, even an OPT opportunities. Besides, US has faced STEM labor shortage long time ago according to the survey from industries and government. The number native STEM labor cannot meet the rapid development of technology and economy. Attracting international STEM students through OPT extensions have been proved to be an effective way to fill the gap of the STEM labor shortage problem without damaging native STEM labor.\n\nSixth, the top reason that US has been No. 1 in economy, science and technology is that US welcomes talented people all over the world to come to the US, to study in US and to work for US, no matter what their nationalities, race, color, gender, and etc. are. The OPT extension regulation is an importance step for US to maintain its leadership in economy, science and technology through attracting all talented STEM students around the world.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mingming Cai, University of Notre Dame", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18440", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this rule because this will benefit the US economy from several points below.\n1.

Those cashflow will in return improve the resources (books, courses, programs) and benefit domestic students. \n2. This rule will help STEM students work in tech field after they graduate for a period, this further help them learn the skills required in an industrial environment. In the meantime, their productivity is beneficial to US economy. \n3. There are many tech startups, middle size companies that need passionate students who don't care salary the most but the impact and passion towards what they are working on.

In this case, 2 or 3 years of a passionate and smart fresh graduates will fit in and help the company survive and thrive and further benefit the economy. I don't think this will affect domestic STEM graduates because there is strict rules that companies should give priority to domestic workers.

By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50 percent, from $4.4 trillion in 2012 to $6.2 trillion.\n3)International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the U.S. share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining.

My understanding of the many immigration enforcement-related rulings against the various states, have been supported by the opinion that \"Immigration is under the exclusive purview of Congress.\"  So, I am baffled by the various extra-judicial decrees made by this, and the former Chief Executive, concerning immigration.\n\nMy calculations show that extending STEM foreign-student status into a quasi-permanent immigration program (OPT = 3 years, H-1B = 6 years, AC21 extension = indefinite), will cause a 175.5 Billion dollar casualty to citizens and permanent residents in the form of shortening the useful lifespan of their STEM career.\n\nData from the National Science Foundation (1995 to 2004) indicates that an average of 389,818 Science & Engineering bachelors degrees (a sub-sector of STEM) were conferred to citizens and permanent-residents.  The Bureau of Labor Statics (BLS) reports that in 2005, STEM employment levels were at 5,228,040. With the aforementioned degree production, the entire STEM employment sector can be entirely replaced with citizen and permanent-resident S&E graduates in 13.41 years.  \n\nUsing S&E undergraduate degree production is an entirely fair proxy for estimating the talent vs. demand equilibrium because many STEM fields do not require science degrees and many Technical professions only require one or two year certificates.  Thus, we have established that the average lifespan of a STEM career in the United States is 13.41 years and the BLS reports that the average salary for STEM occupations was $64,560.00 in 2005.\n\nTurning to the National Science Foundation's data for S&E degrees conferred to nonresident aliens for the same period, we find that an average of 15,823 undergraduate degrees were conferred from (1995 to 2004). [1] Factoring these foreign nationals into the degree production vs. employment levels, reduces the average lifespan of a STEM career to 12.89 years.  The loss of this .52 years, equates to $33,571.20 per each STEM professional (2005) equals $175,511,576,448.00 in lost earnings to qualified professionals whom are already performing in their chosen occupations. \n\nDue to the fixed cost funding realities involved with many STEM projects, these professionals are often employed on fixed duration contracts and pressure from citizen and permanent-resident new graduates is fact of life and incumbents fight for regular employment, often on an annual basis.  Adding the economic shock of allowing non-resident alien competition into an occupational group where career options end at 35 1/2 years old, is not an appealing outlook for citizens and permanent residents contemplating studying for a STEM profession.   \n\n[1] The Institute of International Education (2014), reports that 38.6% of foreign students in the US are studying for undergraduate (bachelors) degrees and 42.3% are in graduate level programs.  Pro-immigration pundits are constantly touting the \"advanced degree\" aspect of skilled immigration, but never seem to respond to the suggestion of removing undergraduate degrees from their definition of \"advanced degree\".\n\nData sources:\nSTEM Bachelor degree data\nhttp://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf07308/tables/tab4.xls\n\nSTEM Employment data\nhttp://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2007/spring/art04.pdf\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9129", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support to the extension process.there is nothing like negative impact if this rule comes into existence, it would both it sector and the international students who come here to study.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sneha Kasturi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9852", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "My name is Chris, I got my IT Master degree in Valparaiso University on Dec 2013 in IN. \nI hope the Act of 24 months OPT replace 17 months can be accept.\n\n1.

I believe Congress created this \"false shortage\" by approving excessive numbers of F-1 visas to please Tech management to keep salaries low. \n\nAmerican STEM graduates should be fully employed before expanding F-1 the way you propose.

We get high education and far more advanced skills in technology. And the most important thing is that we really love civil and construction industry and we would love to make a difference in this field. After I graduated from Duke, I know I need to bring new technology into Construction Industry. I learnt new construction software(Oracle P6), BIM software and Blue Beam estimating software when I was at college. I really believe that I can help my current company shape the future by practicing my knowledge. And the 24-month Stem Extension will give me enough time to fulfill my expectation and it can definitely encourage more civil engineers working in their field and remodel the old construction pattern and introduce more advanced Technology to this industry.\nObviously, without the new OPT Extension , less students will choose Civil/Construction Engineering as their major or work in a construction company. It is definitely not something the Unites States wants to see.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Minyu Sun, Pwi Construction, Inc", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0196", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is going to hurt the quality of U.S universities if second term of opt does not go through.

What's the results ? All these people will go back to there home country or other countries they have more flexible and more welcoming regulations  for them. The harm may be can't see in one year , but in five years , America will pay a lot and lose a lot because of the cancellation of the OPT stem extension.\n\nSecond, the previous years' economy shows, the skilled and talented people have made huge contributions in this country, both in technology and innovation fields and this creates more jobs and opportunities for this country. In my university ,more than half of professors coming from other country. They excel both in teaching and researching. And they all have significant contribution in American industry. If canceling OPT extension, the education level in America will slowly fall behind of other countries. without new technology, America's industry will face another recession and in a long run it will hurt America and make more American citizen loss their job.\n\nThird, I don't think company hire non-citizen because of low fee. As I know all non-citizen students who got a job has the medical care and they share the same payment of the American citizen. Actually, companies have to pay more for hiring a non-citizen, like paying lawyer and other stuff. The reason why companies want to hire a non-citizen is just they have more value for this company and they excel other competitors.\n\nForth, this gives all people the fair platform to compete. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance and attract more professionals come to these country. If cancel the OPT stem extension, it's exactly contra the American spirit ! \n\nFifth,  it's gonna benefit American education. Longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study here. This will increase the revenue coming from the tuition fee. And a lot of students coming here means a lot of customers, this will indirectly help American's tourism and other industries and indirectly increase the American employment.\n\nIn conclusion, I support this new regulation. the people against this regulation only stand on their perspective, they  didn't thought about the benefits for the whole US and their opinion is contra human development trend.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tongtong Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11763", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support on keeping the extansion OPT of the STEM program.\n1.

While on the surface, therere jobs taken by foreigner students, there are huge potential and promises that foreigner students will create new jobs, make US more competent in global markets and contribute to the growth of economy.\n\nIve read both negative and positive comments. It seems to me that there are some misunderstanding about opt extension coming from the negative comments. First and most important point, the opt extension are not stealing jobs away from American citizens. A simple fact, we still have h1b cap, so the annual job assigned to foreigners are still the same, no matter the opt period is one year or three years. Second of all, the opt extension are just giving foreigner students more time to apply their skills learned from school into job markets, theyre not guaranteed to get the job position. Holding American citizenship still have huge advantages over foreigner students in job markets. There are lots of jobs requiring citizenships. Therere rules forbidding companies to provide low salaries to foreigner students in exchange for h1b visa. if an equally qualified American citizen and foreigner students get interviewed by company, there are no reason for companies to reject the American citizen ( cause the companies need to spend more money on filing h1b application .etc for foreigner students). I understand the anxiety that the young American graduates have. Since there are many excellent students coming from around the globe, the companies may be more willing to recruit those exceptional students. No offense here, its just that in order to get admitted into the US university, the students usually have very strong academic record in their own country. So this is really a question of how to improve the competence of american students in face of the incoming talents from around the world. Im not studying Politics or Economics, and cant give quantitative opinion about the benefits about competition. But I hold a belief that competition make the human society prosperous and function better. \n\nSecond, OPT extension is a program for eligible graduate students in STEM major, not illegal immigrants as mentioned in some negative comments. The graduates student are not wasting the taxpayers money neither. We pay tuitions ( in case of pursuing master degrees ) or providing academic services ( for example, make contribution to academic research, or becoming teaching assistant etc) to the Country, pay taxes as well as American citizen holders do if were working. The immigrants have made and are currently making lots of contribution to the country. Will job markets, economic environment, the country as a whole become better for native US citizens simply by rejecting talents from the globe? Its doubtful. So why do foreigner students need opt extension? Its dated back to the days when h1b lottery began. Each year there are only slightly more than half-half change for a master degree and above degree holders to get h1b visa. The original OPT period is around one year, without filing the extension, many STEM fresh graduates students dont even have the chance to file h1b application. In that case, they are forced back to their own country without any working experiences.  A degree comes from a foreign country, no working experiences will put those students in dilemma, theyre hard to find jobs in their own country no matter how well their academic records indicate. If opt extension gets cancelled, the global students will definitely reconsider about applying for US universities. The effects of that should at least be added to the consideration list.

Think about the cost for an organization to hire an international student versus an American student -- the cost of hiring a lawyer and filing for job visa can easily cost a company more than $6,000. So it's actually cheaper to hire a U.S. citizen. When companies decide to hire an international student, it's always because he/she is better qualified for the job, and the company sees more value in investing in him/her. As the government, you shouldn't listen to the complaints from people who can't find a job (they can't blame others for being more competent), instead, listen to what companies are saying.

They've seen how the tech companies and science discoveries (science and technology) benefit people's life; how high-end engineering parts (engineering) influence their procedures of making machines; and how the healthy financial strategies (Math) facilitate their way of making business. These developing countries want to build a similar financial and industrial system in their land, so they are trying their best to attract their citizens (studying in US) back and foreigners in to help them develop.

Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees.\n \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\n \n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\n \n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\n \n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\n \n \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\nRakesh", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rakesh Ramesh", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2945", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposition not only because it benefits the international students, but also because it will bring great advantages to the US economy.\nThe extension of training opportunities is a great way for international students to apply the skills that they learned here to boost the US economy.

I heard anti immigrant US citizens have made many complaints concerning the OPT. As a Chinese Biology major, I do not think my happiness or future plans will be much of interest to those anti immigrant folks. You may be the angels busy helping African people under poverty line to get food and shelter; you may be the heroes busy fighting terrorist ISIS in faraway lands; your compassion may drive you to welcome Syrian refuges as they flee their war-torn homeland.\nBut some of you would not consider giving a tiny bit more opportunity for talented foreigners who envy your country freedom and strong system, and want to fight for you, help boost your economy with technology, and at the same time pursue their own dream (Most of the biology advances happen in the US, you have so many great companies here).\nThe reason is simple. Some anti immigrants think us as a threat. A threat to your culture, and a threat to your jobs. Ignorance comes from two sources: One you are just uninformed. Two you bias and choose to listen to one voice only, the one that fuels your anger, your selfishness and your aggressiveness. The voice of the animal human rather than the rational human.The later, no words will be able to convince them of the truth. This is not for them.\n2. Are we a threat to the US? \nI am no more threatening than an anchor baby. I am healthy, young, intelligent enough, I have the similar values as you do. I am quite \"international\".I lived in Europe and Japan for some years, and in China for some more years. I love the US, for the fairness of its system, for hamburgers and everything else. I feel happy living here, compared to the highly competitive China and its sick bureaucracy.\n3. Is STEM OPT beneficial? \nHSD has made it very clear in its proposed rule. Here I mention some in my own simplified view.\nJOBS: Your jobs will not be taken by us. Economy is a cake that increases if people are creating values, and the surplus of values we create will increase jobs.AND needless to say, OPT is for STEM,the areas in which US needs tons of new blood. We are just filling the holes. \nTECH:And if incompetent people are chosen instead, could the US still possibly be leading the world research area? I think I don't have to repeat the importance of science and technology in the 21st century. \nEDUCATION: can be benefited by more legal STEM immigrant, especially maths. \nHEALTH:related to Biology STEM students\nU.S:Immigrants have built your country, and we are here to build it even stronger, so that America keeps its title of the fittest country on the globe. A civilization can deteriorate, just like your fresh orange can grow molds, and ONLY IF it can self-renew, and keep its doors open, can it live for longer. China Qing dynasty shut its door to western civilization as well as their science and technology,and they perished in the opium war,left its citizens weak and dumb, unable to fightback when confronted to Japan during the next hundred years. This is told in every Chinese history textbooks.\n4. OPT IS GREAT BUT STILL NOT ENOUGH.\nYou may think the road to citizenship as: we get an OPT,then a job and poof we are citizens. I have always thought the road to citizenship in the US as a really difficult one, for those not lucky enough to be born in the US territory. \nHow to expect to be treated fairly in a country when you are not a citizen? The laws doesn't protect you as much, and you are constantly being rejected in job interviews by requirements such as \"US citizenship\"or\"Green card\". And you find it unfair that good jobs that you find yourself competitive shuts their door because they chose the citizen applicant.The irony is, to become a citizen you require a job, to have a job in STEM you'd better be a citizen and more than that your job title cannot be changed during years unless you want to reapply.\nYou find out that, if you do not have blood relations to a citizen, you do not marry a citizen, and you think you can become a citizen based on your scientific competence in STEM area, you will be upset when your road to citizenship take up to a quarter of your life time . While there are \"anchor\"babies there who gets citizenship right away (I am relieved some US people still think they should simply be called babies rather than anchor babies), and even illegal immigrants who gets a chance in citizenship. Even more adding to the difficulty, the pool from which green cards are randomly issued is divided into nationality categories. And you imagine Chinese pools.  \nBut then I understand the opposition. I understand why being a US citizen is so difficult, it's because this is a great country, and although my life will probably be committed to \"wait and pray and hope to be a citizen\", I'm still happy with it.  \nI still hope we can be given more chance, and hope OPT can be prolonged for 7 little more months.

I graduate as a law student, I don't benefit from this proposal, so I have pretty objective on this proposal. \n\nFirst, you can simply ask those high-tech companies whether the extension of OPT is a great idea. I bet 90 percent them will support it. There are too many international students who specialized in math, computer science and any other related subjects commit a large part of efforts to those high-tech companies. But since recently, getting a H-1 visa has been as difficult as wining a lottery for international students, how would those talented students stay, and contribute their efforts to America. The extension of OPT will help a lot, and provide them more chances to \"win that H-1 lottery.\" Besides, the United States benefit from the extension of OPT in the long run. Instead of allowing talented students to work in a competitor company in another country, why not keep them for ourselves. If they can bring more revenue, and strength our country in scientific, economic and educational field, why would we still stubbornly focus on there nationality. Some people dislike the proposal cause they are afraid that international students will occupy their labor force. However, If you are really talented and knowledgable American, why are you afraid of the competition from international students whose first language are not even English!\n\nSecond, the Constitution tells us that \"the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America\". If the \"people of the United States\" indicate all people, no matter what nationalities, who come to United States because of their longing for the freedom and justice, which I believe most of people do so, they should be treated with justice and equality. How could that be equal if they couldn't even be allowed to work at America due to their legal status. But if the \"people of United States\" merely indicate the American citizens, that means only the America citizens can be treated equally and work wherever they want without limitation, but the international students cannot? In that case, is the Constitution of United States of America still deserve the perfect symbol of freedom and justice which is yearned by people all around the world?\n\nWith the reasons above, I believe the 24 months extension of the OPT for students with STEM subjects should be granted.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Stella Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13297", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT STEM Extension is a great thing for both international students and America.\n\nA large portion of PhD students majoring in STEM areas are international students and they have made tremendous contribution in various research area. For example, in the ECE department of my university in Alabama, almost 80% of PhDs are from abroad. The academic publications written by international students occupy 80% of the total publications. Without OPT STEM extension, less and less international students would come to the US which is a big loss to America academic society. Considering the complexity of STEM majors, studying purely in the university is not enough for international students to build solid background for their future career, and OPT STEM extension offers international students the opportunities to fill the gap between school and real industry. Without OPT STEM extension, at least I personally would not choose US for graduate study. \n\nI admit that canceling OPT STEM extension would offer more job opportunities to America-born students, in the short term. In the long run, as less and less talents come to study in the US, I dont believe America would keep this fast trend of increasing its economy and developing its technology. At that time, who knows how many job openings would be there for American citizen students majoring in STEM areas. Sometimes, people just have to think what would happen in the future without OPT STEM extension. \n\nThe below story is quoted from the publication of NASA which is named why explore space?, and can be used to support my statement of supporting OPT STEM extension. In the short term, townspeople below would get more bread from the count by stop supporting the Strange Man, just like American citizens would get more job opportunities by canceling OPT extension for international students. In the long run, there may be no microscope invented for the townspeople and America.\n\nBelow story quoted from NASA publication \"Why Explore Space?\"\n\"About 400 years ago, there lived a count in a small town in Germany. He was one of the benign counts, and he gave a large part of his income to the poor in his town. This was much appreciated, because poverty was abundant during medieval times, and there were epidemics of the plague which ravaged the country frequently. One day, the count met a strange man. He had a workbench and little laboratory in his house, and he labored hard during the daytime so that he could afford a few hours every evening to work in his laboratory. He ground small lenses from pieces of glass; he mounted the lenses in tubes, and he used these gadgets to look at very small objects. The count was particularly fascinated by the tiny creatures that could be observed with the strong magnification, and which he had never seen before. He invited the man to move with his laboratory to the castle, to become a member of the count's household, and to devote henceforth all his time to the development and perfection of his optical gadgets as a special employee of the count.\n\nThe townspeople, however, became angry when they realized that the count was wasting his money, as they thought, on a stunt without purpose. \"We are suffering from this plague,\" they said, \"while he is paying that man for a useless hobby!\" But the count remained firm. \"I give you as much as I can afford,\" he said, \"but I will also support this man and his work, because I know that someday something will come out of it!\"\n\nIndeed, something very good came out of this work, and also out of similar work done by others at other places: the microscope. It is well known that the microscope has contributed more than any other invention to the progress of medicine, and that the elimination of the plague and many other contagious diseases from most parts of the world is largely a result of studies which the microscope made possible.\"\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Hoe", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17746", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I really think the policy is so good.\n\nFirst it can be a very important reason let good students choose to study in USA from all over the world, this can let the American culture be more diversity.\n\nAnd this can let company hire better students with low salary. and also can let students get good work experience in USA.\n\nThis can be a profit for USA government spends so much money on student.\n\nSo I can not agree more with this policy!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhibo Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17170", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is really beneficial to US economy to hire STEM major employees.

It is against the interest of academic sectors not to extend OPT for STEM students. \nWhen I was applying to pursue an advanced degree (Ph.D. in Biostatistics) in the U.S., the opportunity of getting work experience after graduation is an important factor that I considered. As in order to fully understand and learn the knowledge in my field, getting practical training is very necessary. Compared to other foreign countries, U.S. has provided international students with more opportunities for working in its country (with 12+17 months OPT and H1-B) and only with certain years of work experience can I improve my competitiveness when I come back to my own country. One of the reasons that U.S. universities and institutions could be top in the world is because its diversity. They could admit the most intelligent students in the world not only because of their education , but also because of the beneficial OPT policies in the past several years. With a very short OPT and very competitive H1-B lottery, U.S. academic sectors will lose a lot of talented students in the world. \n\n2. I don't think extending OPT will make employers lower their payment as I personally will not find a job that offers me salaries that are below average and I think most of my friends and classmates will not do it either. It's just simply because offering low salaries will not be attractive as we have better choices. As far as I know, no one has found a job that has salaries below average simply because they wanted to work here. Some even decided to come back to my own country right after graduation because they have sought better opportunities.

He invented, developed and commercialized the Insulated Gate Bipolar Trannsistor (IGBT), which is extensively used in the consumer, industrial, lighting, transportation, medical, renewable energy, and other sectors of the economy. It has enabled enormous reduction of gasoline and electrical energy use, resulting in huge cost savings to consumers, and reduction of world-wide carbon dioxide emissions. He received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the highest form of recognition given to an engineer by the United States Government, from President Obama in October 2011, at the White House. Companies like CSR Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive, TSMC, ROHM, Fuji are completing with US companies particular in this field. Imagine, if there is no OPT. Foreign talents like him will go back to India, Japan or China and develop the new technology ahead of US tech companies and create more jobs in other counties. US will lose the leading role in this cutting technology and lose the chance to create more jobs for US citizens. \n\nNot only Dr. Baliga, but also many other professors, who are from foreign countries, are making great contributions and create more jobs to US. Examples like Dr. Mehmet Ozturk from Turkey, who is a IEEE fellow contributing to Silicon and Silicon-Germanium Epitaxy in Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Integrated Circuits, which is crucial to the advancement of computer technologies.

Imagine, if there is no OPT, less and less foreign students will come to study, no such or much much slower speed of developing these manufacturing technologies will be, and there will be less and less jobs for US citizens.

If international students can't work in those companies, it will affect those company much and affect US economy as well.\n\nThirdly, OPT-extension is for STEM students.

So Software Companies can't hire the right American or can't hire enough engineers to support their business. That is why they want to hire many international students.

I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.\n\nIt is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries.

Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule.

There are a few major objections 1) There are lots of American out of jobs, they should be considered first 2) It's already been a touch time for American students finding jobs after graduation 3) Companies like to hire OPT holders, as they are cheaper. \n\nFor 1), we are talking about STEM students. The jobs for them require specialities in certain areas with master or ph.d degrees. For those who lose jobs, which is unfortunate to me too, probably need to think whether you can fulfill the job requirements before whining that why the jobs were not granted to you\n\nFor 2), if one really goes to the job market of new grads,  you'd find how American students are preferred. Companies do not need to hire professional attorneys to work on various cases of immigration issues, which cost the companies big. I've never heard a single word that because the interviewee is a foreigner, he/she gets privileges in getting a job offer, at least not in any of the good companies that American students would like to work for.\n\nFor 3), by law, companies need to show they pay no less than American employees when sponsoring working visas for foreigners. For not paying SSN and medicare, the so-called saved money go to the employees own pockets, instead of returning to the company. And it's legit for the OPT holders not to pay them, as they are not getting any benefits out of them either. If they ran out of their OPT time, they will need to leave the country. What rationale is there to enforce them to pay SSN and medicare. Once they become H1b holders, they start to pay the two taxes right away, don't they? \n\nWhat's not fair here?

As a postdoc working in a University, the VISA problem is not as quite urgent for me as for those who need H1B to work in industry. I appreciate that the current policy allows me to work here with OPT STEM extension for a total of 29 months. However, a real productive postdoc experience usually cost at least 3 years, especially when this is in biological science, which usually requires more work and time to finally get to some convincing result. Thus, during a usual postdoc 3-year contract, a foreign postdoc and his PI, as well as the institute, at a certain time, will always need to find a way to maintain his/her VISA status, which usually means H1B or J1. \n\nBoth of them are unnecessarily painful.\n\nH1B application is expensive. This expense is either covered by the funding of the postdoc's current lab, or by him/herself. With tightened funding these days, this >$3000 application fee is a big burden to any lab and would eventually prevent the hiring of foreign postdocs, which, to be honest, takes up to half of the postdoc population in US and is a great resource of good science and great future scientists. For this expense reason, and to avoid the complicated legal process, more and more institutes/universities stop to offer H1B to postdocs. They turns to J1 VISA, which is a disaster for postdocs from China. \n\nThe treaty between China and US requires the J1 holders to return to China AND STAY THERE to serve for 2 years before they pursue for another foreign experience. Yes, you can waive the must-return duty, (one time in their whole life), but the waiving process, a frustrating business dealing with local offices back in China while the personnel is in US is just time and energy consuming. The whole process takes at least 6 months, during which time, their spare time will be occupied by those non-sense paperwork instead of meaningful research works. If a postdoc has a choice of their VISA type, I bet most of them, if not all, would like the H1B VISA. \n\nAnd let's be realistic, is there anyone holding a H1B VISA not want a green card? Even if they did not, once they have the H1B, they will start to want the green card. This is the reality. Why is that? Because they hate their own country? No, it's simply because you offer them another option. No one refuses an extra option.\n\nIt doesn't have to be like this. \n\nGiving a 24-months STEM extension is a perfect solution for both side. A total of 3 year of OPT allows the trainee to complete their projects, without putting more pressure on immigration. It avoid unnecessary spending on applying a VISA from the research fund. It allows the trainee to concentrate on their work and have the achievement both themselves and the research in US need. When they finish their three year experience, they would be more confidence to go anywhere in the world instead of sticking themselves to working VISA or green card. \n\nIt would bring a lot more energy into the industrial research as well. Since the H1B VISA application is a pain and depends largely on luck (a draw, seriously? (A HR spends days on searching for a suitable person and another days with lawyers on the VISA application, and then the person does not have the luck in April draw? What a waste of time and work!), many companies refuse to offer H1B VISA while they actually urge for employee with quality. Why not ease their life?\n\nI think I have said too much here. All-in-all, a 24-months STEM extension is a win-win policy, or a \"win-win-win' for the trainee and US research society, and for relieving the immigration pressure, too.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Hana Sue", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18714", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree this change from 17 ope extension to 24 month.\n\nI think it is a good way for US to attract lots of outstanding foreign students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Andrew Tu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0351", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The Department of Homeland Security is charged with protecting American citizens, not with helping multinational corporations drive down American employment and wages in favor of foreign nationals.

The government should give international students opportunities of applying the knowledge they learn from America to the society, which is also to let them make contributions to America after their study. They are a part of the best students all over the world, and the government provides the best higher education to them. It is a waste to let them immediately return to their countries after their study, instead of staying in the US and contributing to the development of the technology of the US.\n\n2. I don't think the OPT STEM extension will have bad effects on finding jobs for US native people. Because it is much more harder for foreigners to find jobs than US native people. Native people have many advantages: they have no communication diffculties caused by the language; their ways of thinking are what most companies need; they are very familiar with the culture and have large social networks, etc. Thus they are accessible to many oppertunities that foreign students are never able to reach. And they have much more advantages and competitiveness than foreign students to find a good job. So they have no need to worry about the problem that foreign students may seize their job opportunities.\n\n3. This proposal can create a lot of new job opportunities. Because many international students want to start their own business. And there is no doubt that the US is the best place to achieve their dreams. Many big companies in the US are created by international students, like Nvidia. The start-up companies create many job opportunities for local people, and make big contributions to the development of the technologies and society of\nAmerica. And the OPT STEM extension can give them enough time to start their business up.\n\nIn sum, we should support the proposal without hesitation. The US is a country with diversification. It gives all kinds of people accesses to their dreams. And it gives all kinds of people equal opportunities of hard working.

Instead we need it stopped.  By replacing Americans and bringing down wages thru out the country you all have been proved to be Benedict Arnolds.  All of you who promote this outrageous lie.  I am an I/T web developer whose has seen my wages stagnated while internationals, legal or illegal, steal them from me with the help of corporations in power and their puppets (IE: the President) they control in government.  So what are you going to do, give me the informed answer not the lies you prefer to put out there, that would be nice for once.  Yes, I am not being very respectful but then only those who have earned it deserve it.  So lets get into it...\n\nI know plenty of American students who are coming out of college with awesome grades, even some with master degrees like my own son.  What is going to happen to them if they are not able to get positions while owning on large amount   student loans?  Why are you replacing these American citizens who are coming out of college when only 25% are actually getting jobs in the STEM areas of their studies due to other rules similar to this one ?  This rule will certainly keep them out of those jobs.  \n\nWithout jobs / positions they will not be able to pay these loans back, their futures destroyed by their own nation, their own corporations greed.  Why should they end up working for McDonald's when they are educated and have better grades then those who do not ?  My son is at the top of his class, top grades far better then any of the internationals student who attend the same classes with him.  \n\nWhat are you going to do about companies like Disney, Dell, SEC of California and so many more that hire these cheaper wage internationals?  The corporations actually replace Americans who are then forced to train them as replacements ?  Is this the future our children should expect from their nation ?  Yes, they are part of the greater picture in which our country replaces Americans with outsiders.  Surely this is a sign that the internationals are actually not needed in our nation?  Why is our USA government actually supporting such actions against their own young or older well educated native citizens?  We are definitely smart enough to figure out what is happening here, believe on this point !!!\n\nWhy is our nation selling us out?  We are all linked together, we are American sisters/brothers being forced to suffer in our USA nation ?  I demand as an American citizen that you stop with the lies when the truth is out there for all to see.  Unemployment in this nation is at the highest rate in year even since the year of 1977.  Unemployment for many in our communities is rocking into the sky, the worst it has been in like 50 years or near there behind this President and his administration and their controllers in business and financial institutions like Wall Street.  \n\nWomen and young people are the largest groups who are suffering today, so I ask why our / their suffering is not more important then it is in our own nation ?  Our social systems are becoming over whelmed by so many individuals in need of them.  My youngest child is on welfare, Snap/food stamps, while she struggles to get a job though she is educated as well.  Why is her struggle not important to this puppet President and the corporations that push him to do such actions her ?  Why is the fact that she goes hungry and homeless not important to this same man, same group ?  Not able to pay on her student loans in the process ?  Her own nation is driving her into being a joke and destroying any thought she may have had this was a great nation willing to give her a shot at that gold ladder that leads to success, why is this happening to her, to us ?\n\nAmerican's workers and children are suffering behind this man, his corporations and this government which is no longer interested in us that is a well known fact.  Most Americans that walk on the streets of this nation understand this fact too.  Why is our President and his government etc. not helping us survive this situation ?   Welfare is not the helping hand that is needed, no not at all.  Why do they continue to support these acts used against our becoming successful and high functional citizens ?  Do they not want good citizens ?  Seriously, what is their problem ?  Why are they throwing us under the bus with so little regard or with no support ?  This is in fact the definition of a Benedict Arnold, a traitor when we are not even allowed to make a living with the support of a good government but instead get a government full of leaders who work to bring about our failure instead.  Why do we not have the type of government that is a supportive one ?  Why have you all taken the position of Dark Vader, the dark force, in this scenario ?

But, they absolutely do not pose that many obstacles for internationals to find a job and work in Japan.

Without OPT, campus life is almost all the university here can provide to an international student, which is far from enough for those potential bachelors,masters and doctors who are preparing themselves for their future career. I am pretty sure if this rule is rejected, U.S. will be much less attractive for students all over the world. Somebody says there is one year for you to practice. I think everyone knows what one year means in the real industry. Right now I am working in an machine vision company. Our schedule is pretty tight so our team have to finish our current project by the end of 2016... Within one year, nothing serious can be finished. So OPT extension is more necessary many people thought it would be. Other than this, I think it is reasonable to give more opportunities to students majoring other fields, such as economy and art. In this diverse country, people from all over the work have done terrific job in multiple files. More friendly policy will definitely make U.S. much more developed from all the perspectives.

However, I'm disappointed by comments from many citizens who lack 'the big picture' and only see 'unfair' competition. Please read the following:\n\n\n* On immigration in general (it's not that simple):\n\n- http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy\n- Economists generally agree that immigration is beneficial, let alone high-skilled immigration which is generally considered as a 'no brainer'. Perhaps some individuals stand to lose but the economy overall is better off. (lengthy discussion here but that's the essence. do your research)\nNote that I'm not picking topics that simply advocate for liberal immigration policy\n\n\n* On attracting high-quality students (US gets the best):\n\nThe US (so far!) attracts some of the best talent the planet has to offer especially at the graduate STEM level. They are young, intelligent, full of energy, and many look forward to a permanent presence in the US. Sure, like any immigration benefit, it will be abused. Mediocre students are surely going to take advantage of this benefit. However, that is not an excuse to limit or eliminate the benefit.\n\n\n* Connecting with broader immigration reform (US does not accommodate the highly-skilled):\n\nThis regulation is another bandaid from the executive branch since Congress refuses to act on immigration reform. Perhaps there should be some provision to stop the STEM extension if foreign/alien/non-resident students are able to obtain a more appropriate work authorization once passed (?) by congress.\n\nOn the other hand, the US lets in some ONE MILLION people every year on a permanent basis. The vast majority came in on some family-sponsorship which is a relatively straight forward procedure. My point is that these (legally considered) immigrants did NOTHING to earn the privilege to come to the US. They do not face the red tape that US-educated, hard-working, and highly-skilled people go through (F1->F1-OPT->H1B->green card). \n\nAnd don't get me started on the talk about legalizing the 11 million undocumented/illegal immigrants.\n\n\n* My motivation in writing this (I might not even get initial OPT):\n\nI've accumulated a 17 year presence in the US on temporary visas spanning my childhood and into my adulthood. That's grades 1-6, a double major STEM BSc, most of a STEM PhD (exited with a MSc), and a second STEM MSc. Without much professional experience, I've gotten interest from employers working literally in the national interest of the US. Yet, as I finish my second MSc, USCIS my not give me the benefit of the doubt in my particular situation and issue me a second initial OPT period.\n\n\n* :\n\nAfter all this time, I do appreciate the chance to comment here as a 'foreigner'. Upon leaving the US, I will practically have no other professional avenue to come back with. But if feels great to leave my .02.\n\nSincerely,", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Majid al Dosari", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2897", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US.

Second, due to the conversation I had with multiple HRs from Tech Company in the pass, the truth is, when they are looking at candidates, US citizens is prioritized to hire, only if US citizen cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. And those tech companies is risking potential loss of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles?. \n\nSo, if those people really need something to worry about, this is what they are supposed to worry about: why not spending more time improving their own skills set those companies are looking for instead of wasting time leaving negative comments here?

It is not obvious to most people. But think about what if some international students working on a medical research for years but cannot keep working on it all of a sudden. It will not only be a huge loss for the company, the research organization, and the government, but also affect every American citizen.\n\n2. OPT STEM extension will not lower the wage for full-time job for American citizens. OPT is for internship! It is normal to pay lower for internship than full-time job all over the world. However, once it turns into full-time job, it makes no difference between international students and American citizens.\n\n3. A lot of companies have nothing to do with OPT extension since they are not e-verified. I noticed that many people mentioned they get lower paid in companies like Disney because of students with opt extension. However, neither Disney animation studio nor disneyland is e-verified! To get the extension, a student has to be in STEM degree and the company he/she works for has to be e-verified at the same time. I'm pretty sure not many US citizens realize it.\n\nI am international student but I have lots of American friends. They are nice and we help each other in study and in daily life.

At the time when I applied graduate school, I also considered schools in UK. There are some of the world best universities in UK and most of them are one-year program. If I just want to attend a prestigious school, get an Master degree and then go back to my country to find a job, why don't I choose schools in UK? Apparently, OPT gives me an option to work in US and it's extension can guarantee me to legally stay in US until I get an H1-B visa. The work experience in US makes me more competitive candidate in job hunting back in my country. That's why I would rather to choose graduate schools in US even though it is more expensive and it requires more years to complete. It costs me more than 100k dollar to finish my degree(including tuition fee, housing, food and any other consumption). If it was not because of OPT and its extension, I would definitely choose schools in other country such as UK, Japan or Australia. I will also not recommend my friends and cousins to go to schools in US. I don't care about the location the school is in as long as it offers quality education(if I go back to my country as soon as I graduate). Why spending more money and more time to go to a school for nothing extra? It's not wise. Think about it. If the extension is canceled, thousands of students like me will choose other countries for further study, which means more cash will go to other countries. Schools in US will earn less, which may cause many actions(like rising tuition fee for locals). If there is 24-month extension for STEM students, schools in US still have the most competitive policy against other countries and US will still be the first choice for us.

Here are my points.\n1. The reason I came to the U.S. to study, instead of other coutries, is the U.S. provides better training opportunities to foreign STEM talents. In fact, there has been and will always be huge demends of foreign STEM students to support most US STEM companies. Without OPT, It could be a disaster for US hi-tech industry.\n2. The U.S. has a convention of absorbing talents all over the world. It is the same as she was doing from 18th century to build this empire with advanced immigration plan. Typically, most foreign STEM students can go through over 24-month projects with 12+24 OPT which means great. If OPT is too short, most projects would be severely hurt and even aborted.\n3. Better training opportunities will bring more foreign STEM student studying in the U.S. and increae local house renting income for native americans. Take example from my landlord, he seriously hopes more foreign students, especially Chinese students rent his house. He is actually working in Barclays Bank in Manhattan, so he has to move to the City leaving his New Jersey house rent.

Some claim that OPT holders take the jobs from the US labor. However, this is groundless. The annual report of \"The Survey of Earned Doctorates\" (SED) on Science and Engineering Doctorates from NSF (see attached table) shows that US undergraduates and graduates have a better chance to get a job after finishing their academic work than international students, from either industrial or academic fields. The proportion is higher in STEM as well. If one is comparing senior US labor versus international fresh graduates, for the same job, it is obvious a senior US citizen takes advantage over the latter. Further, suppose both a US citizen and an international student are offered the job. If a US citizen thinks the wage is too low and rejects the offer, while the international student accepts it, the US citizen must have a better choice as a reasonable person. Therefore, international students as so-called \"cheap labor\" cannot rob the job opportunity from a US citizen who maybe has a higher standard. It is usually the case that the US citizens pass the opportunity to their international counterpart simply because they do not want to take it.\n\n2. Some claim that OPT holders take a big advantage over US citizens. This relates to the guarantee of equal opportunity during the hiring process. The government strives to organize a nation renowned for its freedom and equality. The companies in US are bounded by law to ensure the hiring procedure declares clarity and equality. There should not be a bias towards international OPT holders, and if there is in individual case, it needs to be taken seriously through the legal system. However, such occasion does not relate to the issue of OPT extension.\n\n3. Some claim that international employees consume the resources of the nation that are provided by the citizens. This question is three-folded. First, rather than consuming the labor resources, international employees are actually a backup supplier to the huge labor need in US. This relates to the general acceptance criteria of H1B visas and should not be related to OPT which is just a practice program. Second, the international employees contribute a large amount of tax along with their income. Besides, some successful ones later on establish companies and provides many new jobs. They are providing back both labor resources and financial resources to the US government. Third, US universities strive to constitute diversity student body but I did not hear claims of international students consume too much of educational resources in US. The number of OPT holders is regulated by the admission of universities and permission of OPT, and is relatively a small amount compared to the body of US citizens. Just like they do not consume too much educational resources, they do not consume much labor resources.\n\n4. US is not going to train STEM researchers for other countries; she needs to keep them contributing to the nation without losing them. The reason why US stands in the frontier of science and technologies is because of its strong focus on STEM fields. The US government has invested huge amount of resources in training the world-class STEM researchers from different countries. However, even for the brightest people, innovation is hard and needs time. Many international STEM researchers have to return to their original countries before making any contributions to the US. This is a huge waste of resources and is against the effort towards sustainable growth.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Weijie Shen", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14662", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this extension.

Their conduct can be very important to the nation. Almost every country knows a basic fact, that is, you need more advanced people to help you do the \"awful\" work.\n\nTo be precise, I'd rather like to talk about a very specific phenomenon worldwide, it is the use of temporary workers. First of all, you don't have to pay them monthly salaries, only hourly, and second, you don't have to consider their family, their insurance, health, or even social status, as long as they are still capable of finishing the work. And, so it is actually the same in the so called STEM majors. I don't really know anything about the masters student, but at least in the Ph. D level, most of the students are dedicated to the long and tedious research work. I believe that the Shell company would like to \"hire\" a Ph.D to finish the analyses than a real analyst. And so are the same with many other companies. It is quite important to notice that research, indeed, is not like what your lawyers, your news comments, or the public think. It is not totally Einstein, it is actually very very basic, tiring, tedious, repetitious work, carried on day by day, and years by years. I believe that you know the sciences are more \"advanced\" than the retail seller's work, and it needs extra education. But the truth is, we, the very basic workers, are being paid no better than your citizens. We are not roaming around after school, we are always going directly to our apartment after lab time, we dedicated more than what we have received. We are not flooding into your country, we are just following the steps of pursuing a good science research.\n\nWhen it comes to the national level of economic interest, I think that United States, are probably the best in appreciating the need of excellent sciences. Nowadays, after the financial crises, most of your enterprises experienced a strong recover and reboot. However, my country, didn't. And they can hardly ever will. You know what I am talking about. Many developing countries lack the resources of individual technology, and they do not have enough scientists doing the work. But now you just have it, so you are probably not appreciating it. Your honor, DHS, the F-1 students are first of all not threatening the security, and second, they have dedicated to the growth and recover of US economy. I really want you to consider what we have done, and what we will do. It is all up to your benefit. During the OPT, we are not only earning working experience, but we are doing the very very basic technical works that most Americans don't like to do. You know that if we are not working here, the cost will eventually goes up, and it is definitely not a good news to thousands of enterprises, and so it is not a good news for Americans as well. Yes, they do need very professional specialists, but they also need someone like us to do the \"work\". What's more important is that, as you know, the new coming workers are always the most diligent, and after maybe five years, they know how the company runs, and they become \"not diligent\".

As an international student, being able to practice the knowledge that we have learnt into particular work after graduation through OPT is one of the most important reasons why I come to United States. That is the reason why most of my friends accept the offers from universities in United States, not from UK or other countries, because we all know how important it is for us, especially for STEM students. \n\n2. With the increasing of international students, the economic of surrounding area of campus has been improving fast. Local residents are making more money by running any kinds of supporting business, such as restaurants and properties. For local natives, more job opportunities are created by the expansion of these companies in order to reach the need. I can clearly observe the progress of becoming more economical prosperity around our campus.\n\n3. I have to say competition exists,but it is not a bad thing. Even if STEM students have OPT extension, there are too many disadvantages on international students compared to natives. To achieve the same career goal as native residents, international students need to pay more efforts and language will be the first barrier. Therefore, to those who claim \"Let's keep these jobs for hard working Americans, not foreigners!\", I just want to say you are not hard working enough.

Please don't suppose that every international student has a tendency to immigration.\n\nAnd as international students, our tuition is three times as much as local students. Universities take great financial benefit from us while many companies don't hire foreiners at the very begining. OPT policy is a strong reason that motivates us to study abroad. Cancelling OPT extension will surely lead to a decrease of financial bonus from internaional students.\n\nMost of the STEM students here are excellent in their original country. We have to be more qualified than local students to get a job while most of the local students have strong people network for job hunting and don't have to overcome the language problem.

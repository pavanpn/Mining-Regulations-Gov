Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for.

If we browse though the comments that disagree with the extension proposal, we can notice that the arguments are general like this:\n\nOPT is, based on plenty of study, a destructive program that (1) provides employers with cheap labor, (2)harm the citizens job opportunities, and (3) threat the national security. \n\nSo here is what I want to say. First of all, if any one of these arguments has solid supports and proof, to say that the most of the international graduates do create the negative impact to US, there wont be this discussion at all. If it is obviously so terrible, then what is the reason there is the proposal to extend it? \nSpecifically, for (1), it really lacks evidence support.  Even this were a situation happening right now, dont you think it is wiser to argue with the large companies to share their profit more with their employees than calling us the cheap labor? This kind of comments is really racist. We are not the reason of the so-called low income (let alone that whether the income is low is still not sure), the people who make the salary is. We should come together to fight against the employers if necessary. Expel people to make the society better is never the solution during the long way of human history.\n\n(2) Similar reason as for (1), there is one job there and all the people who are legit to work can apply for it. Being an international student doesnt give us any privilege in job hunting. When the human resources/professors see our resumes, they normally wont see the citizenship. They see what people have done, if they like the resume the company would like to talk to the people and decide whether he/she is qualified for the job. Doesnt this sound fair? If you dedicate to the job and show your determination, you can get what you want. And if you cherish the opportunity, you can do your job better and longer. If you ask me to point out one thing that is special about the international graduates who are under OPT, I think it is that we cherish more about the opportunity and time and eager to experience more about the US outside of the campus. Work hard and being diligent is also the foundation of US. The job opportunity is equal to everyone who deserves it. \n\n(3) is more ridiculous. If we think the security is not good enough, should we remove all the people that do not have completed information, or should we enhance the security system? The answer is obvious the latter. Besides, there is no enough evidence to prove that the international people are the threat to US.\nTo sum up, I support the extension of OPT. The opposite comments provide a lot of negative situation our society encounters right now and try to blame the OPT .  Removing OPT is not the CURE! Equality and freedom are what makes US the place people are looking forward. These merits should be what people cherish and work hard for. There is competition, there is conflict, but all these obstacles make us think and find out the true issue of our world. People is not the issue, the thought is. Start to change ourselves to make our own world better, rather than blame the others who are innocent. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xing Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13889", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Support this rule. \nFirst, international student benefit not only the company who are hiring them.

First, I think this will definitely attract more talented international students from all over the world. Personally, I was attracted by the 17 months STEM training opportunity policy in US, comparing to other countries like Canada, Australia and England. Since the opportunity of tanning is a big concern of most international students, this new rule will bring more talented people into US, meanwhile, it will also provide more diversity in the STEM area.\n\nMany people may concern that it will decrease the opportunity for domestic students, however, if you have been in any career fair, you will find there is only a few job opportunities for international students. And, if any international student finds an internship, it is obviously the best prove of his or her ability and knowledge. I think there is no reason to refuse talented people to make a contribution before they come back to their own counties. Moreover, the fact is that advanced technology companies need people from different countries. For instance, companies, like Uber and Tesla, they need people from different regions, like Asian, Europe and Australia, to customize their product so can achieve more successful sales. There are also many other examples that this rule will benefit both foreigner and domestic people. Foreigners will stimulate the US market in almost every area, like food, cars and electronics devices, besides, foreigners also bring a big benefits to the local real estate because many foreigners will pay a lot of rent to local people.\n\nAlthough, it may cause more competition to domestic people but competition is not always bad, on the contrary, it will bring more innovation. Such a diverse country like US, its tolerance and diversity make US lead the most advanced research and technology. And, more and more countries, like China, Canada and Australia, are going be more diverse and open, just like US, in order to attract more talented people.\n\nAnyway, it would be beneficial not only to foreigners but also US companies and domestic people.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Leilai Shao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12669", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a good proposal!

Your job is to represent Americans, not foreigners who are breaking our laws.  You were elected to represent only Americans, not foreigners, period.\n  \nEvery illegal alien should be removed from our country.  These people are openly hostile to Americans and they organize and say they are here to take \"their\" country back.  They have street events telling Americans to go back to England, or to the permafrost, or some such.  Why should we give these enemies of America anything but a one-way ticket out of our country?  This is not hate; this is love for our nation.  Who do you loveAmericans or hostile illegal aliens?\n  \nAnd even if some are not hostile to us, they should still be deported.  They are illegal.  They have a country of their own and they should stay there and deal with whatever problems they have, just as we should be dealing with our problems, one of which is illegal aliens.  Altruism will be the death knell of our country if people don't wise up quickly.\n  \nAnd then there are those who are not altruistic, but just want to destroy our nation by flooding the country with foreigners.  A multi-cultural country cannot survive for long because of the resulting conflict.  The \"melting pot\" isn't working, and as each of the newly admitted groups grow in number, the different groups become more polarized and hostile toward one another, and all of these new groups become more hostile toward Americans as each tries to turn the country into what they want.\n  \nYou, as an elected representative of American people, are in a position to help all Americans, including yourself and your posterity, by working to bring about the following:\n  \n1.  A moratorium on all immigration (legal and illegal) for perhaps five years\n2.  Absolutely prevent amnesty for any illegal aliens\n3.  Find and deport every illegal alien (no pathway to citizenship for the lawbreakers)\n4.  End the incentives that lure foreigners into our country\n5.  Change immigration law to admit only foreigners who have the desire and ability to assimilate into our traditional culture.  \n\nWhen working on this step#5, keep the following information in mind:\n\nYes, we are a nation of immigrants, but it was immigrants from Europe who were responsible for building this great nation.  They were willing and able to assimilate into the prevailing culture.  Immigration was from Europe, and there were laws to keep it that way--until the Immigration Act of 1965.  Now immigration is from everywhere BUT Europe. Most of these people have no intention of assimilating, and they are coming from cultures that are not compatible with ours.  \n\nWhen a country's people get replaced by a new and different people, that country's culture will change to reflect the culture of the new population.  This process has been referred to as the \"rise and fall\" of civilizations, where one culture gets replaced by another culture. Don't let altruism, apathy, tolerance, bribery, threats, or anything else convince you to allow a culture to be created that is not good for us.\n      \n...And here is another very important and related issue that you need to address:\n\nGiven that dual citizens are unlikely to give their full allegiance to America, don't you think it would be a good idea to ban dual citizens from participation in our government?  Can this be done?  Would you be willing to make it happen, by introducing and/or supporting legislation to bring this about?\n\n(Wikipedia:  In the United States, dual citizenship is common among politicians or government employees.)\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Raymond Davis", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10178", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Since the posting of this rule, there are much sentiment on social media and online policy discussion forums in favor of it. Occasionally, I see some worries regarding the impact of this rule to U.S. born STEM workers. \n\nIn my opinion, these worries are unfounded.\n\nI work for a public tech company. Our company promised the STEM graduates, mostly highly skilled Ph.D. degree holders, who are affect by the Aug WashTech ruling, to keep the same position and relocate to our Canada office. The reason is simple: the cost of replacing them is too high. \n\nI believe that similar arrangements will be made in other tech companies as well. In most STEM fields, the employees can work remotely. And most of STEM employers are international companies with oversea offices. The vacation of the OPT STEM extension will not necessarily mean that these jobs will go to U.S. born STEM workers, but rather rob this country of these young, high-earning, tax-paying,highly skilled workers (who will still hold these jobs) but live in a foreign country.\n\nThe argument that the companies hire international STEM majors because they are cheaper also doesn't have any supporting evidence. In fact, in most tech company's recruitment workflow, the party who makes the hiring decision (the tech lead or manager) and the party who negotiate salary (the HR) work separately. When the hiring decision is made, the salary negotiation hasn't started yet. It is impossible to discriminate against U.S. born STEM majors due to salary differences.\n\nIt will be beneficial, rather than harmful, to U.S. born STEM workers if we are able to attract highly skilled international STEM majors to stay in U.S. The main complaint against this rule is the U.S. born STEM workers' fear of competition. However, it is the rule of the market that improvements and innovation stem from competition. The competition in technology will not go away just because the U.S. workers are fearful. It will instead happen in other countries, and create even more incentives for U.S. tech companies to establish oversea centers and to outsource. The biggest beneficiaries of the Aug WashTech ruling would be China and India.\n\nIn addition, the Aug WashTech ruling is particularly unfair for the STEM major students graduated from 2013 to 2015. Upon graduation, they planned their living arrangements and career based on the STEM extension policy. The sudden change of the ruling invalidates their prior plannings, which can easily result in tens of thousands dollars of additional costs for them.\n\nPassing this new rule as is, will be a win-win for both the US and the US STEM workers. \n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2614", "postedDate": "2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a great rule!

We learn in USA, so our knowledge structure/system, our skills and techniques are most related and applicable to US society, which also best satisfy the demand of talents. I believe this program will accelerate the attraction of technical students, scholars and practitioners from all over the world. \n\nSecond, in the perspective of enterprises, the demand of technical workers are never decreasing. I have been to several career fairs at my university. I can say that the most demands always come from technical companies. Technology in the past century helped USA become the most powerful country in the world. There are numerous international tech firms based in USA. And technologies are continuing innovating. It is so important for them to remain talents.\n\nFinally, believe or not, there is an increasing number of talents loss in those technical fields, because many countries/governments have been trying to recall their talents.

The extension of OPT will be attractive to foreign student to come to study in America.Students of STEM program all over the world want to pursue a degree in America because the advanced technology as well as the opportunity to apply what they learned from school. However, if the OPT is not long enough, some of the student may reconsider where to get better education. What's more, even a few of the students think one year is enough to get some practice, company will hardly consider to take a employee who can work for only a year. If the possibility for a student to have a job or an internship opportunity after graduation is so small, there will be much less student come to study in America.\n\n2. Company will lose a lot of talent employee and the development of STEM technology will be postponed.If the OPT will not be extended,a lot of students who are working at a company but haven't get H1B or other type of vise have to go back to their country immediately.And those employee are thought can work longer than that.Company will have to make more effort to hire other people. However, since company hire these people mostly because they can't find an American who is suitable for this kind of job and international student won't get enough time to do this job, it will be harder for company to find a suitable candidacy. In the long run, since we get from point 1, there will be less international student who want to come to study in American, there will be even harder for company to find a right person. Thus, a lot of project will be forced to go a different way which will develop slower than the original plan with the right person.\n\n3. There will be a great economy lose. The international student not only contribute tuition but also other consumption like travel, rent, everyday supplies which not only boosted the GDP, but also created more job position for Americans. However, since there will be less international student, the opposite effect will take  place.\n\n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuqi Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14685", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support much of the new rule, but the rules regarding the proposed 'Training Plan' needs to be modified. This will create an unnecessary burden on both employers and the university officials charged with reviewing and approving the plans. \n\nAs for how this would impact universities, consider the following hypothetical: Student graduates from University A in a STEM field and then attends University B to get an MBA. After completing an initial period of OPT, the student must receive a recommendation from University B's designated school official (DSO) to work in a position related to the STEM degree received from University A. The DSO may have no familiarity with that student's degree or field of study. This added layer of bureaucracy is an unnecessary hardship.\n\nFor employers, this requirement seems excessive. Rather than some type of nebulous training plan, a better option would be a simple form to complete. The form should require various attestations (e.g., \"Employer has a system in place to evaluate the OPT worker's performance.\") \n\nIn any case, the ability to extend to 24 months is certainly an improvement.

History tells us that these talented international workforce bring talents, labors, ideas and capital to the market where it benefits the local people as well by creating more opportunities and new positions. Second, if the OPT extension fails, you will see a decreasing amount of enrollment in the US universities and colleges. Without enough students and enrollment rates, schools have to fire tutors/faculties or cut down the salaries/expenses. This will make more people lose their job. \n\nIn this way, you can see the benefits opposed to the harms. Let's get OPT extension Pass as it will bring more long-term benefits. We should be more fore-sightseeing.

It is the students' right to gain working experience after university's education. Internship and practical experience is a significant part of U.S higher education system. International students make huge commitment mentally and financially coming to U.S. to further their education. However, such important part of the education are deprived from students by putting a extremely short time frame on their internship. Take computer graphics industry as an example, the training for a mid-level engineer is normally three years, and training for a senior-level engineer is at least five years. With such a tight time frame for OPT, not only students don't have enough time to gain the experience that they need for their career, but also employers have to make huge commitment to hire and train OPT students which makes it extremely hard for F1 students to land a internship or job.\n\n2. U.S. was standing on the top of the world economy for the past 100 years. It is not achieved by shutting out the immigration with world's top skills and technology. On the contrary, it only reason why U.S was having such successful economy is achieve by embracing the competition and introducing the world's most talented scientists, engineers, businessmen, and artists into the States. In the phase of depression of economy, the only way the U.S can revive is to reopen the gate for inviting the tops geniuses who is leading the industry in the world. At the same time, not like most people believed, inviting industry tops will not affect the local business and labors since they are targeting to the different business fields. \n\n3. By extending STEM OPT period and relief Cap-Gap for H1-B visa, immigration can be more reliable and accessible for the people with skill and talent, the people who obey the laws and paying their taxes, the people who wants to contribute to the country and world. It is sad to see U.S is suffering from illegal immigrants, it is even sadder to see that illegal immigrants gained their visa and green card much faster by cutting short. By encourage the STEM OPT and Cap-Gap relief it is a big discouragement for illegal immigration, and there will be a huge boost for U.S economy and tax incomes, which otherwise would be lost in the gray areas. \n\nThere are many more reasons that I can cite to support this proposal.

In a short term, the international students consume products and spend money on local business. In a long term, they will contribute their knowledge to OUR society, this is the crux. The reason why they can come to US is they are smarter and work harder than their peers, if they can work for us and they can definitely bring true value to our society. People may say they will steal our jobs, but actually they don't. A lot of companies never hire international students because they don't want to pay for the lawyer fee and risk of losing them after 1 or 2 years when the visa is expired.

Im holding onto it and giving my support here.\n\nOPT Extension, is not the root cause for Americans losing jobs. To some people, please, stop blaming it thoughtlessly and actually to try to understand what it really is. OPT Extension has strict requirement on both employer and international student. Most important, any company wants to hire students on OPT Extension needs to be E-verified and goes through more complicated procedure, and of course, costs more. From my personal experience, the number of e-verified companies are very limited. It is already a negative situation that international students have to face while seeking jobs. A lot more companies will say explicitly they do not spouse visa, or will only hire Americans. And for students themselves, they have to be holding STEM degree to be eligible to extend OPT. Therere over 2000 majors in total according to CIP code but only about 400 of them are included in STEM. Its a small portion of all international students, and rest of them will only be able to do 1-year OPT. E-verify and STEM have already narrowed down the amount of students who can work for the extra time. It will not be a big impact on American peoples opportunity, but is essentially vital for each STEM student. People may still say it is unfair for Americans holding STEM degree. Yes, it is unfair, but not for Americans. International students are already on the weaker side. If people want a fair competition, just bring it on. Otherwise, before complaining about losing job opportunity, think twice about why you lose it, instead of trying to kill the competition itself. Ive seen talented and competitive American students in college, they never complain about losing opportunities to international students, and they all landed on decent jobs. Ive also seen a lot STEM international students trying so hard to find a job and get rejected soled because of their status. Receiving a job with lower pay is never the option, from people I know theyre all earning decent amount of salaries. Even if this happened in the past, the new rule has explicitly prohibited it.\n\nFor lots of international STEM students, OPT extension is a major consideration when they choose to come to United States. Without it, many will choose a different country, for those countries are providing better chances for students to practice their knowledge and therefore making contributions to the countries economy and technology. An accommodate and supportive environment is always the best way to attract potentially the worlds greatest talents, which is the reason U.S. became worlds greatest nation. I hope U.S. will not forget this spirit and become arrogant towards all foreigners. Drive out international students might create vacant in many companies and providing opportunity for locals, this is short-sighted and will definitely harm U.S. in the long run. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jihui Shentu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16318", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I will totally SUPPORT this proposal.\n\nI think it will give more opportunity to all america company and bring them more competitive power in the global market.

In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. [36] This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022. \n\n3. DHS also recognizes that it must quickly address the imminent vacatur of the 2008 IFR, and the significant uncertainty surrounding the status of thousands of students in the United States. As of September 16, 2015, over 34,000 students were in the United States on a STEM OPT extension. In addition, hundreds of thousands of international students, most of whom are in F-1 status, have already enrolled in U.S. educational institutions and are currently pursuing courses of study in fields that may provide eligibility for this program. Some of those students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. DHS must therefore act swiftly to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the 2008 IFR. Prompt action is particularly appropriate with respect to those students who have already committed to study in the United States, in part based on the possibility of furthering their education through an extended period of practical training in the world's leading STEM economy.\n\n4. A number of commenters, however, objected to the 17-month STEM OPT extension on the basis of potential negative impacts on U.S. workers in STEM fields. For instance, a commenter stated that demand for technical workers was very weak in engineering occupations and growing modestly in computing and mathematics occupations. The same commenter stated that, especially when combined with H-1B, L-1, and other skilled workers, the number of students taking advantage of the STEM OPT extension would distort the domestic labor market. Some commenters specifically stated that employers would prefer to hire F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions because these students would work for lower wages. Some commenters noted that some U.S. firms had previously advertised STEM positions as being available only to OPT students. Commenters requested that DHS consider written reports, testimony, and other sources describing the state of the U.S. STEM workforce. Commenters also questioned the veracity of studies and reports cited in the preamble to the 2008 IFR, and some questioned whether DHS had interpreted that information correctly in assessing the then-prevailing STEM labor market. Some commenters stated that the STEM OPT extension was contrary to the academic purpose of the F-1 statute. In general, commenters who made these and similar points requested that DHS eliminate the STEM OPT extension and the Cap Gap provision in their entirety. \n\nHowever, the fact is that most of companies intend to hire US citizens or green card holders instead of F-1 students. Since companies should take the risk for those who need to take the H1B lottery and they also need to spend a mount of money on F-1 employees for their salary to reach the minimum requirement, they always prefer to hire the US citizens and Green Card holders. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Junyue  Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11321", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a teacher, we are incorporating more STEM into our classrooms every day.

The STEM program is one of the most important factors that attract students from all-over the worlds to come to the US to study. As far as I'm concerned, Canada and Australia issue permanent residence to international students as long as they get a job after graduation. The STEM program that provides similar opportunities for international students to practice the knowledge and skills after graduation keeps the US universities competitive globally. For my case, the extension of the STEM means that I'm able to become more competitive in the job's market when I come back after working 3 years in the IT industry in America.\n\n2. Moreover, the STEM program helps the US keep a leading role in technology and economy. Many successful leaders, like Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Kai-Fu Lee, formal Google executive, started their career thanks to the STEM program. The STEM program has proven its value by encouraging talents from all-over the world to come to work and make the US companies successful. \n\n3. The extension of the STEM program doesn't hurt the interests of local Americans at all. Even with the extension of the STEM program, it is not easy for international students to find a job. With the disadvantages in language skills, international students need to work extra hard to get hired. As a personal matter, I spent all my time in studying and sharpening my programming skills, even at weekends.

Companies in STEM industries have already preferred US citizens over international candidates, if there are enough US citizen candidates who have the same skill set and capabilities with the International candidates. Why wouldn't they? Those tech companies are risking potential loss of those international employees who may have their legal working status expired.  So, why would they hire international employees if they have to face those potential troubles? The answer is a clear NO. So again, it's not because the OPT STEM extension rule that keeps US citizens away from their jobs. It's other reasons such as work outsourcing to other countries (like lots of 7/24 online services are now provided in Indian) and the lack of job qualifications of the citizen candidates themselves make them less competitive on the job market. \n\nThirdly, the statement that STEM OPT extension cuts the average salaries is also a FALSE statement. For my own cases and those other cases I know in my companies, international employees got the similar or even higher salaries as long as they are qualified for the positions. \n\nLastly, for long run, it will only do harm rather than benefit the US economics and technology development if the STEM OPT extension rule gets discontinued. International students are making huge contributions to the US country.

Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nTherefore, I think it is a wise decision to keep the STEM OPT Extension rule.

Since 1980, the inflation-adjusted growth of high-tech industries has averaged nearly 6 percent annually compared with a rate of 2.4 percent for other manufactured goods. (1, 2) In the United States, tech industry continues to make significant contributions to the US economy. It accounting for 7.1 percent of the overall US GDP with only 2% of the US population (6.5 million tech industry employees out of the 318.9 million US population in 2014). (3)\n\nHowever, Americas high-tech companies are starved for high-skilled workers. (4) Theres plenty of evidence of a shortage. A study by Virginia Polytechnic Institute estimates that more than 340,000 information technology jobs are currently unfilled. Wages in a number of high-skilled occupations such as systems analysts and software programmers have been rising at double-digit rates, a sure signal that demand is outstripping supply. The unemployment rate among electrical engineers nationwide today is 0.4 percent. The problem will only get worse. The U.S. Department of Labor predicts 130,000 new information technology jobs each year for the next decade. Yet American colleges are producing only 25,000 graduates in computer science a year, 40 percent fewer than in the 1980s, and only 20,000 electrical engineering graduates, one-third fewer than a decade ago. Although many high-tech jobs do not require such degrees, the decline in computer and engineering degrees can only aggravate whatever shortage exists. A lack of qualified workers is forcing U.S. companies to postpone new research projects. Two-thirds of information technology companies surveyed recently said the shortage of high-skilled workers is a barrier to their future growth. Cyprus Semiconductor of California counts 16 projects on hold because of a shortage of engineers. With product cycles of one year or less, every postponed project means lost sales, lost profits and fewer jobs created to support research and development.\n\nThe answer is simple: Lift the cap on high-skilled immigrants. Allow U.S. companies to hire the workers they need to get the job done, whatever the workers national origin. Immigrants already play a vital role in Americas high-technology economy. While immigrants are less than 10 percent of the U.S. population, they comprise 30 percent of research and development scientists and engineers with Ph.D.s. More than one-third of the engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign born. Andrew Grove, the founder and CEO of Intel, the worlds largest semiconductor maker, immigrated to the United States from Hungary. James Goslin, a Canadian national, developed for Sun Microsystems the Java programming language, which is now used by 400,000 programmers worldwide. (5) And in 2012, immigrant-founded engineering and technology companies in the US- heavily clustered in California-employed 560,000 workers and generated $63 billion in sales. (3). Why deprive ourselves of the present and future benefits of immigration when the past benefits are so obvious? \n\nHigh-skilled immigrants do not undercut the wages or job opportunities of native American workers. (6) Indeed, according to data from the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation, foreign-born engineers and scientists typically earn slightly more than their native-born counterparts with the same academic credentials and experience. Immigrants also bring specialized language skills to industries such as software, where a growing percentage of sales for U.S. companies are in non-English- speaking markets. By enhancing the innovation, growth and competitiveness of American high-tech companies, immigrants create job opportunities for nativesalong with better and more affordable products for consumers. \n\nSo why dont American companies train natives to fill the open positions? Americas high-tech industry already spends more than $200 billion a year on formal and informal job training. Companies that need workers today cant wait indefinitely for the public school monopoly to improving its teaching of math and science. Companies pay a $10,000 to $15,000 premium to cover the relocation and visa application costs of a skilled immigrant under the H-1B program, with no savings in labor costs. If U.S. companies could meet their personnel needs by hiring only natives, they probably would. But there are simply not enough qualified native workers to meet demand. In the end, the only proof of a worker shortage that matters is the fact that companies want to hire workers but are being prevented from doing so by a government restriction.\n\n(To be continued)\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xingyu Nie", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17455", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As one who aspires to start a tech business in US, the extension of OPT to 3 years will allows student like us to have enough time to develop the business and therefore contribute to local employment rate and US economy.

American industry and economy would not want to fall behind, and they MUST utilize tremendous resources from outside, and that is F1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees.\n\nSecond, if STEM extension no longer exist, American higher education as a study-abroad destination will lose its attraction: hundred thousand students will choose Canada, Europe, Japan, or Australia. Consider it, this means giving up enonous amount of international students' tuition revenue , and their consumptive power.\n\nIndividuals, do not be short-sighted and just consider your personal lost or gain. The STEM labor market is huge.

In recent years, international tech students contributed a lot in development of high-technology and American economy. Without the effort of these workers,  it is predictable that America will lose the leadership of the High-Tech market just because of the lack of these intelligent and hardworking engineers.\n\n2. The STEM extension doesn't mean the government treats better to foreigners. As we all know, employers always hire the employees who will bring them the maximum benefits. The foreigners don't have the advantages when competing with native citizens and they even need more arduous efforts than local people. This is because companies need more complicated process and even pay more money to hire a foreign employee. Therefore, the point that expanding the OPT will leads the native unsuccessfully finding a job is ridiculous since the condition of job market is finally the result of the health competition. The absence of foreign workers doesn't imply the native has more job opportunities if they are not qualified to get the position. On the contrary, the health competition from the foreign employees will motivate the native to be more strong and creative in pursuing their career goals.\n\n3. With the impact of globalization, most countries in the world tend to attract foreigners to their country because they realize the people coming from different places will bring various cultures and opportunities for them to expand their business in the rest of the world. The United States has one of the most democratic and pluralistic society in the world, and it is why this country attracted so many talents to come here to achieve their American dream. \"All men are created equal \" is the national ethos of the United States, so if the expansion of OPT is abolished, is it contradicted with the root of national spirit of the United States? \n\nAll in all, the OPT extension will bring huge benefits to both government and individuals, and it will also lead the United States continuously being the most powerful and competitive country in the world.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Junwei Ying", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16131", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This proposal is so great!\nUS needs a larger high-tech workforce to maximize economic growth.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fang Yao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17065", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I Support for 24 Months Stem Eextension.

A lot of people come to the US rather than go to other countries because of this benefit. If the extension was canceled, then it would be a threat to the US educational institutions financially. No one would ever want to bring cash to the country anymore in exchange of education. The extension, to some degree, is a basic sales strategy that has worked well. \n2. US higher education has been long short of enough students to do research. If the attractiveness of US education went down because of the cancellation of the extension, then the US research and high tech would be the first victim. US will lose its biggest advantage over other countries and will eventually lose its power. \n3. People cannot equate OPT with the general immigration problem. OPT is very restrictive - only granted to those who have studied in a US institution. It is not even immigration. It is funny that US allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come to this country for free but does not give qualified people who are anxious in creating value for the United States to stay. \n4 Some mentioned that US does not have a shortage of stem workers, which is so untrue. The companies not only need stem workers, but truly qualified skilled stem workers. A Master student who have been in the university for 6~7 years is not the same as someone who attend a training course for 3 months. The poor high school stem education prevents the universities to produce enough skilled workers in the first place. Until the high school stem education problem is fixed, there is likely to be such a shortage. \n5. If people do not have the right skill set but blame just those F1 students for taking their jobs, I do not see any hope in this country. Even the F1 students all left after graduation, the companies would just hire them from overseas instead of hiring locals who are not capable of doing the job. \n6. The rule is exactly there to solve the low wage problem. The wages for a lot of PhDs and Masters are the same or even higher than the US citizen. Only some other programs(ICC who abused the H1B program) may allow hiring unskilled workers from overseas. OPT is the wrong target if people really want to make sure that companies do not hire foreign nationals for lower cost. US citizens should be smart enough to have the right judgement for this issue, right? \n7. OPT, even not a direct immigration issue, can also be related to immigration. OPT is itself a filter and will filter out people who are not good enough, as a three year period of working in a company is the best exam a student can take to prove his/her abilities. Those who are not good enough will get fired and go home. But those who can stay will have the option to either stay or leave after the end of the OPT period. The US government then do not have to spend all the time and money and labor to come up with metrics to evaluate if an applicant is qualified for citizenship. Furthermore, a country needs immigrants, period. This is a fundamental economic rule that exists in nature. The two important driving force for economy are population and technology. Population-wise, companies needs demand to produce. Wont people eat and rent houses and buy stuff and spend money here and there after they start working under OPT? Why do people only see OPT worker taking jobs, but not see the other aspects? Remember the financial crisis in the 1930s? Nobody wanted to buy stuff, and companies had to stop producing, and so laying off workers. Technology-wise, I think enough has been mentioned about how immigrants contribute to research and product development.\n8. If students who are studying in the US all go back to their country after 1years of training, they will definitely not stay. Even worse, they will soon create value for their countries that will one day compete with the US companies. The US uses its own education to nurture its competitors? \n9. The fundamental reason for the extension to be 24 months is that a lot projects are 2~3 years long. It would be very much a trouble for companies to switch among different workers for the projects.\n\nIn summary, I think OPT extension is not a threat to the US and US citizens, but rather a benefit for exactly the US universities, companies, economy(and therefore for each individual.) Particularly, this very ruling is exactly out there to address people's concerns about abusing the OPT program and to make sure the OPT program will not become a drain for US jobs.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mengchen Tang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19651", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the proposed STEM extension for OPT students for the following reasons:\n\n1.

The graduates from STEM majors has been making vital contribution to the US economy. The IT industry has developed very fast in the recent years relying on many foreign students who graduated from different STEM majors, which also creates many positions for Americans. The development of economy helps building up more companies and hiring more American people. Also, they pay a significant part of tax which helps the federal and state governments better serve the people.\n\n2. The international students with STEM degree is an important part to keep the USA the most powerful country. We are facing a competition from China, Russia and India in technology and economy every day, and the majority of the foreign students in science and engineering are from these countries. The current immigration law makes it very hard for these students to work legally in the United States even if they are hired by the high-tech companies. If we force them to return to their home country, they will only support the tech companies in their country and our highest level education system is just teaching and training students who work for our competitors. By setting up this OPT-extension, these students will have a chance to work in the United States and contribute to the industry here for at least 3 years and possibly longer if they apply for other types of visa later.\n\n3. Please also be aware that for most Ph.D. students and some master students, the tuition fee and some of the living expenses are covered fully or partially by a fund from the university. This is eventually paid by all tax payers, that is, every American. If we force these students to return to their home country right after graduation, we are effectively using our tax-payers' money to educate future workers for our competitors. This will definitely hurt the USA in the very near future and we should figure out a way to fix it. OPT extension is a temporary way to deal with this.\n\n4. The international students in STEM fields will not have a bad impact for local workers. First, the STEM industry is in lack of human resource, so that a foreign student in those fields does not \"occupy\" a position for local workers. Second, the STEM field is highly paid and this is way beyond the minimum wage. For example, a fresh graduate software engineer who works in Google gets paid more than $50 per hour, which by no means keeps the minimum wage from growing.\n\nFor all the reasons above, I support the proposal by the DHS on OPT extension, and I also hope that the federal government and congress can figure out a long term solution to make it easier for highly educated talents to stay in the US -- this will help keep the USA the most powerful country in the future.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bin Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16425", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "24 month extension is very important for international students, please let it pass!!!!!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yueyi Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11515", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months instead of 17 months.

Therefore, the tuition that international students paid in most cases help to benefit the universities to develop advanced technologies and modern facilities for the educational system, which in turn help the local students who also learn at the same school.\nIn addition, extending the OPT Program will help to benefit the US employers because if the students who only works in a company for one year, it would be difficult for him or her to contribute what he or she has learnt to the company. We know that the business culture is different from schools, and it takes time for a student to get sufficient sources within one year to learn how to do business within his or her organization. However, if the OPT Program is extended to another 24 months, the new hire will know the business enough and then think deeper to provide more suggestions to his or her managers about the efficiency of the operation and provide some great ideas. This will be not only beneficial to one team, but probably will help other team to improve the business at the same time, which will be a very good thing to a local US company. And in the long run, if the company would like to do business with international countries, having someone who has worked in US for around 3 years would and send them back to their country will make the deal easier, which will again benefit the US company in the long term.\nIn addition, to local US people, extending the OPT Program for another 24 months means that thousands of hundreds of this group of people will need to rent an apartment in the states, which will help to support more families who have room in their family to earn the rent, which is a very nice thing.

They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for.

Not only because the whole US society needs high tech students but also it's a beneficial step for the whole US society in a long run.\n\nFirst of all, it's unfair to look international student as potential competitor. Actually, it's really self-minded and ignores the important economics effect of international students as positive impetus. They do not deprives job opportunities of US local citizens. Most international people receive their advanced degree and master specific expertise when they graduate. These people can actually contribute the US society immediately and have big positive impact on economics and sustainable development of company. Brain is the power,  US becomes the NO.1 strongest country and leads people a high quality life, not just because of the citizens but also the  thousands of international students year by year. They are hired in high tech companies and continuously contribute the company development and making more profit. High tech companies are thirsty for the intelligent people with good expertise. It's true that local people are far not enough from the company's demand. Nowadays, US economics is getting better since the 2008 economic crisis. It needs leaders and young engineers follow up to boom the economics up and keep it energetic. Now it's a good time to absorb more young students. The proposed rule helps it a lot and I really don't understand people's negative arguments. OPT allows international students stays longer in US. They've done pretty good job. But they usually receive higher salary and there's almost nothing to do with minimum wages. \n\nIn addition, OPT extension is a way of attraction for intelligent international students. Every years, they pay millions of dollars and increase the income of people in US. International students is an important constituent of most US colleges and research institutes. They are well trained and contributes lots of original research. If the proposed rule is denied, it will definitely largely affect the international students coming in future and the current international students might be forced o go back to their own country and make their own efforts or they will go to those countries welcome them. That's a big loss of US and I didn't feel any reason to be against the proposed rule. In the long run, job opportunities and equality is not obtained by excluding smart people and intelligent engineers. In contrast, an active economics and sustainable sources of qualified people for the potential jobs can really benefit it. I think OPT extension is a good effort in the right direction. \n\nOverall, I restate my strong support for the proposed rule.  \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xueyou  Duan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15793", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "America is a nation of immigration that it has a long history to embrace immigrants.

The same case is also true for many of my colleagues. \n\nI strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I recently graduated am working in Silicon Valley under OPT now.  I greatly appreciate this opportunity and it opens a new world for me.  It offers a totally different perspective into my area of study, which can no way be achieved through course work at school.  When I heard the news that the original STEM extension program would be cancelled, I was so disappointed and sad.  It basically deprived a precious study opportunity to hone our skills gained at school from all internal students like me.  Im particularly excited to see the a new STEM extension plan has been proposed and the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. \n\nAs I discussed, OPT and OPT extension provides an irreplaceable learning opportunity for students to hone their learned skills in real practice.  They are indispensible parts of university education, especially for engineering areas.  Universities in the US have a long tradition of upholding practical training.  The motto of MIT is mind and hand, which means that we need to learn from real life, from real practice, from introducing our ideas and knowledge into real applications.  What is more, the OPT and OPT extension is also very important and beneficial to the US society and US economy.  During the OPT and OPT extension, all international students are rewarding the US society with their knowledge and brilliant mind, which is one of the many reasons that keep US the leader of the world.  In my personal view, the OPT and OPT extension not only benefit the US through the actual talent input, but also by signaling that the US is a society that warmly embraces talents from all around the world, which is why US can attract best talents from all around the globe and in return, helps the US to stay as the leader of the world. \n\nMy current OPT will expire next May.  I greatly enjoyed my OPT so far and would definitely need more time to fully benefit from the program.  Without a STEM extension, I would have to go back to my home country and work from there.  I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule. \n\nFinally, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKai Wang\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kai Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8350", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The extension of OPT of 24 months is very necessary for the f-1 students.

Teitelbaum, a senior research associate at Harvard Law School. In his recently published book, Falling Behind: Boom, Bust & the Global Race for Scientific Talent, Teitelbaum says, This apparently broad consensus prevails notwithstanding almost universal inability by objective labor market analysis to find any convincing empirical evidence to confirm the existence of such generalized shortages.\"--\n\nAs this highly credible source indicates there is no shortage of STEM workers in the United States. It is nothing but a fabricated lie by business owners so that they can import foreign workers and drive wages down. As so many recent articles have stated STEM wages our basically stagnant. I am living proof of this. I started with a software company in February of 2010 and have not received a pay raise since that time. From what I can gather very few of my colleagues have either. When we recruit for interns there is no shortage of applicants and we basically get to hire whomever we want to. From this group of interns, full time job opportunities are extended upon graduation from college.\n\nAlso, if there was such a shortage of STEM workers then why aren't outrageous salaries being offered to STEM workers with huge signing bonuses.

I am current under OPT and will need extension Feb 2016. I will be directly impacted by the regulation. In my opinion, the regulation of \"expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with stem degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students\" not only benefit the F-1 stem student, but also make positive effect on companies and schools in United States. The reasons I think the regulation is absolutely necessary are as follows:\n\n1. It fulfills the companies needs. \n\nHigh tech companies like Google, Facebook, Qualcomm hire thousands of international student with OPT every year. From the company aspect, it usually costs more to hire an international student. H1-B sponsorship and green card application is extra cost compare to hiring US citizen. The reason for high tech companies to keep hiring international students is that they have to do it: they need the work force to push the company moving forward. And apparently, hiring US only citizen and green card holder is far from enough. If all international students under F-1 visa have only 12 months OPT, many will decided to go home. Most of them are highly educated in US and qualified employee. It would be a huge lost for the companies that need them.\n\nI notices that people try to blame the international student for their unemployment. International students get hired not because of their immigration status, it is simply because they are better match for the positions. Even without competition of international student, those who did not get the job will remain the same. Because international student is a work force that compliment employee structure of US. There are positions that most of the qualified candidates are international students. Deporting them will not give more chance to US citizen and green card holder, but only to lower the company standard and sacrifice the functionality of the team.\n\n2. The schools need the regulation.\n\nUniversity is the place needs the diversity the most. People from different culture and environment often bring great deal of positive effects to the school. And that becomes more significant regarding the faculties. However, Ph.D. graduates usually spend couple of years doing post-doc before joining university as faculty. The period of post-doc is very critical to the student and they usually rely on OPT for the legal immigration status. This regulation provide extra time for the international student and at the same time provide more qualified faculty candidates.\n\nTo conclude, this regulation is very necessary and important not only to international students but also to the US companies and universities.\n\nWen", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wen Howe", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18723", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons.\n\n1.

Numerous great engineers, scientists, professors who made and are now making great and continuous contribution to the USA used to studied at American Universities.

Competition makes a society healthy and keep a country in power. The F-1 students with STEM degrees do not steal job opportunities from the US citizens. It is because for those job positions which require higher education in STEM fields, there are not enough number of US citizens. Those US citizens who are unemployed do not fulfill the requirement of such job opportunities and there are plenty of jobs for them in other fields. Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students can enhance the Competitiveness of the USA and guarantee the US citizens a better life. \n\n4.Once the USA is stay in power with great competitiveness, the ordinary US citizens can continuously benefit from it.

I work in the research and development department of a large pharmaceutical company. Due to the nature of our products, our company hires a large number of people with STEM degrees. Most of the project work here involving STEM does not only require technical knowledge in STEM, but also familiarity with applications in the related medical fields, as well as familiarity with the internal/external standards, especially the ones defined by the regulatory agencies. Our experience is that it usually takes 3-6 months before a student who just graduates from school gets on full speed with the project work. If there was only 12 months of the OPT status, most of the foreign students hired by the company would be forced to resign after a year , due to the low chance in the H1B lottery (http://www.immi-usa.com/h1b-lottery-2016-results-chances-process/). Without proper extensions, many foreign students would return to their own countries after graduation due to future job insecurity. Thus the first benefit from the extension is that more highly skilled and highly qualified foreign students will be available to the US employers. Our industry is full of innovation and highly qualified, creative employees can really facilitate the drug development. \nThe second benefit is obvious: the foreign students would be able to work for the employer for a healthy amount of time thus the 3-6 months of training would be more cost efficient. In the long run, hiring highly qualified employees (US or non-US) increases the chance of establishing a healthy business and thus could generate more job opportunities, STEM or non STEM. For example, a successful pharmaceutical product launched in market usually triggers a number of sales job openings, which are mostly non-STEM opportunities. Meanwhile, it also generates revenues for future development, which opens up the STEM job opportunities. Hiring highly-qualified and innovative employees will definitely help the companies onto a more sustainable path.\n\nOn the other hand, people might be concerned that the extension proposal may jeopardize the employment chance for the US STEM workers. In principle, this is a demand and supply question. My impression is that my US friends in STEM fields can usually land a job fairly quickly as long as they are qualified on paper (this is very small sample so it is probably not accurate). I read different numbers from various sources but it seems that the consensus is that US workforce lacks enough STEM workers due to various reasons (2.4 million unfilled STEM positions by 2018, http://www.adeccousa.com/employers/resources/Pages/infographic-stem-skills-are-driving-innovation.aspx). An interesting analysis on the online job postings reveals some other important facts about the STEM shortage (http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/job-vacancies-and-stem-skills#/M10420). This research analyzes job postings advertised on company websites for companies located in metropolitan areas (in total 4.7 million job postings in part of 2013). The principle finding of the study is that there is a relative shortage of U.S. workers with STEM skills. More interestingly, the higher required education degree is, the harder it is to fill the STEM position. Thus the OPT extension proposal in fact would address the potential job vacancies that require higher educational background, which are also the positions most difficult to fill. Without such OPT extensions, there would be an even more difficult time for the employers to identify the right candidate employees.  \n\nIt is understandable that there could be cases where individual US STEM workers are affected by the OPT extension proposal however every policy has its pros and cons. Such policies should always be evaluated on a large scale from a general perspective and see if it benefits the US employers and employees in general. With such a large discrepancy in demand and supply, the STEM opt extension will grant more qualified STEM workers to meet the increased demand. \n\nIn the end, a healthy corporation needs highly qualified employees. The STEM opt extension will help the US corporations attract and keep the top international STEM students, similarly to what is being accomplished in the US academic infrastructure (US academic systems attract the top-notch researchers in the world continuously due to good facilities and benefits, including immigration benefits). In return, the international students contribute with their technical expertise and innovation, which is exactly what is needed in the long run as a competitive corporation.

First, in this trend of industry comeback, more job opportunities open up for the high-tech talents. We don't see evidence for the lack of STEM related jobs. Second, most students in STEM are not US citizens. In fact, it's not the foreigners rob the opportunities from citizens, but you, citizens, abandon your rights in competing with foreign students in these area, as they are not easy and money-making subjects.\n\nThe other consideration is on immigration. Opponents conjecture the students tend to stay longer to make time for immigration. Though whether the conjecture is sound is arguable as the ratio between the number of foreign students to the available work visa status (H1B for example) has been increasing tremendously in recent year, let's assume they are right - the students in STEM extension have stronger immigrant intent. US is a nation founding on immigrants. It always needs to balance the benefits from immigrants ant original citizens instead of simply shutting down the doors for immigrants. Almost every country wants to introduce high quality immigrants with wealth, technology, or knowledge. STEM students are of these high quality immigrants. They are selected as the most talented people in their motherland. Moreover, much more new immigrants to US are not from colleges like them but through the board. \n\nIndeed, the explosive number of foreign students do make impact on the interests of citizens. Instead of refusing them staying longer, I would suggest to keep many of them from getting accepted by universities in the first place. Many universities set a lot of new programs for foreign students for just profits. For example, I have heard about a program is full of Chinese. But remember, the money they invest here are the debts you paid from purchasing the cheap low-qualified daily products, while what they get back is the essence of the human culture knowledge and technology if you refuse to take them. So, if you cannot select out the elites who you want to keep from this huge number of students, do not expand admission and let only the best in.\n\nIn all, I advocate to approve the STEM extension, which would also be useful to me, as a postdoc, people doing the most creative works but with miserable payment.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Le Yan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17225", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the rule to extend the STEM OPT period by 24 months.

US citizens have taken over all the advantages, and extension time is the only help for international students. As for international students, there has been many disadvantages for them when study in America. They lack the language ability as native speakers, they lack the understanding of living, working and social culture of the country, they have no relationship to rely on when seeking for a job,and there is almost no internships for international students either.  If the government agree with some remarks here that OPT Extension treats foreigners better than the US citizens, then they must ask themselves: isn't it silly and selfish to take over all advantages and say an extension will ruin their lives? It is a basic fact that, even if there is OPT extension for STEM students, it is still very hard for these students to find even a very common job, usually below average.\n\n2.OPT Extension gives international students as well as the US a bright future. Not only international students can find a job and make a life in the America, but also america's economy and innovation is strongly relied on the foreign blood. It is a fact that US has used its excellent salary and working conditions to attract talent people from all over the world to make contributions to the country, and the STEM students is the most significant one. If the country don't give an opportunities for them, not only the students will have no American Dreams anymore, but also the whole country lost the new blood from the whole world. All these talented people need better education and work. If the US doesn't provide them what they want, they will also find another place to realize their dreams, like Europe and the other rising superpower, China.  I believe it is not a pleasing result that the US would like to see.\n\n3.The international students never take the best jobs in america, but do what you don't want to do, to fill the hole in the society. For the Chinese Petroleum Engineering students from the USC, there is usually 20 to 30 people each year, but only 1 or 2 people can find a job every year, not so related and lucrative as we suppose. The only senior student of 2013 Fall who find a job is to be a geologist that his working condition is bad and salary is not so high as petroleum engineer. The fact is that foreign students do what america students don't want to do, and make less money than them.

This OPT proposal, like its predecessors, is a too-clever attempt by Big Academia and Big Tech to subvert the H-1B caps which American technology workers strongly support.\n\nAs Ron Hira et al have shown, there is no need for degreed graduates of US STEM academic programs to be treated as interns in need of 3 years of further training. This OPT provision merely seeks to provide Big Tech's bosses with more cheap, indentured labor, circumventing the H-1B cap. As Daniel Costa notes, this proposal allows bosses to decide whatever wage is appropriate for the OPT foreign worker, and this proposal's worker protections \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.\" This proposal will only serve to further depress already-stagnant STEM compensation and working conditions, and to force more US citizens to seek alternate career paths.\n\nAs John Miano indicates, this OPT proposal requires US corporations and universities to provide mentoring programs for OPT-eligible *foreign* students, but not for citizen students. This OPT plan, like (but even worse than) its predecessors, will only increase the US STEM brain drain by driving talented citizen students out of STEM, and to replace them with foreign students who are (as Norman Matloff has demonstrated) no more talented (on a variety of measures), but who are much more profitable for US corporations and universities.

I'm a Chinese student who is majoring in Mechanical engineering and just graduated from college with a bachelor degree. I was shocked and terrified when I heard that there is a possibility of cancelling the OPT extension for students with STEM degrees because I may have to rethink of my career and prepare a new study plan. \nAfter I graduated, I accepted an job offer. My employer does not make an guarantee on sponsoring me H1B visa and I know I need it in order to obtain a longer authorized working period in US. However my employer still made me the offer because I have a total 29 months of OPT that I can use to go through job training and understand the business. And also my employer thinks it is going to take them to much time and effort to find another candidate like me, who has the unique and strong engineering background and can help their business reach the next level. The HR manger once clearly told me that 1 year work experience at any business may not help one at all since they did not have a solid understanding of the business during this relatively short period of time. I was glad at that time that I can have up to two and a half year to work in US. Currently I work in Quality field, where professionals will need to go through series of training and certification programs like six sigma green belt, black belt and lean manufacturing... etc.For example, in order to get certified as a black belt, the employee either has to go through company sponsored training program and university certification program. The courses may take 1-2 months to finish,however in order to get to certified as black belt one has to complete a project which has specific cost savings target. This target usually between 0.5 - 1 million dollars. The saving is significant and the company will take it seriously. Without this extended OPT period, even though I complete my training the company may not have the chance to see me make impact and finish big cost savings projects based on what I learned... My employer may have to face the reality and spend all these time and effort to find candidates and pay money on their training again simply because of my short OPT period. \nTherefore, the new proposed opt extension rules provide great benefits either for me or for my employer. 36 months period is a sufficient amount of time for me to go through a complete job training and practice what I learned in the business. It can help me build up confidence and prepare me better in my future career.

I can only imagine how much positive influence this policy will bring to all international students.The policy will definitely motivate STEM F-1 students to create more value for U.S companies while gaining precious over-broad experience of their own.And I am sure those STEM students will continue creating value for the U.S society. \n\nSecondly, I really don't think it is necessary for some anti-non-immigrant Americans to feel scared and intimidated by us, F-1 Students, probably taking over their jobs (or for whatever other reasons) and to act so against international students. Most of us are just young adults, in our early twenties, who are about to graduate with a degree and are curious and nervous to step into the society for the very first time in their life. If they can think about themselves for a minute and if they were in our shoes, wouldn't it be nice to be offered a 24-month practical training period to prove themselves how much value they can create with their bear hands and to see how far they can go on this path in this wonderful diversified land? The future is always in young generations' hand. I believe if young generations are treated positively, they will create more good vibes for this world.\n\nLast but not the least, every F-1 Students has different plans for their life after the OPT period, some decide to leave the States or some decide to stay, and etc. With our experience and diversified views, a lot of opportunities are coming to our ways. And I believe as non-immigrant students we will make the best choice for our current situations. All we need is more opportunities to explore ourselves. There is really no big harm.

The government should let the student who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the country and let them make contributions to the US. The knowledge they learned is best applicable in the US, and US is the best place to practice the knowledge they learned because this is the place the international students have gone to school.\n2. A big reason that International students paid out of state tuition and chose to come all the way to US over UK and other countries is that US has OPT and gives them time to work for a couple of years before they go back to their home country. These international students have taken into consideration of the fact that US will give them several years to practice their knowledge in the industry when they made the choice to spend this much money on their education, and also a big contribution to US economy. Majority of these students are STEM majors. If OPT extension gets canceled, US government will possibly be viewed as NOT trustworthy and credible. It will be bad for US economy and reputation. \n3. Sillicon Valley and the fast growing tech industry need millions of brilliant people to help develop. This is not a competition between American students and international students, and international students are not taking the job spots of domestic students. As we all know, it is still easier for domestic students to get the same job compared to international students, as companies have to pay more legal fees and procedures in order to hire international students. A lot of start-ups hire mostly domestic students. OPT extension will unlikely to change this dynamic of the job market. US citizens have nothing to worry about. On the contrary, big tech companies who need a lot of brilliant minds will hire both domestic students and international students. International STEM majors have made great contribution to the development of tech industry so far. Without these students, Google Facebook will develop slower and silicon valley will be unlikely to afford its current exploding speed. STEM majored international students are actually on the same side with domestic students--they are not rivalries.\n4. At last, 12 month regular and 24 month extension is a perfect length for STEM majors. Most big software development projects need at least two years to finish. One year is too short for these STEM majored engineers to practice what they have learned in school. It will also be way easier for these engineers to find jobs in their home countries once they complete a three-year industry training as opposed to one year.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Scarlett Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21176", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "International students spend billions of dollars in tuition fee every fee and at the same time are contributing to the economy of united states by paying rent and other expenses.

No doubt about this, if this proposal finally passed smoothly \nthen both STEM students and US will be really benefited from this OPT rules.\nDHS have done really good work within this short period of time.\n\nBut I want to highlight few points about this proposal where DHS should \nrethink to change little bit of proposal rules in few areas before prepare \na final rule to give a real sense of F1 OPT extension rules both for \nSTEM/NON-STEM catagory students to overcome the current H1B quota limitation \nproblem.\n\n1. I think that as per current OPT extension proposal, DHS intension is to \n   keep details track record about employees, employers and US university's, \n   so DHS can able to monitor every process in right track or not. But it \n   may be created a complexity to maintain the document from vice-versa. \n   So I am requesting to DHS, please try to find out easy documentation methods \n   which can be reduced the documentation over burden process for related \n   concerned sectors.\n\n\n2. Secondly my view is that current DHS OPT extension proposal have one\n   sided means they have extend 24 months OPT period only for STEM category.\n   It is no doubt that US need STEM people due to shortage of STEM manpower.\n   But non immigrant NON-STEM master degree holder like MBA want to contribute\n   their experience with vast experience after MBA to improve US economy\n   and revenue and also start their business in USA. But  they only get 12 months \n  OPT period after MBA  which is really very shortage time  to get H1B visa due to \n  unexpected smaller number of H1B quota as per current\n   manpower demand due to improvement of US economy. I know one person after\n   completed MBA from US university, now he have started business in Canada,\n   because he was unfortunate guy not able to pick up H1B visa due to lottery\n   system method.\n\n   Although current non-stem degree holder like MBA can enjoy 24 months OPT\n   extension as per current OPT proposal rules provided if he/she have done \n   STEM degree from US university before MBA and also OPT extension must \n   previous stem degree related. In reality, most of the MBA students will \n   like to work in Management segment to work with their analytic mind and\n   complex business solution problem. On the other side, very few international\n   students have done BS/MS in stem from US university before MBA. If we see the \n   statistics about international MBA profile in USA, then we will see most of \n   the international students have done their stem degree from their home country \n   and after 4-5 years practical experience in various industry, they take an \n   admission in MBA in US university to contribute expertise of their experience in \n   business management area as well as to get global business exposure or analytic \n   in management or start their business in USA and ultimately US economy will get\n   benefit.\n\n   So my request to DHS if they allow at least to non-us stem degree holder to get an\n   opportunity for 12 months OPT extension if 24 months is not possible then they \n   can contribute their experience what they have learned from us business \n   school to US companies for 1 year more and increase their chance to get H1B visa \n   for second time.\n\n   At last we want to say that please consider my above points and draw a final proposal\n   so nobody will be deprived from this OPT extension opportunity and it will be real\n   sense of immigration change to some extent until & unless H1B quota is to be increased.\n   and also must monitor no american employees will be effected from any types abuse \n   from this proposal. \n  \n   With Thanks & Regards\n\n  Swapan Mukherjee\n\n\n   \n   \t  ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Swapan Mukherjee", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1281", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this act to be reinforced.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by David Guo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18074", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Date 11/8/15\n\nMs. Katherine Westerlund\nPolicy Chief (Acting)\nStudent and Exchange Visitor Program\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n500 12th Street SW\nWashington, DC 20536\n\nRe: Comments on Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students\n\n80 Fed. Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated in 2015 May with a master of science degree in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should Be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nWith the extension of the training, I can obtain skill that needed in the world class industry environment, especially in my case, the headquarter of Microsoft, the company started the new age of software. The hand on experience I learned, the knowledge that is passed by generations of engineers worked in the company is hardly find in other place around the world. \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should Be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will help STEM Employers to have more diversity perspective. The training of academia give STEM graduates a different view and skill to the industry. OPT STEM can give increase the total number of graduate students with high education to the industry, together with the diversity of their variety of background.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning. In general, in my working group, new hire need more than 1 year to gain experience to actually give value to the company. At the same time, more time is needed to gain the understanding of the industry and start to build networking.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. \n\nSincerely,\nWu Li\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wu Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15830", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this proposal.\n\nAs a beneficiary of OPT STEM expansion program I am currently working on a cloud computing company which has more than 1 million active users, with Master degree in Computer Science.

I strongly support the opt extension program.\nMy support is not based on my personal benefit, but on the job opportunities that foreign students may actually produce for US during their OPT period.\n\nOpt is one of the most important and convenient period for entrepreneurship and forming start-ups.\nH1B visa requires that the foreign student work in the position that is directly related with their major. Therefore, an engineering student, for example, cannot form a start up as a CEO using H1B (CEO is not a position that is related with an Engineering degree). However, students holding OPT F1 visa do has the freedom to do so. \n\nMany foreign Creative STEM students are willing to push their creations into business and to create new job opportunities in US. Longer OPT extension period definitely increases the willingness for foreign students to form start-ups. In addition, longer OPT extension allows the start-ups to grow before the original 1-year OPT ends.\n\nIn this way, I believe the OPT extension program is very beneficial not only to foreign students but also to US in the following aspects:\n\n   1: more foreign  \"CEO\"s stimulate local economy by their daily living life. Such as purchasing local food, buying real estate and etc.\n   2: Stimulates cultural mixing.\n   3: For international student, longer OPT period provides start-ups enough time to grow.\n   4: For US start-ups, longer OPT period provides lower cost labor.\n   5: the real talented foreign student may have a higher chance to stay in US if their start-up is a success in US, and they will bring and grow their social networking in US.\n\n I read several comments on the OPT extension act, and I hope we, both foreign and US natives, could think not only for each individual, but also consider the nation as a whole. Holding talented people and creating more job opportunities are very beneficial the US nationa, and gives the foreign students higher freedom.\n\nI love all the people around me, my friends come from all over the world. I love both US and my mother nation. \nFinally, I apologize for any typo in the above comments.

From my opinion, I think this rule would tremendously advance the US economy in the long run by increasing the amount of skilled labors and advancing technology. According to theories from international trade, it is always good for countries to be abundant in skilled labor.\n\tFirst, the OPT Extension rule will support the development of local small engineering, and IT firms by encouraging them to hire more talented people. Therefore, it not only solves the shortage of skilled labor for firms, but also encourages these firms to make more progress. \n\tSecond, this program will largely help the technological advancement of this country as well as students home countries. After the Extension period, students will go back to their countries and keep working in the same area. Namely, this is a win-win situation.\n\tThird, this new program would attract more students from worldwide to the US, which could significantly raise the reputation for American Schools. Also, the tuition paid by international students has significantly contributed to the construction of local schools, economy, and even the national GDP. At the same time, more scholars will be attracted to the American universities; these people will publish more scientific papers as well as doing more experiments, which, in return, benefits the US.\n     \nI will also make it clear that this new program is NEVER an immigration program.  \n\tThe OPT Extension is a limited time working period aiming at gaining more experience in the related field. There are numerous firms, and these firms have vacancies ALL TEH TIME. People will still get jobs as long as these individuals are qualified. Everyone has to be qualified for the position he/she wants. Not being qualified does NOT mean other people steal your jobs. That individual is simply NOT QUALIFIED, and will not get hired anyway.\n\tSome people argue that OPT is an exchange of cheap labor. This is absolutely WRONG. DHS has a series of strict process including legal paperwork and proof to monitor and supervise the equal rights of the employment. I understand this program is not perfect but DHS is making it better by having a more detailed and transparent process for firms and foreign skilled labors to follow.\n\nI hope that people could be open-minded and stop hating others just for the reason that they are different. The United Sates is known as the land of equal rights, and everyone deserves to be treated unbiased. All talented people deserve more chances to practice their skills no matter where they come from because whoever works here is contributing to this country and making the lives of people who live in the country better.  \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wan Jiang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20912", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The proposed 'training opportunity' is taking away jobs from the American People.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\t\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\tthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\t\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ronald Stahl", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4285", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "USA is the most powerful and innovative country because it has always been open to ambitious and smart people.

The reasons are as follows.\n\nFirstly, according to NAFSA, for the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs. (http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy/) It's a great contribution to the economy regarding the education, travel, technology and other different aspects. This rule would be a good appeal to potential students while no STEM would definitely affect potential candidates' choice. More students would bring more revenue and more job opportunities in various areas.\n\nSecondly, it is the trend that the whole world going international. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). This rule will provide people in United States an opportunity to work together to make progress.\n\nLastly, most people used STEM to cover the time to wait for the work visa. The revoking of STEM really hits us all of a sudden as the end time February 16, 2016 is just in the middle of an embarrassing moment. The working visa would not start until April. It's really a big problem for us now working.\nThank you so much for your time and really hope this rule would be supported.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Linda Jian", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16321", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The proposed rule does not take into account that people on this visa are not required to pay social security taxes and medicare taxes and neither are their employers required to pay.

Complexity of the STEM jobs is getting more and more complex everyday. Due to this, just a single year of OPT is not beneficial for employer as well as student. It takes time for a newly hired person to understand the whole complexity. With STEM extension, employer would have a guarantee that the OPT worker will still be there in the firm after the initial expensive training.\n\n4. This rule is essential for holding on to the young and fresh graduates who might have a great business idea, a great concept which is not implemented because of the Visa issues. \n\n5. Highly skilled professional have created numerous jobs and billion dollar businesses in the United States of America. Today, all the students who wish to invent something look forward to the USA for better opportunities. If this rule doesn't go through, this might change forever. Students will avoid coming to US as rules won't be favorable as they are now. \n\n6. Generally when a student graduates and lands a job, he/she would spend a good amount knowing  there will be a substantial continuous income thereafter. If OPT extension is revoked, students won't spend much during their OPT year, since they might end up losing job a year later. This kind of slows the currency flow in the country. \n\n   For keeping everything smooth and not disturbing what is great for both OPT students and US as country, I strongly recommend this rule. \n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Amit Patil", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2057", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country.

As the international student advisor and PDSO at Trinity College in Hartford, CT, I appreciate the quick response to this issue in such a tight time frame. This shows a great care for the F-1 students who are currently in the US on STEM extensions of OPT and for those who wish to use this to gain important practical experience in their fields. I strongly agree with the proposed rule's increase in the length of the STEM extension as well as the addition of unemployment time after receiving the STEM extension. I also applaud the rule's proposal that students would be able to use a STEM extension for a subsequent STEM related degree. \n\nAfter reviewing the proposed rule, I have one comment on an aspect of the rule that may be problematic: I'm particularly concerned about the proposed Form 910 STEM Mentoring & Training Plan (Part V, D of the Proposed Rule). While I appreciate the thought behind this form in terms of providing more oversight into the actual practical training aspect of the STEM extension, I do worry that this requirement could create a barrier to the hiring of international students as it presents extra paperwork/work that an employer would not have to complete when hiring an employee who is a US citizen. As an advisor, I already see many students who are passed over for practical training opportunities because of a perceived notion that hiring a student on OPT would result in extra work that would be too intense for the employer to contemplate. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a definition as to who would sign off on the Mentoring Plan (i.e. who will serve as the Official with Signatory Authority). The confusion that this might generate as to who might be responsible for the signing of the form could be problematic. Additionally, it is unclear as to whether or not SEVP will require this form as part of the STEM Extension application in the future.\n\nAgain, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and for the work on behalf of the international students currently studying in the United States.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Katharine Clair", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5102", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a terrible idea.

If students who learned from U.S. university have to go back to their country because their OPT are too short and do not have enough time to explore their career in the U.S., it is a pity for our society. They should be allowed to stay and continue to contribute to the U.S.. After all, one of U.S. advantages is that U.S. utilizes international intellectual resources so it can keep leading in various industries for almost 50 years. \n\n2. This 24-month extension OPT is a great chance to let students to decide whether they will develop their career in U.S. or not. Studying life is totally different from working life. Although international students have spent years studying in the U.S., working in this country is new to them. The extension OPT will give them a great opportunity to let them decide where to stay by U.S. job market. It is a shame that those graduates, who may be talented in certain fields, have to go back to their country because of their OPT expiration. \n\n3. International students who has higher education degree can improve U.S. job market. Competition does exist and will exist if U.S. society want to select better people for a position. Some americans may argue that international students have already taken or will take over their jobs. But from what I can see, \"take over\" may not be the appropriate phrase. \"Excel\" may be a better. Employers always look for people who performs better regardless their races, religion, etc. . So job market will grow better, sending the right people to the right place. Those who lose the battle can reinvest themselves by further education, self-improving and come back to market fighting again. The U.S. job market will be better eventually regardless of international students.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.

The additional clauses to provide protection to US workers against displacement, ensuring adequate compensation for those on OPT and limiting the program to accredited schools also serve to preserve the intent of the OPT extension program.\nThe only debatable clause in the proposed rule is the 'Training and Mentoring Plan'. While it does not ensure that it will restrict OPT program abuse, it will definitely make genuine employers think twice before hiring students on OPT. The proposed rule requires the employer to prepare a 'training plan' when the student is about to potentially begin his 2nd year of employment. Most training usually occurs in the first year on the job and the 2nd/3rd years are usually spent on 'learning by doing'. Advanced degree/Doctorate degree holders are usually the most qualified personnel in a company and those on F-1 visas use the OPT program to obtain 'practical experience' by applying their skills and knowledge in the 'real world'. They may also have junior employees reporting to them. To expect both the employers and employees to be held against a 'training plan' for 3 years of employment for highly skilled personnel does not make business sense for either party. Business plans are confidential in nature and employers may not be comfortable in releasing detailed information to external sources and the training plan documents will end up being generic documents limited to high level job descriptions. University DSOs may not also be familiar with technical job activity descriptions and may not be in a position to review and approve these documents.\n\nThe STEM OPT program was conceived to allow students multiple attempts at the H1-B visa while gaining experience. Students who apply for the STEM extn are mostly those who were petitioned for by an employer but not selected in the H1-B lottery. If the employer has already considered them for an H1-B, it means that they have been considered suitable for regular employment. To put such employees back on 'training' mode does not make sense for the employer. \n\nWhat can be done in lieu of the 'Training/Mentoring plan' is to provide USCIS with a job profile document detailing employee roles and responsibilities and an organization structure chart. The job profile provided during recruiting or advertising for the job can also be included. If there are any significant changes in job profile or positions during the course of OPT, the same can be intimated to the DSO.

They are doing the work which has very high barrier for others to be involved in. \n\nThirdly, the 24 months extension will be a highly appealing selling-point for people who want to study abroad. Knowing that US may provide them with a chance to work for 3 years after graduation, they will pick USA as their first option for pursuing their PhD. This will bring more intelligent and smart people to USA, and also booster up the economy.\n\nOverall, I would be very happy to see 24 months STEM OPT extension get approval.

I have been in another developed country, Singapore, for four years. Its system is designed to categorize people by salary. High paid foreigners hold Employment pass and get large chances to become Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR). However, their criteria for approving SPR is not transparent. So they block foreigners to stay there by approving SPR or not and it's relatively easy to get employment pass for high paid job or work permit for low paid workers. In US, OPT plays the buffering role as Singapore's employment pass does. Once people get H1B sponsorship from the company, they just need patience and time to wait for green card. \n\nSo why one year of OPT for STEM major is not enough? It's really to short a period to contribute things significantly to a company or society. Just look at the new fresh one year old employee around ourselves, one year opt puts the alarm in people's mind that this guy might leave soon so I cannot make full use of his potential or before I can train him/her to be a eligible candidate, he/she had to leave.The difficulty of studying STEM major makes people to have more time to develop the useful skills in their job position.\n\nThe rule originally applying to STEM major students only have indicated that US needs lots of engineering, science, math workers to help develop their country. It's opposite to Singapore, where a small country doesn't need to build their own planes, cars and chains of industry. An interesting phenomenon is that both countries (US, Singapore) have criticism about foreign workers occupying high paid local position. Ironically, the truth is that there is not enough people locally are interested to learn this knowledge. The gap has to be filled by someone. That's where foreign students come from.\n\nAnother problem is related with H1B cap each year, extending the OPT definitely helps foreign students to apply H1B. So what kinds of people the US society want to fill the H1B cap each year? The voluntary non-immigrant foreign students who is studying at US college or university, been well educated by US value and also contributing a lot to local economy and culture or other foreign people you have no idea of their background when reading their H1B application?\n\nIt's obvious that when we narrowed the way for foreign students at US to get H1B, there will be other persons filling the cap.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gaofeng Fan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7718", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The United States is always known for being a melted pot, where elites and talents from all over the world collaborate and make this country grow.

Yes, John is competing with an international student with a weird last name for a job in computer sciences.

Now let's consider the consequence of this result. The company gets a more efficient worker, and it became more profitable, enabling it to provide better products than other competitive companies in the world at a better price level. The more profitable they become, the more they will be willing to invest more in their company, which will provide more jobs.

Once the OPT extension is cut, then they will choose other countries for further study. And also, US universities currently have a lot of international students and universities need them for financial reasons. Once these students leave, the tuition and fee for domestic students will go up and may cause less education in next generation and damage U.S economy in the long term.\nSecond, the OPT provides students with an opportunity to work in the U.S. They are not hurting the U.S. economy, to the contrary, they are helping the U.S. economy. Cutting the OPT extension will hurt U.S. economy because a lot of new grads will be forced to get laid off and go back to their national origin. And they also leave with newest technology in their mind. Technologies in different areas will be taken away, such as IT, civil engineering, physics, chemics.\nThird, the U.S is an immigrant country. And to be a student then a worker is always like the first step to become an U.S citizen. Cutting the OPT extension may cause U.S a lot of talented students and workers, such the foundation of this great country may be lost.\nThese are my opinions. I do not think cutting OPT is a good move. And the appropriate time period for OPT should be around 18 months to 24 months.

During my OPT, I involved in several research projects to study and develop state-of-the-art numerical algorithms using advanced mathematics to solve computationally intensive, stochastic dynamical problems, which not only contributed to the field of real industry development in U.S., but also led to publications in top-ranking journals and conferences in the field of computational mathematics.\nThe recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. Especially for me, this experiential learning will give me opportunities to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom and research lab with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network.

Before I came to US, I had several choices to pursue my Master's degree. ( US, Canada, France etc..) One of the reason why I choose USA is that the US is having this OPT extension rule that allows international students to gain more experience. If this OPT extension rule is cancelled for some reason, there will be a strongly negative effect for those international students to choose US universities among all the options they have. Also, the tuition from international students is a big portion of income for those universities and the international students are also supporting the US universities to keep ranking top all over the world. Without this new OPT extension rule, there will be very negative effects to the US universities.\n\nFurther more, as an employee of the company, there is a large portion of employees who are in OPT STEM status right now. If the OPT extension is somehow canceled, there will be very negative effect to the company. Not only the company I'm working at, but also all the high tech companies, who are hiring international students, and absorbing the intelligence all over the world to maintain their competence. In short term, the company are losing large portion of their employees immediately, and lots of ongoing projects can not go on, which will cause financial problems to the company. Long term wise, those tech companies may slowly loose their competence. As a fact of semiconductor industry, the leader in the industry can get almost 98% of the revenues from the market. And we all understand how bad it will be if the company lost the competence in the market.\n\nFinally, as a residence in California, I know that the tax that OPT students paid is also a big amount of Federal and CA state income. If we start to lose international students, the bad economical effect taken on high-tech companies will also reflect to the government. I'm not sure how much it will be, but it may be a disaster. \n\nWith this new STEM extension rule, not only the universities can keep being attractive to the best international students and maintaining the reputation as well as the support to the government in terms of scientific research, all the high-tech companies can maintain their competence in this intensely competing market better. It is the company's decision to hire international students or US citizens, and the STEM rule has nothing to do with this decision. The STEM rule, however, just give the company a better choice to chose the most competitive candidates that can be the most suitable for the specific job, which is the key of maintaining competence in the market.

I believe even if we may have some anti-culture shock to at the very beginning, we can still succeed, because our experience made us tougher and stronger, made us more analytical and mature.\n\nUS has been considered as #1 country in the world, because US holds the most advanced technology. A diversity of people from all over the world was making that happen, those immigrant made the dream come true. Think about 10 years ago, does anyone have a vision of smart phone? A touch-screen computer? Do you know how many scientists and engineers from other countries were behind this? If US has the ambitious to stay outstanding in 20 years, the Americans need to welcome the high-educated people, the Americans need to give us the opportunities to build the country and make contributions.

Most companies running on US either reserve lots of technical positions for US students due to security issues or place priority to US students when recruiting. For example GE and Comcast, they do not recruit international students for 99 percent of their STEM positions.  \n\nAccording to some observations, in some US top 20 engineering graduate schools, US students not only enjoy different kinds of scholarships reserved for them and they have bigger opportunities to get intern and job offer, which require much larger efforts from their international peers to gain same opportunities.   \n\nIf international students are forced back to their original country, which will in return cause job loss in US.\n \nFor example, Internet companies in China now are able to offer about 40-60k USD / year for 2-3 year experience engineers. And salary kept fast growing in China in recent years, many Chinese engineering students are already becoming indecisive regarding where to go. If OPT extension is revoked,  US educated international engineering students will be forced to go back to contribute to companies in their original countries, US companies might lose their advantages over those competitors. The capability of making profit of US companies will be weakened. To reduce cost, US tech companies will try to establish more offices in China and India, Thus the job opportunities will shift from US into China and India. I am sure that is not what US STEM students want to see. \n\nIf international students are forced back to their original country, which will in return cause TUITION INCREASE in public universities.\n\nAccording to survey, international students averagely pay three or four times of in-state tuition. Graduate schools in some public Universities have less than half international students but those international students contribute much more than in-state students do in terms of tuition. If OPT-Extension is revoked, I foresee that many international students will choose other countries to study in stead of coming to US. Thus many US schools will be subject to severe tuition income loss.

I am currently working on 12 month OPT program. The recent court decision on cancellation of 17 month STEM OPT extension has caused a lot of distress to me and tens of thousands of other students on OPT. \n\nMy employer had planned to apply for my H1B visa on April 2016 since I had the option of 17 months STEM OPT extension after the initial 12 month OPT. My employer would have definitely applied for H1B in April 2015 had we known STEM OPT extension was going to be cancelled and I actually had only 12 months OPT. The ruling is so sudden and unfair and it has left thousands of students like me with no other option but to leave the country on February 2016 if a new STEM extension rule is not implemented by then. \n\nInternational students with STEM degrees add great value to the United States workforce especially in the technical fields. I was glad to see the DHS had proposed a new rule which will allow STEM graduates to apply for a 24 month OPT extension. I urge the government to implement the new proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension as it will hugely benefit both the United States economy and provide STEM students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in their specific technical fields for an additional 24 months.\n\nRegards,\nAshwin Karpur Bhaskar", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ashwin Karpur Bhaskar", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3185", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant student with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.\n\nU.S.A is well known for it's education quality and has a lot of great programs which make great contributions to establishing high academic reputations.

This plan will apparently benefit the international STEM students at the first place, and it will provide tremendous benefit for the US's long term development in science, engineering and high-technology fields, which is crucial for the economy of this country and will ultimately benefit everyone living in U.S (including all the citizens).\n\nI would like to share the following perspectives regarding to the new OPT rule:\n\n1. The expanded OPT rule will keep U.S. as an attractive country for foreign talents to come and study. First and foremost, U.S. is a country that is built and developed by immigrants, and historically international students have had tremendous contributions for this country in the fields of STEM. There is not doubt that the advanced development of science, engineering and high-technology strongly leverages on international talents. Granting the foreign students a decent OPT program will allow them to keep contributing in their specialized fields, which is a great benefit to keep U.S. strong in STEM.\n\n2. On the contrary, if the OPT program falls back to the ancient one that has only one year duration, I believe many, if not all of the international students will be discouraged to come to U.S. Such a step-back of the policy will not only be against the U.S. attitude of welcoming all the foreign talents to come and contribute, it will also cause a significant loss of highly-skilled workers in STEM. For example, tens of thousands workers in Google, Facebook, Amazon and other prominent high-tech companies will be forced to leave the country if the rule falls back to one-year. This can potentially cause a chaotic situation in these companies, and making a considerable negative impact on their business development, and even the overall economy of U.S.. Given that the current high-tech industry is highly replying on the highly-skilled international workers, it is crucial for the policy makers to understand the cost of losing them.\n\n3. It is understandable that one may consider the new OPT rules as a threat to the local workers. However, it appears clear from the proposed rule that the validity of the OPT extension stays well in the realm of protecting the US workers - the employers will have to verify that no US workers will lose their job because of the job for an OPT worker. While one can hardly argue that one job is created exclusively for local workers or for the internationals, it is greatly appreciated this concept of protection for the US workers is stated in the proposed rule.\n\nIn summary, I am in full support of this proposed OPT rule based on the consideration of the long-term benefit of U.S. society (including both internationals and US citizens). Once again, I would like to stress that it is CRUCIAL for the U.S. to stay as an attractive place to the international talents, and this proposed rule will greatly enhance this aspect.\n\nMichael Cheng", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael Cheng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22164", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this new proposed regulation.

It will be beneficial not only to the F-1 visa students and American companies, but also to the general public.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to point out that lots of the opposite comments here are just Copy & Paste from several anti-immigration websites, such as http://www.stopoverreach.com/, they dont even know whats OPT. I do hope the people left comments here have a basic understanding of the issue, not only just a tide of emotion. \n\n1.\tWho will be affected by this STEM-OPT issue? Only the students with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math degrees. It is estimated by U.S. Department of Education (http://www.ed.gov/stem) that the projected percentage increases in STEM jobs in 2010~2020 is 14% for all occupations (16% in Math, 22% in Computer science, 32% in Systems and software developers, 36% in Medical scientists and 62% in Biomedical engineers). There is a huge demand in these areas, however, it is said .Yet today, few American students pursue expertise in STEM fieldsand we have an inadequate pipeline of teachers skilled in those subjects. So the people who left opposite comments should be aware that the jobs in the STEM areas have never been filled up, thats why they should not be warried about the things like Robbing my job. \n\nFor example, I know several friends working for a small clinical trial consulting company, it needs a lot of math major students to do statistical analysis for all the trials. Since its just a starting company, they can rarely hire American students (even its near a local university). The only reason they recruit international students is they have great skills and can finish their job quickly, not for the tax things.  \n\n2.\tOne year OPT has little benefit to both the international students and the company/ public. As we all know, most of the STEM jobs are difficult and do need heavy training and experience. Suppose I was an international student who is looking for a foreign country to get further education, I would definitely not choose U.S if I already known there is just one-year working opportunity, even I choose to get the education in U.S, I would not waste my time to work here just for one year, I prefer to go back to my own country to start building up my network (as we all know, the more time you live in foreign countries, the less likely you will be able to adapt to your own county). \n\nIf I was a recruiter in STEM company, I know the international students can only work for one year, and then they have high possibility to leave U.S,  I dare not to take this risk to get the international students, even they have much stronger skills, professional background and can potentially contribute more to the company and community. \n\n3.\tThe fact is most STEM students in advanced degree (MS, PhD) are very competitive in their own countries already, they will be very helpful to the entire American industry and society. However, if the immigration policy is so hard to them, they will choose the other countries with more comfortable policy, such as Singapore, Australia, Canada, Japan, etc.  \nThe world is changing so rapidly, especially in the tech world, minutes count. The negative effect of tight immigration policy to international students will appears very quickly, maybe in just a few years. History from all countries tell us that opening makes improvement, however, closing down makes recession. If U.S still wants to be the leader of science and technology in the world, it has to attract the elites (students + workers) from all over the world, and STEM OPT is actually the one standing in the center of this rule. \n\nAll in one word, I strongly agree with this new policy, its approval will quickly turn out to be real economic and technical bonus, and benefit everyone.   \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiao Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17600", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "supportsupportstrongly support", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by yushan Luo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15026", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think the rule is good for both STEM students and America.\n\nInternational students with good education background and high academic performance is making America better off instead of getting worse, from industry to academic. \n\nCompared the 8million unemployed people in US, the number of STEM students is nothing at all, not to mention stealing jobs from native Americans. \n\nCompared to the total number of openings from industry to academic, even 100% STEM students get employed will still leave a huge number of opennings, not to mention only <20%(if lucky) STEM students will finally get working Visa from lottery and stay here.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cindy Chin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5909", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this proposal definitely.\n\nMy son is an engineer and unfortunately he got a occupational disease: vibration disease.

The selective young international graduates with high level technical skills can provide additional labor force to the high-tech industries including IT, Bio-Tech, Life Science, Data Science and scientific research. The improvement in these technology will improve the overall economy output and  provide a better foundation for the social welfare. Remember In the past 100 years, the technological advance is essentially one of the most important factors for our country to be great. And now, for such  a developed country and economy, the key for a GDP growth is still the technological innovation, not only the improvement of the unemployment rate and the capital spending. Take Japan and some European countries as your bad examples.\n\nA small portion of the labor force, mostly those who works in high-tech industry might be hurt in the short term by the competition from the international students, but the effect is reduced with the setting of STEM. That's because employers usually prefer the U.S. graduates over the international graduates with the same credentials because of the language and cultural consideration. International STEM student will only be hired when there are no or not enough qualified American graduates. In other words, STEM international does not directly compete with our college graduates in high tech industry.

These indicates that the foreigner are playing very pivot role in U.S. \nInternational student didn't gain the job by earning a low salary, instead they are mostly employed in high-end technology company.

They can also benefit the companies that hire them with their multi-cultural backgrounds. Many international students choose the US over the UK or other countries for because of this very opportunity.

It is not surprising that 80% of the students in technology-related Grad schools are foreigners.

Being an attractive destination for higher education brings US a lot of benefits. The revenue increases of universities are due to the dramatic increases of the number of students who are willing to come to US to study. The increasing number of students also contribute to the local economy, such as house renting, all sorts of service requirement, travel and cultural exchange benefit. Moreover, the increasing needs for third industry because of the foreign students may also contribute to decreasing the unemployment in the United States. Therefore, remaining attractive with the 24 month extension to F-1 Non-immigrant students are beneficial to US.\nLast but not the least, allowing the F-1 non-immigrant students to work for several years in US is a smart way to take advantage of the best years of working from those young people who are ambitious, diligent, and smart.

I just finished my master degree in information science this May. I'm now working as a full time employee in a technology company under my OPT and I will back up my comment with my personal story.\n\n1. Finding a job in US as an international student is way harder than domestic student. In my master program, there are in total 43 student, almost half international and half domestic students. My international classmates and I started job hunting earlier last December, however many of them didn't get any offers when graduated in May. In contrast, my domestic classmates started looking at late March or April got plenty of job interviews and offers at ease. If you've been through the strenuous process of job hunting, you will know a simple fact: most of the companies will filter out international students at early stage to avoid OPT and visa issues. Thus it is ridiculous for argument like \"international STEM students are occupying US citizens' job opportunities\". In fact, non-citizens are way more discriminated in terms of finding a job.\n\n2. Low wage for OPT students is not a case for me and my company. When offered with the position in my current company, I did lots of research of my salary and came to know that I'm paid almost same of US employees. When attending the company orientation about insurance, 401k and benefits, I am all along with my newly hired US colleges. We had no differences in job benefits. Hence I believe there is no cost can be saved when hiring me, compared to hiring any other US citizens. We are treated equally in my company. Also my friends in other companies are telling the same story. Therefore, those who argued that companies are trying to cut cost to hire more international employees are not true.\n\n3. Extended STEM OPT and Cap-Gap Relief could really benefit both international students and the companies. As for me, I started my OPT this June and it will end the first 12-month period June, 2016, which is obviously not sufficient time either for me to get enough training, or for my company to see my potential. Hundreds of thousands of companies and students are in the same situation. If no proper extension offered, those employment will face an forced ending. A great number of students will have to leave US. Huge amount of financial loss will be caused to companies which hired them. This definitely gonna be a strong blow to US economy.\n\n4. It is immigrants that made US a great country. This might sound irrelevant to the discussion, however, if we look back to history we will see all talents around the globe coming to US for their American Dream. They appreciate the value of freedom and democracy and worked day and night to make their own contributions to this country. In fact, many of whom posted opposite opinions here are also offspring of immigrants decades ago. I'm not blaming them here, I'm asking for empathy. Me and other thousands of students here in US are also legal residents. We are working hard, paying tax and contributing to US economy in our way, like all the people of past generations who thrived on this land. We deserve better.\n\nThanks to DHS for the new proposed regulation for OPT STEM extension and Cap-Gap Relief.

U.S. pride itself being the country that attracts the best talent around the world. One major advantage U.S. education has comparing to other nations, such as U.K., is that U.S. education is more practical. In classroom, we do experiments ourselves instead of just listening to the lectures; Outside classroom, we have CPT and OPT program to enhance our understanding of knowledge with practical experience. Extending the OPT program for STEM areas would definitely increasing the compatibility of U.S. education and attracting more talented students to U.S.,thus increasing the income and student body quality for U.S. universities. In the meanwhile, international students become u.s.consumers. They will need to buy cars, clothes, products, and travel while in U.S., thus helping U.S. economy. Besides that, this extension program is not for all international students, it's for students who are in STEM field, which companies couldn't find enough domestic labor. For non-STEM field workers, this proposal would not make them have to compete with international students. It's only because there's demand from STEM firms that cannot be satisfied by U.S. citizens, thus they reach out to international students who have solid education background and skills.Only with desired amount of labor, can U.S. firms achieve the company target and boost U.S.economy in the desired scope. This program also only extend OPT program for another year. It does not make international students legal workers after that. There are other system such as H1B cap, lottery, green card system that limit the number of students who can stay at U.S. longer. Many of the students will still leave U.S. and go back to their home country with the top education and skills, which makes them great leaders in the companies,thus benefiting U.S.universities having more prominent alumnis around the world.

If a student just graduated without any working experience, how can he find a full time job? It is necessary to have a period of intern for them to get familiar with real life job.\n\nThirdly, a lot of US citizens complain about losing job but they refuse to self-examination. Why employers prefer international student while they need to pay for their visa? It's because international students are smart and hard working so they have better productivity to create more value for the employers. \nThose who complain about losing job should NOT blame those who can work better than them but try to improve themselves. To say the least of it, I dont believe those who dont want to self-examine can reach the height of international students.\n\nFourthly, the image of international students are paid low salaries is wrong. The salary was under the examination of DHS and it must be higher than the average level in the industry. In another words, they elevated the average payment instead of lower it. It proved that international students are more valuable than at least half of US citizens. Can anybody say the lower half people are useless?

Also, I believe the reason for most international students applying OPT is because we want to have a better work experiences which can helps we to have better opportunities when we back to our home-country. (Because U.S economy is the best all over the world and that is what globally believes, also China, and holding U.S internship give us a better terrace).

(And most international students very unlikely to stay, even they stay, that have very small amount. They will back to their home-country in the future, because this is not the place we belonged to) Expanding OPT is not thing related to IMMIGRATION, and even people able to stay here, that means THEY HAVE THE GREATER ABILITY THAN OTHERS (Which can provide a greater contribution to U.S) but nothing else.

It's long past the time where the united states could stand idle while the rest of the world slowly gets up to speed.

Most stay in the US for the freedom and the greatness this country enjoys over the world sure, but salary is a major concern too. Therefore, the claim that more STEM student lowers the minimum wage or any wages at all is both unproven and against common sense. \n\nMoreover, STEM jobs ARE abundant. Unlike other fields where the positions opened are relatively stable, companies that rely on innovation keeps growing and are always looking for people with the right expertise. This is a great age for science and discoveries, and those who say that American jobs are taken simply don't realize that with a great technological advantage at hand, more jobs are created.  \n\nThe final fact is then why 24 months. Yes, it use to be 12, and yes, most people quietly get along with the system. But the sad fact is that even though many talented workers are having their time of life with their career, a substantial number of them had to leave their jobs abruptly with no other reason than missing out on a lottery.

Those who can get a job offer in the US are always the excellent ones among the graduates. They would devote much to the US industry. It is widely believed that international students do not have privilege during their interviews. It is indeed their excellence won them the job offers. It should be absolutely admitted that employing those excellent students would do much better to the companies and industry.\n\n2. The main reason why most of students coming to the US to study ---- is the globally-leading universities and colleges in the US that attract students from all over the globe. However, we have to admit that there also exist nice universities in other countries competing ---- such as the ones in UK, Germany, etc ---- in spite of this, students are still keeping heading to the US. The reason primarily lies on that US is offering long OPT or more working opportunities. For students in STEM, a longer OPT would much definitely attract them to decide to come to the US for study and work at the leading technology companies, like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. These would benefits not only the US universities, companies but also many other people ---- like the landlords renting houses to international students, etc.\n\n3. There are so many student who is currently in their OPT-Extension. A cancellation of the Extension and driving them out immediately would undoubtedly result in terrible impact for their employers: currently ongoing projects may be suspended, departments in the company may be re-organized, etc. Furthermore, such a \"compulsive withdrawing after offering\" would do nothing good to government's reputation.\n\n4. Most of the STEM international students are the ones who are not only excellent in their academic majors but also with strong financial support from their family. They are typically with good social status in their native countries so that they form a strong group whose network can much influence the industries in their native countries.

Although it is true that extending OPT from one year to three years expends the pool of available workers, citizens still have huge advantages over foreigners when finding a job. \n\nI recently graduated with Master's degree in Statistics. It was the two American students in our department who got their jobs before graduation. Most of the foreign students struggled to find a job even after the graduation. Our program also provides intern opportunities to the second-year graduate students, but not all of us can get this intern. Those two American students are two of the students who interned during the second year. Similar situation happens to the previous students. Some foreign students couldn't find a job and went back to their home country. But I never heard of an American who couldn't find a job after they graduate.\n\nIn my opinion, companies definitely prefer to hire American students. First, they have better communication skills since they are native speakers. Although the science majors don't require lots of communication skills at work, the job is still part of the business and a better communication absolutely make a candidate stands out during the interview. Second, foreign students only have a few years eligibility to work in the U.S. So why the company wants to hire someone who has so much uncertainty instead of someone whose family and friends are around here and he/she can work at this position as long as he/she wants?\n\nOPT needs to be extended to three years. No company wants to spend training cost to someone who can only work for one year. If there is only one year of OPT, it almost equals to zero because most of the foreign students couldn't find a one-year job and they will go home.

The Original intent of the OPT Program was to give foreign students tools that would help their home countries when they returned home, however this program today is being used by these students as a bridge to remain in the U.S. Employers are also using the OPT Program to get around the H 1-B cap. The DHS proposal runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT Program.\n\nThere is already an extremely excessive number of foreign students in the OPT program and it increases yearly. Employers are given incentives to hire them and this undermines the opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nAlso, employers do not pay FICA or Medicare taxes on the OPT Students and these same students are holding jobs in the$60,000-90,000 a year range and they cost the US Taxpayers about $1 Billion a year. This is preposterous.\n\nOn a variety of measures former foreign students have equal, and many times lesser talents than their American peers. This is unfair to Americans. If the US needs foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do they need to be trained? And if special training is given to them, why can't this special training be given to American's instead?\n\nDHS frequently defines recent college graduates as students which allows the student and the employer to be free from payroll taxes thus penalizing Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly and this affects our elders indirectly.\n\nJobs should be given to American workers first and foremost.

Why STEM needs extension\nSTEM is the base of all development, those people who are working in this area do all the practical jobs and make real changes to the world. We need extension because these areas need more time to practice, to be proficient of, and to make a change. These areas are so complicated that they need really smart people, lots of experience, also interested in all the technical stuff, and lots of people like this. Take internet or your laptops or whatever you can pick up around you, see how many changes it has from 10 years ago, this will give a coarse view of how many efforts it needs. For STEM students, a short term practice is not enough because of the requirement of these areas. If we still have the original purpose of why OPT policy exists, we need to consider extending it for STEM areas, not only for these areas' complexity, but for the changes they can make and the importance for the U.S.\n\n2. VISA problem\nFor those who still want to work in the U.S. after OPT ends, a H1-B VISA is what they need. However, look at the policy that currently exists for people who need to transfer from OPT to H1-B: people need to put their documents into UNFAIR LOTTERY and compete their luck on a chance of their documents to be reviewed. I mark it UNFAIR here because there are so many tricks to improve the chances to win the lottery, which are not legal from law point of view but still there're no effective ways to control them. For example, there're companies that do nothing but help people \"get hired\" under many \"companies\", so that people who pay them can get multiple tickets in the lottery, and increase their chances. People are faced with increasingly complicated issues in this area, what makes it worse is that usually people only get two chances in April to jump into the lottery based on 17 months OPT. If we can extend it to 24, more people would have 3 chances into lottery, this may ease the pain of H1-B lottery. I know it may not be a final solution of VISA problem, but at lease people who are suffering from a VISA issue would love to see they have one more chance to win.\n\n3. Be attractive for upcoming students\nUniversities know better than me for sure, about why they need more international students in their school. A friend of mine from Illinois told me the reason of that, because they have crazy number of international students in their university recent years. International students pay MUCH more(triple tuition fee at lease) than local students, plus their daily spent and high desire to purchase, they bring a minimum of 100 MILLION dollars each year for a small town just from educational point of view. What's more important? The money is not coming from the U.S., those are the income for the entire country. An extension of OPT will of course attracts more international students to this country and continuously dragging the local economy up. Students do not want their money to be taken and kicked off the country immediately after graduate. For those who have an educational mortgage, the extension means faster and more debt they can pay off, and definitely makes U.S. more attractive.\n\nI hope my opinion can be reviewed by government agents and hopefully make a change on a better and more friendly working environment for all people like me and tens of millions of other non-immigrants.

In fact a 2013 study from the EPI found proved there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. The true intent of this plan is to suppress wages in tech-related fields.\n\nIts bad enough today with many companies abusing {H-1B} to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring US citizens at prevailing US wages - especially in software or tech areas. As a female tech worker over 50, in the business for well over 20 years, I know this first hand - have had my own and others jobs outsourced, my own wages reduced. \n\nThis plan will ensure foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need and categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes which provides an unfair incentive for companies to hire them. \n\nThis rule will exasperate a bad situation - it is open to every foreign person in the world, seeking the cheapest, not the brightest. It is an employment program for and only for foreign students -  U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM. \n\nThat is OBSCENE!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by April McCurry", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3656", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This will be beneficial to U.S economy  because students in STEM can contribute to the United States rather than going back to their counties immediately.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ruiye  Qian", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0395", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}], "totalNumRecords": 22582}

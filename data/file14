{"documents": [{"openForComment": true, "commentText": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. The DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. It runs counter to the needs of the American worker.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers. As a result OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.\n\nOPTs sought after by employers because they are usually younger and most significantly, much much cheaper than their American competitors, save employers 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nBy increasing the time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - amazingly same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established an illegal shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent. If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? Young /americans desperately in need of Jobs! OPT, in short, expands the pool of cheaper workers, at the expense of American workers. This is how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring cheaper foreign workers who are replacing Americans workers. Not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.\n\nAn Economic Policy Institute study found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. But by\nencouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. there is one absolutely certain major impact, the study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\n\nIn the end, this Regulation fails to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regulation, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for fraud leaves the victimized American without proper compensation, recourse or the jobs they so desperately need. \n\nOf course, the message this Regulation is sending loudly and clearly is that only foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is a lie. \n\nThe purpose of immigration is not and should never be to take the jobs needed by Americans away from Americans for a cheaper non-citizen alternative. This legislation is a despicable, Unconstitutional insult to the American worker.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cheryl Little", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4887", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "YES.\n\nI fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months.

There are not many U.S. citizens choose to study in IT, math, science or other fields related to STEM, and most of U.S. citizens who have STEM degree would be hired prior to students who hold F-1 visa. Therefore, in terms of competition,  I believe it's more like an unfair competition to foreign students.

Many people holds opposite views pointed out that:'' OPT removed a lot of many from SSN or other benefit, and tax payers pay extra to feed those foreigners.\" When I interned in U.S. I paid for SSN and medicare using my paycheck, and I believe a lot of F-1 students did same as me.

The benefits of this would go to the foreign students themselves who would have a much greater chance of getting a job and a green card that would lead to America citizenship and to those who would employ them and to the people who employ them.  These employers often pay less or expect more work from such foreign workers.  Attempts to force exploitative employers to play by the rules have failed in the past and I believe they will continue to fail.  The employers want to save money too much, the foreign workers are too desperate to get a green card to complain.\n\nThere benefits to American workers of such an broad-based and accommodating policy are not only not evident to me, I believe that these current proposed changes would work to hurt American workers and American students.\n\nIf we make it too easy for American employers and universities to tell potential foreign students that if they can only get their foot in the door at an accredited American university and graduate that there's a job for them and eventual citizenship, we will have millions more foreign students here to do just that.  How on Earth would there be any jobs left for Americans if our universities become filled with millions of foreign students who came here determined to work here and never go home?\n\nIt all comes down to fairness and numbers.  \n\nIt is not fair to make it so easy to get an American job that foreign students of average or below average ability can compete with American students and American workers.  \n\nIt is impossible for the US to have enough jobs to accommodate these proposed changes.  The only way that lots more foreign students can get jobs after attending and graduating from American educational institutions is for our government to remove the necessary and desirable protections that keep American citizens employed in full time, good paying jobs. \n\nWe have many challenges in today's America.  \n\nMaking it easier for American employers and American colleges to help wealthy parents in foreign countries to get their children established here in America on a permanent basis so that they can eventually become American citizens -- is no solution for any problems that the American people have.\n\nIt will only make their problems worse.\n\nFor these reasons, I completely oppose the goals of these rule changes and completely disagree with the goals of the employers, educational institutions and the other special interests who suggested them.\n\nAny rule changes along the lines being proposed here today would have to be highly targeted and limited to top students,   top academic programs and jobs that absolutely require a high level of knowledge and unusual abilities to be fair to Americans and truly beneficial to them.  \n\nNothing should be changed that does not benefit American citizen students and American citizen workers.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joan Konkle", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4886", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Quality Higher Education is the backbone for any country.

In my experience in graduate school, I have learned first-hand that there is a glut, not a shortage, of Americans interested in these fields. When I was working on my Master's Degree, I was in a program where I saw a number of strong American students who did not get accepted to any of the Ph.D. programs they applied to. I myself only got into two out of eight that I applied for when I went for my Master's and 2 out of 7 when going for Ph.D. programs. More than 40% of the graduate students in that department where I got my Master's were foreign. The inescapable conclusion from this was that Americans who are interested in STEM fields are being crowded out by foreign students. Opportunity for physics Ph.D.'s is very limited upon graduation.

The most appealling part from US was the trainning oppotunities in industry during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. Therefore, for sake of the income of universities in US, the OPT extension is a key factor to attract those students all over the world to apply for the universities and pay the tuition, which is a great part of the income of the universities, with which the unversities can sponsor more scholars on researches to advance technology to improve the life of US citizens.\n\nApart from the aspects of the universities, if this rule is terminated by some reason, it's definitely a huge disaster to many US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. More than half of the engineers are or were international STEM students, and a termination of the OPT extension will force large amount of the labor force in those companies to leave US.

In the same time, the rule expands consideration of influence of local U.S. Workers, making it a fair job environment for both the US workers and stem students.\nFirst, the rule increases requirements for employers participating in STEM opt extension and strengthen the e-verify program. This makes sure the participating employers are those who can afford the fixed and variable costs of STEM opt extension and have the scale big enough to make profit from hiring international students after the costs. Meanwhile, those employers that are excluded from the STEM opt extension program leave all its employment opportunities to U.S. local workers, building up a protection barrier for the U.S. local workers.\nSecond, the opt extension program focuses on specific disciplines of STEM, and it's intrinsic need of the STEM related companies to have a longer opt extension which enables international students to work for a longer period. The STEM disciplines are all around the topic of science and technology, the disciplines which require long-term research and study. Thus, results and skills obtained from these disciplines are hard to build. We can't expect a worker in STEM related industry like Data analysis and software developing to achieve proficiency within a year or even shorter time. So it's in the employers' benefit to provide longer working permission for their employees.

It's essential for the nation to make use of global talents.\nFour, we need to focus on the fact that many of the international students in STEM disciplines couldn't have related jobs back to their home country. This fact is a reflection of the world's undevelopment and unfairness. As the most developed and powerful nation, America should undertake the responsibility to bridge the difference between different parts of the world and eliminate the unfairness globally by endowing these students access to the high-tech industries here.\nIn a word, the new rule for STEM opt extension deserves the attention and acceptance, for it will help nourish the high-tech industries which builds up the unparalleled advantage of the nation and show the world its commitment to close the gap between the world.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Edward Wei", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10883", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "While I support this rule what about having a condition in place ?

Technology in US are improving more faster than past when there were few international students. The reason for that is not only US has pro elites but also international students are doing irreplaceable work in data analysis, collection, testing and so many basic works. The speed for moving forward for this country will get much slow If no more international students were doing these basic work since US cannot find out these much people who want to do the work and are able to do.\n3. A lot of positions are creating for citizens from economy growing fast. Nowadays, many new companies grown up and more will born in the future in which more than 80 percentage of positions are only for citizens and the left 20 percentage of positions are the basic works.

It gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students instead of Americans. I oppose it and urge you to reconsider and abandon it.\nTwo shocking facts about the OPT program are that OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is most often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    \tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    \tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes\nUnder the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year\n    By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that his rule sets up a de facto, but not legislated by Congress, H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\n    \tThe proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n   \tAfter the GAO issued its report in 2014, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa  wrote to you and asked you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. He also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\n    OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Norman Black", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3813", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Hello,\n\nSince we have the lowest labor participation rate since the 1970s, I suggest that we put American citizens to work first over foreign citizens and students.

I strongly support this proposal because as far as my concern, it is an all-win policy.\n\nFirstly, when International students chose the country all around the world to spend their college/ graduate time, the practical training opportunities will have a huge impact of their decisions. As we all know, technologies make our world flat,  there's less and less knowledge barriers nowadays, if want the students want is just the knowledge on books, there's no need to spend so much and travel so far to learn. But practical experience can not learn from books, that's the reason people want to study abroad and even spend so much and decide to leave home. I believe at this point, USA's OPT policy is the main reason make USA is the most popular destination of study abroad. Without OPT and its extension policy, I believe USA will quickly loss its advantage of the competition and be surpassed by other competitors finally loss the opportunity of the fast growth of its education industry.\n\nSecondly, I can not say the depression of education industry will bring USA a whole economy depression, however we can see what the International students bring to USA. Education industry, for only the school tuition and fees, they spent serval thousands dollar per year. Really estate industry, every students will spend serval hundreds or thousands dollars on the house rental, we can easily find the support evidences from the rental price changes. Transportation industry, as far as I know the international students around me, at least half of them will but vehicle, at least one international flight per year, serval domestic travel in US per year, metro public transportation every day! They also need food, drink, entertainment, health services, clothes, shoes, heat etc. So, let's think, how much money they spent in US and many job opportunities do they bring to US? I believe time will be harder if so many customers or potential customers have to leave just because of the cancellation of the extend OPT.\n\nThirdly, these people will largely help US' high tech and high value-added industry which I think is and will be the core competitiveness of this country. As far as I know, most of the students who choose study abroad were very outstanding students in their own country, plus US' schools' admission filter, the people who study abroad are expected the future elite of their own society. They are the precious priceless fortune of the human society, If they have the OPT extension, they will stay in US longer and contribute more to US, which will largely enhance US' country competitiveness in the International world.\n\nGenerally, I think US' whole country and society will benefit a lot from passing this proposal.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYuanpei Cao\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuanpei Cao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20686", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I fully support the extension for F-1 students.

On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit all US Citizens here.\n\nI doubt that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries. First of all, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they got caught. Second, US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsorship - which is $5000 - from those tech companies. Most of the STEM jobs/ highly-paid jobs want US. Citizen only. Tons of company won't even be willing to give foreign students interview opportunities. I've heard enough from my friends, that those interviewers kept saying \"you are great/you are perfect, but we only hire US. Citizen.\" So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles? If a US STEM worker cannot find a job, think about himself, maybe merely, he is not qualified, either he doesn't have required experience, or he is not a good team player. From my experience, if you are a U.S Citizen, you don't have to have any experience, the company will train you, the starting salary is around $60K. - this is real, I saw this from a really big company's website.\n\nSo, if those people really need something to worry about, this is what they are supposed to worry about: why not spending more time improving their own skills set those companies are looking for instead of wasting time leaving negative comments here? Competitions are everywhere in the world. Tech companies will never hire you if you are not qualified regardless of your citizenship!

It is impossible for employers to employ less skilled foreigners over hardworking Americans, because the cost is higher if the employer has to maintain the employee's status to let him stay in US, and the risk of the employee leaving is higher, not to mention having language and cultural problems. So if an American's skill is equal or higher than any foreigner that he compete with, he shouldn't worry about foreigners taking his job. \n\n2. There are a lot of jobs in Physics, Chemistry, and Material etc, that are so dangerous or so complicated, that most Americans are not willing to do, for example handling HF (hydrofluoric acid) or doing Heavy Metal Vapour Deposition, which is an essential part of semiconductor industry, I know because I do this and none of the Americans in our group dare to do. Many of my friends find jobs like that in industry. So make it harder for us to get these jobs would not have any benefit on economy.\n\n3. If you have been in a University or Research Institution, you can easily find that for Physics, Chemistry, Material, Computer Science people who are on top of their field, the professors and the best PhDs etc, most of them are not Americans. Making it harder for them to stay in America would definitely hurt scientific progress in general.\n\n4. Most Americans doesn't have American origin, and their parents or grandparents can be legal immigrants, America is known for freedom and accepting talented people from all over the world. There is certainly no point in looking down upon any other race and think they are inferior in any way, or intentionally mix up legal and illegal immigrants to make legal immigration look like a crime. If immigration was not allowed, many Americans may not even be here. I think as long as we prove our abilities and work hard, we should be encouraged to stay.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Haoming Jin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19807", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally support the opt-extension rule.

I think this is the regulation will increase the comprehensive national strength of US and benefit general people who lives in this country. \n\nFirst of all, it will enhance US comprehensive national strength. As we all know, the composition of international students are young, knowledgeable, and full of creativity from all over the world. If we give them 24 month opt, they will have more chances to apply for H1B VISA and stay in US and working for this county. These students are very intelligent young people from all over the worlds. In school, they study dedicatedly and often times outperform domestic students. With them working at companies in our county, it will certainly increase the competitiveness of US companies in international market. Most of the stem majors are practical, we need those talented young people to work for our company. For example, the total revenue of Google is 66 billion in 2014. For employees in Google 83 percent of them are international workers, and most of them can work here because they have the opt extension and thus can apply for H1B Visa. Without this extension, I can see a great high tech company like Google goes its way down because lack of talents. It is not only a money problems. we know the IT is the representative of technology. It plays a incredible role in national defense and security. I can foresee the tragedies like 911, Snowden and political eavesdrop happens again at the time US lost its advantages in technology. Last year, US economy increased 2.4, most of the drive is from IT. I would say, without this opt extension, US will be in a huge trouble.\n\n2. Benefit American people\nThe average salary from H1B last year is about 100,000 each year. They pay average about 15 percent of their income to US as tax. We all know US is in big amount of debt for this social welfare which gives its economy a trouble. If we keep those young people in our country and let them keep paying taxes. It will release the financial burden of US significantly. With the taxes paid by opt users, we can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research.\n\n3.Other suggestions\nActually, the opt and H1b system is not flexible enough. There are too many uncertainties caused by the identity issue. This will reduce the attractiveness of staying in US. I suggest issue all international student who graduated from a US accredited university green cards. Also, those students who are not majored in stem are also very intelligent and worth to keep, we should give them the extension.

The OPT extension and the Cap-Gap relief will not only help the international students to gain more applied experience and make more contribution to U.S., but also help alleviate the H-1B shortage which the employers are facing.  \nAfter reading some of the comments, I found most people who opposed to this proposal usually took two false premises. \nFirst, it is not true that foreign students steal jobs from Americans. The most commonly used example was OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013. The second part of this sentence was 64,000 of which are in STEM fields. Some people said that it was evidential that foreign students stole Americans jobs. However, that is only part of the story. Notice that the numbers were cumulated from 2009 to 2013. In 2013 solely, there were 5.7 million openings in STEM fields, 4.4 million of which required at least a bachelors degree. At the same period of time (from 2012-2013 academic year), according to the National Center for Education Statistics, foreign students comprised 56.9% of all doctoral degrees in engineering; 52.5% of all doctoral degrees in computer and information sciences; 50% of all doctoral degrees in mathematics and statistics; and 40% of all doctoral degrees in physical sciences and science technologies. Similarly, half of all masters degrees in STEM field were comprised by foreign students. Proportionally, more than 2 million of jobs in STEM fields could be offered to foreign students in the year of 2013. But as a matter of fact, there were only 64,000 jobs were taken by foreign students in 4 years, which also means that the employers only selected the most talent foreign students in their fields. Furthermore, according to NAFSA, international students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year (only one year). So it is not true that foreign students took Americans job opportunities. On the contrary, international students and their families have created more job opportunities for U.S. citizens.\nSecond, it is not true that U.S. government spend too much money on foreign students. The supportive evidence for this argument was OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Again, it is only one side of the story. According to NAFSA, international students and their families contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. A 5-year-old can do this simple math that international students and their families contributed more than U.S. government has ever spent on them. \nI believe DHS accepts rational criticism against their proposal, and I also strongly defend the freedom of speech. However, partially biased evidence and narrow-minded nationalism will not help construct a rational dialogue. It is emotionally understandable that it is always easier to vilify foreigners. But as an international student, it is hurtful that I have been accused to something I did not do, and our contribution has not been acknowledged. I appreciate that U.S. provides us high education and training opportunities, and I strongly support the new rule because it is justified and it is needed for both U.S. government and international students. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoran  Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17841", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "My thoughts are President Obama as well as the government as a whole have way overstepped their boundaries in so many areas.

The U.S interests me most because the OPT extension provides me enough time for professional training in big IT companies.

The overwhelming weight of research shows that in America's dynamic labor market, skilled immigrants complement their U.S.-born counterparts. Skilled immigrants' help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign workers positively impact the wages and employment opportunities of native-born workers across America's economy.\n\nSecond, one of the most important reason why America is the most powerful country is that America has led the world in science and technology for half a century. In particular, many of the high-tech workers come from foreign countries. For example, statistics from \"The Contributions of High-Skilled Immigrants by Neeraj Kaushal and Michael Fix show that 22.3% workers are immigrants(note that this record is from 2009 investigation), and Chemistry 24.8%, Medical Science 44.4% and so on.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nRajesh G", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rajesh Gali", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10833", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I just read several comments.

This means they have to go back to their own countries. Who suffers? These students, of course, but more importantly, those employers.

It shows their anger and desperation, and sarcastically most of them are not even STEM. From my experience as an international student, who is educated and have gone through the studying, job hunting and working stages. I know for sure that the companies are indeed having their priority towards American citizens given similar background in the STEM field. Therefore, I have my views of argument as follows.\n\nFirst, the STEM students, who can only take jobs in the STEM field, are educated and mostly well-supported financially. They will always be the upper middle class wherever in the world they stay anyways. Therefore they have nothing to do with American citizens from non-STEM field, which I'm sure most of the object comments are from, which is unreasonable. \n\nSecond, as far as I know from the job hunting and working environment, still in the STEM field, the American citizens are needless to say much better in presentation in the interviews, and they have a better known background. Most interviewer would know an average American high school or university, but they would only have heard of top 3 universities in another country at most. So the American and non American candidates are not even competing 'equally'. Have the STEM students been protesting about the unspoken rule of this recruiting process? Never. They still work hard and send out hundreds of resumes, and they try to compete with much better grades and hard work.\n\nThird and most importantly, the STEM students have become a major strengths of American IT companies. In other words, they are the exact reason why American IT companies are developing much more rapidly than those in any other countries. This rule, which gives the STEM students a better chance of staying longer and contributing more to this country, is the smartest and most profitable choice of America in comparison to other developed countries. I cannot imagine how many students who pay hundreds of thousands in tuitions, and in travel expenses the US would America lose if the extension doesn't exist, which will degrade the option of the US to the same level as the UK, and other European countries. \n\nAll in all, if people don't work hard, they will be obsoleted. If a country doesn't choose the best incentive for it's people to learn and work, and for it's companies to grow and profit, this country will be surpassed. The best feature of America is its freedom and diversity, which is the most important reason why it's attracting people from different cultures and backgrounds to unite and prosper over the years.

This is such a wise propose to benefit the research institution. As a leading researcher of a major corporation, I had the experience of working with a lot of talented foreign researchers who held F1 with OPT. But there has been several times when my director had to delay the project because of the termination of employment of the F1 students since they ran out of OPT time. It's such a pity for us to lose such talented and hardworking researchers simply because they were kicked out of this country by the rule made by the government of 'The land of freedom'. And we had to put so much un-meaningful effort and money to search for replacements. I have already been in 2 projects which some foreign researchers or engineers who played key role had to leave because of the end of their OPT period and not able to get an H1B visa. Both of these projects ended up being delayed because we had to find capable replacements. And millions more dollars were lost because of the delay. The new rule will definitely improve our research process, since a typical research project has a life cycle of 30 to 36 month. If they cannot stay longer, they have enough time to at least finish one project. Although I think simply changing the OPT rule cannot fully fix this dilemma that we had, it's at least a good first step of saving a lot of the research groups from being trapped into this situation.

Therefore, endowing STEM students with longer work authorization will by no means affect the United States citizens in a negative way whatsoever. Why? According to numerous studies conducted by top-notch scholars in the field of Economics, Political Science, Labor Study, etc, highly skilled foreign workers or immigrants never create competition against local workers. As we all know, the demand for highly skilled workers, especially in the field of STEM, is never met yet still rapidly growing. In such situation, allowing more foreign STEM workers does not exclude local workers from this particular job pool. Conversely, it only increases the supply of such workers, and together with local works, it helps meeting the demand and boosting the holistically economic output of the United States. With simple economics principles, the residents in the United States will benefit from a stronger Economy and have higher income.\n\nSecondly, the new STEM extension proposal does not mean it will incur a lot more long-term or permanent immigrants, as opposed to many fear. As we all know, what entitles foreign students/workers long-term work authorization is H1B and it has annual lottery system to control the total number of foreign workers who get authorized to work. It is true that the new STEM extension proposal will greatly increase the number of applicants in each year's H1B lottery, because they have a few more years to participate in the H1B lottery. But to note, every year, only a fixed number of workers can get long-term authorization and the rest still need to go back to their countries of origins after a few years, even it is a little longer under the new STEM extension proposal.\n\nTo summarize the benefits under the new STEM extension proposal:\n\n1) in the situation where the demand for high-skilled workers is far from enough, the United States will have more high-skilled workers to contribute to STEM industries in the U.S. and as a result, the entire domestic economy will recover and prosper more rapidly. They never create competition, because there is no competition in the field of STEM. They are bridging the gap between the supply and demand of high-skilled, high-productive workers.\n\n2) high-skilled workers who have relatively high salaries and pay higher taxes now will pay higher taxes for a few more years. Since they never enjoy the benefits of social securities, medicare, etc that they pay out of every of their paychecks, the taxes they pay will solely benefit the United States citizens.\n\n3) the new STEM extension proposal does not mean more immigrants whatsoever. It only means more short-term foreign workers who have to leave the United States after 2 years. It only means they will have 2 more years to create fortune for the U.S. companies, people and economy. It only means they will have 2 more years to learn hands-on experience from the U.S., the largest economy in the world, and carry it on to wherever they work after they leave the U.S. By allowing a longer opportunity of learning, the United States are doing good for the entire world.\n\nI see huge benefits that the United States and its residents will gain from the new STEM extension proposal. This proposal means opportunities to have more people to work for the U.S., to create resources for the U.S. without using them, to grow the U.S. economy, and to help them realize their dreams.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chris Ma", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12622", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The new policy will benefits both the US and the students.\nThe students won't need to worry as much for their graduation, and the US will be able to attract more intelligent students to this country.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rongzhong Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17336", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "How many of these OPT people have returned home after there visas expired? \nTell me how it is that this is GOOD for America?\nHow many American people will be with out a job because of this?\nHow much money does this take from our Social Security?\nExplain how this make sense to screw the American people?", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mark Ricks", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3213", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The OPT 24-months extension should be strongly supported considering the strong boosts brought by international students to U.S. economy, including automobile industry, real estate industry and consumer's market.

For STEM areas, no doubts, US is the leading country in the world. Our study on the most advanced technologies should not be limited on campus, the experience we gained in the high tech companies in US definitely will benefit us a lot in the future career. Without the OPT extension, within such a limited time of only one year internship, how could we actually learn something in the company? We may be asked to leave the country when we just start to get familiar with our projects, our workload, our colleagues, and our company. International students pay a lot of money to study in US which definitely help the universities to maintain and upgrade their education quality.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year in unrealized contributions.\n\n    One of the big education pushes in the United States is to increase STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education and create a workforce better suited to the jobs available in the modern era. Even schools that are not dedicated STEM schools are pushed to increase their STEM education, and other communities have cooperated to create STEM initiatives to supplement education.\n    But DHS' proposed rule would push the ones raised and trained at home out of the job market that we created these education initiatives for and hand those jobs to foreign workers who have no commitment or allegiance  to the U.S.                           \n\nThe proposed rule fails to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations.

As Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. OPT extension serves as a good bargaining chips for US when she's seeking and embracing outstanding international talents, especially in those high technology and engineering industry which is critical to the economy and society of the US.\n\nSecondly, hundreds of thousands of international students, most of whom are in F-1 status, have already chosen to enroll in U.S. educational institutions and are currently pursuing courses of study in fields that may provide eligibility for this program. Some of those students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. DHS must therefore act swiftly to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the 2008 IFR. Prompt action is particularly appropriate with respect to those students who have already committed to study in the United States, in part based on the possibility of furthering their education through an extended period of practical training in the world's leading STEM economy.\n\nLastly, as of September 16, 2015, over 34,000 students were in the United States on a STEM OPT extension. The uncertainty around the 2008 IFR will also have a effect on their employers, most of which are in technology, engineering and financial industries.

So it is completely necessary for them to have the expanding training opportunities. For example, my brother graduated from Peking university, one of the top university in China. He got offers from Imperial College and UC Davis. Finally, he chose to go to UCB for further study even without any scholarship. The reason is that his major---electrical engineering requires internship to put theory into practice. Therefore, he got lots of experience by the opportunities of OPT.\n\nBesides, this proposal can also be conducive to increasing the job opportunities and salaries for local people. Because this opportunity means that numerous students could live longer in America. They would spend their money renting a house, buying food and travelling, which naturally enhance the development of the service industry. Local people can have more opportunities to cooperate with students, thus living a better life.\n\nFinally, this opportunity is necessary for most technical company.

I believe it benefits both foreigners and Americans. \nOpponents of the OPT extension say we foreigners are stealing jobs from them. But the fact is, when I was about to graduate I submitted tens of job applications everyday, and I got rejected easily just because I'm not a US citizen. In my major, the first ones who got job offers are US citizens. The career director even asked those who are US citizens to put it on their resume so that they'd get selected by the HR. According to my own experience and that of my friends, it is much more difficult for a foreigner to get a job in the US than US citizens. In terms of we accepting lower pay, my pay in my current company is about 80k and as far as I know, it is not lower than the US citizens of my level in the company. Also, we foreigners are paying as much tax as US citizens with the same cost of living. For most of us, we pay higher interests and deposits for loans and leases because of the thin credit history. We pay for our own medical insurance because we don't have US citizen parents. We don't get jobs as easily because our US visa has an expiration date and most companies prefer long term employees. Along the way I feel more struggles than privileges living in this country. Despite all these struggles, I'm still very grateful for the opportunities and possibilities OPT and OPT extension has granted me.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in December, 2014 with a Master's degree in the field of Computer Science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \n\nThe proposal to re-institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and accomplishing through experience. Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application.Establishing goals and a professional road-map at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished.\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule-making. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nChanging temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nVeera Paruchuri", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Veera Paruchuri", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2975", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I say NO to OPT program as this program do not provide relief to the F1 Students.

I will share my story. I am an international student in Aerospace sector and I did my post graduation at MIT, and it is impossible for an international to work with leading Aerospace firms. So I completely DISAGREE that we are taking away American jobs. Once I had to get out from the middle of an interview at Boeing after they realized that I am an international even though I had all the required qualification. But I wanted to work in core Aerospace sector, so I went to Europe and worked for Boeing's rival - Airbus. \n\nHere are my two cents for why the OPT extension is justified:\n1. At least in my vast network of American friends who are well-educated and qualified, I don't know even a single person who has to sit at home. The bottom line is if you have the requisite skills, then both Americans and internationals have same opportunities.\n2. America is a land of immigrants. It just doesn't make sense for America to train young smart kids and then loose them to another country, and then hire some less qualified American.\n3. History is full of examples that so many US companies were started by non-Americans employing lots of Americans. What if they were not given the visas?\n4. I feel that lot of frustration among Americans against OPT is because of mis-information or news items like \"How Indian workers replaced 250 workers at Disney\". I have to agree, that if any company is trying to hire cheaper contract workers to cut down on costs by laying off Americans, then that is totally unethical and any relevant and any relevant legal action should be considered against such malpractices.

In my opinion this increased duration of practical training is vital for the students to fully utilise the education they have received. Moreover, STEM which typically stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) advanced degrees are areas of utmost importance  to the technological & scientific progress of USA as a nation. And it would be in the best of the interest of the nation to optimise the capabilities of people having advanced degrees in these areas. STEM advanced degrees are very specialised in nature and it takes years of education for a student to gain expertise in these specialised fields. The skill sets required to gain STEM designated education are also very niche. For example, to be able to do Masters in Computer Science the student needs to have, the 4 years duration, engineering undergraduate degree and in his high school as well he/she should have had science & mathematics subjects. Thus, a student typically going for a STEM designated advanced degree has already put in years of education in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics making them competent enough to be further able to gain expertise in these field by going for STEM designated advanced degrees. As such, these students are intellectual assets for the nation which the nation should capitalise for their own advancement and extension of OPT practically means this only.All together, this extension is imperative to maintain this nation's economic , scientific and technological competitiveness.

Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that things will always look this good in the coming years. While foreign students are still flooding to the U.S. for higher education, many have also chosen countries like China, Japan, Britain, Australia, Germany... instead. Many countries have realized the importance of foreign talents in this age of technology, and have developed policies to encourage foreign students to their academic institutions.\n\nSo how will the STEM extension policy help the U.S. ensure its academic status? The current OPT allows for one year of training after graduation. Some commenters have argued that STEM students do not need training outside of their education, which, almost anyone working in any tech industry would agree, is very far from the truth. Skills in the STEM field are very practical and require the students to know how to apply their technical knowledge to real world problems, and this \"how to apply\" part has to be learned from industry experience, and one year is very often not enough for a student to see a industrial STEM project to completion. It is very frustrating for both the student and the employer when the OPT expires in one year and a member of the team is forced to leave. The result? Employers stay away from OPT students, students move to other countries where they are allowed more complete training, and future students just go directly to those countries for education instead. And academic institutions, as we know, are the powerhouse for the country's future development. The STEM extension policies will ensure that our academic institutions stay competitive in this fast-changing world.\n\nIt is also obvious that abandoning the STEM extension will bring a shock to the high-tech industries, which have been critical in the growth of the American economy. The fast-paced nature of such industries means that companies and engineers need to stay competitive to stay on top of the game, and getting rid of good engineers after one year of service is not going to do any good to either the companies or the engineers who are in the job market - why would you work hard to improve yourself when you do not have to compete with others to secure your job?\n\nSome commenters also objected on the ground that STEM extension gives unfair advantage to foreign students than U.S. citizens. That kind of claim is very far from the truth. First, any company that is allowed to employ students on STEM extension must participate in the E-Verify program, which requires the company to not discriminate against citizens or foreigners in the hiring process. So definitely no advantage there. Second, speaking from personal experience, if there is any difference between the job seeking process for U.S. citizens and that for foreign students, it would be a disadvantage on the foreign students' side. I myself am a foreign student. I graduated from an Ivy League School, and I found it hard to find a job as a foreign citizen. Many companies only hires U.S. citizens. On top of that, if you want any training that is more than a year, you would need to apply for a company that either is in the E-Verify program (for the STEM extension) or sponsors the H1B visa. Both options require companies to spend extra money and effort in the legal and bureaucratic procedures to sponsor the student, and many companies are unwilling to do that. Based on these reasons, the STEM extension really does not give foreign students any advantage over U.S. citizens who are in the same job market.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yachen Sun", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17579", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal for extending STEM OPT to 24 months.

It allows the students to gain the kind of global exposure, the kind of interaction with intellectuals, the kind of exposure to the latest technology that they could never have gained in their own countries. No country but the US, offers this level of growth in knowledge, intellect and outlook.

The US has always been very welcoming for people from around the world and this proposal is a step further in that direction.\n\nI would also like to point out how beneficial these people are to the American economy.

International students are the main driving force behind the higher education sector and to make sure that this continues, this rule is necessary.\n\nLastly, I would like to say that the US has always been the one place that people from all over the world could come to,to learn.

In long term, I believe the extension of Optional Practical Training will make significant contribution to the U.S. economy and job market.\n\nFirst of all, from my own perspective, the high-tech industry changes really fast. The knowledge provided by schools is typically not up-to-date. It is necessary for the international students to get training in the most advanced technology companies in the world, to learn the most up-to-date skills, and to learn how to apply the theoretical knowledge from school to real-world application. Offering enough time for the training will provide great opportunity to the students to feel the trend of the fast change of high-tech industry, and to avoid being obsolete. \n\nSecondly, international students have made significant contribution to the U.S. economy. According to a report of the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 2014, international students contributed more than $27 billion to the U.S. economy. The extension of Optional Practical Training program will be a great attraction to more international students coming the the U.S., and making more contribution to the educational institutions, and finally to the overall U.S. economy.\n\nFinally, the world has become more and more open and connected. The United States, as the strongest country in the world, has the spirit of learning from different ideas, and fusing different cultures. Even though most of the international students will go back to their country after their study, they will contribute their ideas from hard working, and share their culture to stimulate innovation. This is even more important to the STEM industries. This is another aspect that the international students contribute to the U.S. economy. If the U.S. has a great economy, there will be more job opportunities for the U.S. citizens.\n\nIn summary, offering the extension of the OPT program will help the students learn how to apply gained knowledge to contribute to the world, will attract more international students to the U.S. to contribute to the U.S. educational institutions, and will contribute their ideas to stimulate the improvement of U.S. economy and job market.\n\nThanks for considering my comments.\n\nRegards,\nTeng Wang", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Teng Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14084", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "You do understand in order to get OPT you need a JOB, right?

Any longer and it becomes employment. The proposal would make it possible to have a three year training, plus the potential for an additional two years if earning a second STEM degree at a higher education level\nThe safeguarding for US workers in related fields is extremely weak in the proposal. In fact, since the requirements are so low, they actually promote the hiring of OPT trainees instead, for which companies can pay \"trainee\" type wages (minimum wage). How could a US Citizen or Permanent Resident recent graduate expect to compete for this position while saddled with student debt?\nThe costs of the standards in the proposed rule of approximately $71.7 million dollars per year to facilitate the OPT 24 month extension could be much better allocated in the form of full scholarships to US citizens and Permanent residents to study in STEM fields reducing the US reliance on foreign labor in particular in fields of sensitive technology for national security reasons.\n       There is a terrible trend occurring. To illustrate, three Michigan Universities alone (U of M, MSU and Wayne State) provided close to a billion dollars in aid, tuition and teaching assistantships to foreign students in 2011. US and Permanent Resident students attend undergraduate classes and pay tuition that is then often redistributed to foreign grad students who have no student debt in the form of free tuition or teaching assistantships or other support. Only a small body of US citizen and permanent resident students graduate debt free and have the means to continue to grad school. There then exists a gap for which employers look to foreign labor to fill. \nInstead of helping the problem, the proposed rule will only make this cycle worse and hurt US Citizen and Permanent Resident students. The proposed rule will increase the number of foreign students applying to the universities (as appears to be one of the stated goals of the proposal), with the ultimate goal to obtain a job in the US. However, in consequence US Citizen and Permanent Resident students will be forced to attend lesser schools due to availability and competition, and face greater competition for work when they do graduate.\n        Any proposed rule should not be at the expense of those who are citizens and permanent residents. Twelve months of OPT for all foreign university students in the spirit of international exchange is a reasonable compromise to allow training that might be unavailable in the home country.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2597", "postedDate": "2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am very glad if STEM OPT period raises to 36 months instead of 24 months.

So it is understandable that some US people would against this proposal to avoid competition.  Actually, I also believe a proposal like \"New York job only for New Yorker\", though absurd,  would gain a lot of support from New York people, especially for the immature and less educated job seeker, for the same reason.\n\nHowever, if we view the problem from a broader angle, i.e. not just from emotional or personal interests, clearly the problem would show an entirely different situation.\n\nI strongly support this proposal for the following three reasons.\n\n(1): The OPT program is one of the key factor to the technology leadership of US.\nThe big reason that US can be the leader in global technology in past century is that it can attract the talented people all over the world. Losing the legal right for foreign student to work would no doubt have extremely negative impact on this.  And without such attraction to the talented people, it is just a matter of time that US would lose the current leadership in technology. \n\n(2): The OPT program provides countless economic contribution in many aspects\n \nThe OPT program greatly helped the US education industry and all its related industries in the past 10 years, and provide countless job opportunities for US citizens, including the teaching, house renting, transportation.  Without polices like OPT-extensions, countless US citizens would lost their job and have to suffer from lower income. I actually wonder what do the protectionist really cares? The right of the US citizen, or just their own interests.\n\n(3): The OPT program actually increase the average income, not decrease.\n\nOne common assumptions of protectionist is that if the proposal passes, the high-tech companies would only hire the foreigners. Such assumption itself indicates that even the protectionists agree that the foreigners are better suit for the high-tech companies. Is such preference of big companies from the lower salary of the foreign employees? Are the salary of the foreign employees lower than the US citizens in any of the company? Clearly not. Actually, on the contrary, because of the hard working and creativity of foreign employees, the value of the job keeps increasing, and lead to the higher average salary. Take computer science positions, which usually has larger potion of foreign employs, as example. The salary of programming position keeps growing in the past ten years, not decreasing\n\nAnother counter example could be the manufacture industry, where the number of OPT student is relatively lower.  Did the big manufacture companies choose to hire more US citizens? No they didnt, they choose to directly move the industry into countries like China and Brazil, leaving the poor workers unemployed. It is easy to imagine the same situation to other industries. \n\nFinally, lets do some reverse thinking. Which country would be happiest if this proposal failed to pass? May be it is US because it satisfied some protectionist.  But clearly the China and India government would be happier because such failure would force countless high-tech personal or expert to return, which fundamentally solves the talent-loss situation in both China and India. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhuo Chen, New York University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15929", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposed rule.

This is totally wrong because we all know that there is always a gap\nbetween the knowledge on books and the practical applications. Letting students\nto practice can let them better utilize the knowledge from school.\n\n3.

This spirit is greatly encouraging and is one of the reasons why United States is so strong. Uphold this spirit and let it shine over the path of United States. \n\nThirdly, I really do not think STEM extension is going to affect the job opportunities available to US citizens. Job opportunities are available to everybody, everyone can apply to a job posting, if you are a citizen, sure you can apply to it, not to mention that citizens know a lot more opportunities than international guys. If a company is equal opportunity, it will always give you the offer if you match, or not give you the offer if somebody else has an edge over you, that has nothing to do with the STEM policy.

Weve paid our taxes, worked hard to contribute to society and have invested much into living here as good citizens. Over the years Ive held different visas, first as a dependent and later as an independent holding my own F-1 visa. The US is my home and where I was raised but now my entire world is in jeopardy because STEM OPT may or may not exist in the next few months. If you dont approve this rule, I, an American in spirit, would have to leave my home. \n\nIm the eldest of my family and serve as integral support and principal earner. If I were to leave, my family would be left in crisis. I have a brother in med school, a mortgage to pay, and two car payments. The loss of my income would be crippling. \n\nNow, you may not care for one random contributing member of your society but I represent thousands in the same position. So many would suffer. Large companies or small and too many individuals to count. Major companies would have to retrain thousands at the cost of possibly millions. Smaller companies (such as mine) would lose valuable members that contribute and push small businesses forward. You would cut off those who willingly and eagerly contribute to the life blood of the American dream. This rule carries economic significance for the immigrant and nonimmigrant alike. \n\nAmerica is a land of immigrants, you know that. Talented individuals come here from other countries and contribute directly to this society. Why brain drain that talent out? Why not keep the US competitive for longer? The economy needs a strong and intelligent workforce. \n\nNow, with regards to the rule itself and its content, I see many aspects that will burden both international students and the government itself. On the one hand the DHS is doing right by those concerned about American jobs but they may not be doing right by themselves. Providing mentorship programs is a good idea on paper but who on earth is going to process them all? And wont adding something else to approve delay STEM OPT approvals even more? Ive waited nearly 3 months for my own already and adding a mentorship program to that would only increase wait times. Delays are to be expected but grace periods and additional cap-gap policies would need to be written to accommodate for the new requirements. Would people need to apply 6 months ahead of time instead of 3? What happens to those within their 60 day grace periods before OPT begins? \n\nWith regards to the expansion of the extension to 24 months, I approve. It is a more reasonable number and allows a student to contribute to a company for a less arbitrary amount of time. An employer knows that their qualified and eligible employee will be available for a full 2 years after initial OPT. My current pending application will likely be processed as a 17 month extension but I appreciate that I can apply for the remaining available months. My only concern is how much it will cost to apply. The $380 (along with university fees) are a heavy burden and it would be unreasonable to make those who dont get the 24 month extension first pay a high amount for something that was out of their control. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tawfiq Bhuiyan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1411", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally support the proposed rule. Here is my comment on this issue based on my own experience.\n\nI received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from a Top 10 U.S. university. During my 5 years at graduate school, I received full scholarship (tuition waiver + monthly salary) which is about $400k in total and is funded completely by U.S. taxpayers (my university is a public university, and my research project was funded by U.S. Army). \n\nIf there is no OPT STEM extension available for me, under the current regulation, I have only 12 months of OPT. This is enough for doing the H1B lottery once, which has a ~50% chance of being approved. If I am not lucky enough to get the H1B work visa, I need to leave U.S. immediately after my 12-month OPT.\n\nThis means U.S. taxpayers spent $400k on training me and have a ~50% chance of losing me to a foreign country in 12 months. This means my employer, a top high-tech U.S. company has ~50% chance of losing a good employee after 12 months. I think this is a bad deal for U.S.\n\nAnd I am by no means competing with U.S. citizens for job opportunity. In my industry, there is a significant shortage of advanced degree workers. And there are simply not enough students majoring in this area (let alone enough U.S. citizens).\n\nIn the proposed rule, this won't be an issue since an F1 student with advanced degree in STEM will have at least 3 tries for H1B lottery. At ~50% approval rate, 3-4 tries result in only ~10% chance of not getting a H1B visa. This is much better than the current rule.\n\nI sincerely hope this proposed rule can be approved to help boost the U.S. economy. In case you need further information from me, I can be reached via email.

This program has never been authorized by Congress. Currently, foreign students who have been pursuing their degree for at least 9 months can work in the U.S. for 12 months, or 29 months if pursuing a STEM degree. That is above and beyond what any students or citizens of countries outside of the U.S.A. deserve, or should expect from the U.S.A.!  The new rule would extend the program's length to 36 months for these STEM students. That would decrease the opportunities for the legal citizens of the U.S.A., both student and nonstudent, to be employed.  The program motivates U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay the minimum wage or their share of the payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year, and costing a high amount of expenses from the legal U.S. citizens and employees and workers, to benefit the laziness of immigrants..\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time of an H-1B visathere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"  \nIt is quite apparent, and as clear as the blue sky on a sunny, cloudless day, that it is a path towards sacrificing all that the legal U.S. citizens have worked so hard to earn, to spoil the undeserving citizens of other countries who are already getting more from the U.S.A. than they deserve.\n...expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT)through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visasbut do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\nThis whole thing proposed  by the politicians, who may I remind you, pay no taxes, is in opposition to the heart and foundation of the U.S.A.\n1.The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students TO 36 MONTHS, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa AND EVENTUAL GREEN CARD. This is a DIRECT VIOLATION of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. IT'S HARD ENOUGH ALREADY FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, especially recent U.S. graduates, TO FIND WORK, AND THIS RULE WOULD MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BY ADDING UNNECESSARY JOB COMPETITION TO THE MIX.\n2.The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n3.The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n4.I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge that accompanied their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. This is not good to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Randall Kennedy", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8092", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Employment opportunity lets students know the advanced research or the work environment in the country differing to their home country letting new horizons open .", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Narendra  Achanta", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20196", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Several dacades ago, Albert Eintein - a great scientist and a humanist - said America was the hope of all the honorable men pursuing freedom and justice.

Frankly speaking, for those full-time employees in such companies, I highly doubt if failure on this proposal will actually kick them out of American job market. Maybe some of them will just be transferred to another location for one or two years then come back to the U.S. with another status instead of H1B; and for the potential full-times, e.g. interns, contractors, most of them are ideal candidates who these companies paid a lot of time and money to help them grow in an internal environment, thus it will be a great loss to the companies if they cannot keep these people just for their working status.\n\n3) About the worry on minimal wage, I did some research and it basically has nothing to do with us. I believe the average salary of F1 students with STEM degrees are way beyond the minimum. In a word, international students are by no means cheap labor, they invested a huge amount to get the top notch education in the world and they deserve the legal right to work here for a longer term, and it's unreasonable to force them to leave this country right after their graduation: in that case, failure on this proposal will not only harm the profit of most of the high-tech companies, it will cause the loss of incoming international students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Junyu Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14883", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is very important that US, as an immigrant country, that welcomes high-educated workforce.\n36-month OPT is really good, positive. \nI strongly agree with extending the OPT.\nStrongly support! strongly recommend!

However, each international student has to adapt to a totally unknown environment after they step out of the airplane. They also have to face the issues such as language, communication with native people and unfamiliarity with laws and rules. Many foreign STEM workers have to re-learn the technical knowledge in another language, which may have been spoken by native speakers for 20 years and by foreigners for 2 years. You can imagine when a technical lead of a company is interviewing a foreign student and a native guy with same education level and technical skills, which one will be preferred? \n\nIn the interviews of the companies like Facebook or Microsoft, foreign and native candidates will face different challenges. People with permanent residency or citizenship may only be asked questions about concepts like what recursion is, while foreign job seekers have to attend interviews one after another and solve complex data structure and algorithm problems. Some companies even tell their recruiting standard clearly- we only consider green card holders and doctor students. I still havent figured out the association between doctor degree and green card, but it is obviously more difficult for foreigners to get jobs than citizens. It is impossible for US citizens to get their job positions robbed by international students and the worry about US citizen losing jobs due to OPT extension is unfounded.\n\nForcing international students to leave US is not a good way to reduce the pressure which native job seekers are suffering from, because foreigner usually get less payment in their own countries than that they can get in America. One programmer in China can be paid ten thousand Yuan monthly, equal to about 1666 dollars each monthly before paying tax (I dont know whether Mr. Donald Trump has mentioned it or not). This salary can hardly be accepted by technical workers in US since many things are also sold at a higher price than that of China. If those international students leave US and work in their own countries, companies in US will outsource more projects to pay less and US workers will therefore face greater challenge.\n\nIntuitively, cancellation of OPT extension is what American STEM people want but actually not. In addition, universities and colleges are recruiting more international students and charging a large amount of tuition and other fees, which is an important source of scholarship for US students. Many international students choose to study in US because US provides work authorization for them to practice their skills after undergraduate or graduate education. After cancellation of OPT extension, the potential international students will turn to the other countries. Many US students will lose the chance to study in colleges or universities unless their family is able to pay twenty or thirty thousand dollars each year.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yunlong  Gao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18369", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.

In my opinion, the government should make use of those cheaper labors with fresh edge knowledge before they leave U.S.. What's more, small business is the sinew of the economy. The foreign minorities usually are willing to do part-time volunteer job in the small company. This kind of high-educated free labor provides the timely help to the small businesses which have great ideas but are struggling with the profit-expense balance problem. The economy is complicated, like the minimum salary can increase the employee income but will decrease the job opportunities and increase the unemployment, and finally the existing employees will have to overload, what's worse, the soar unemployment causes the social problems. We should confess that the avoid of OPT extension also has much more harmful effect.\n\nSomeone may argue that the foreign students would threaten the local employment, however they jump to the conclusion because they are not familiar with the OPT extension regulation which is not H1B at all. The foreign students should leave U.S., if the OPT expires and they cannot find the company help them apply H1B visa. In addition, with the same competence, for a long-term position, a company will hire an American student or a foreign student? Definitely American student? Why? Because hiring a foreign student costs more such as H1B application, green card application and the risk of rehiring if any application process fails.

Many people who achieved great success and made great contributions to America are international students from other countries. For example, in Silicon Valley, there are about 33.2% companies are run by Indians who got their science or engineering degrees in America. And we know Silicon Valley is a powerful engine of innovative IT techniques of America. Because of it, America's technology in computer, IC and many other fields is much more advanced than other countries in the world. Therefore, to give more work and practice chances to international students will keep America more advanced than other countries in the world.\n\n2. More training opportunities will attract more excellent and intelligent young people to America. Different from some countries in Europe which even do not provide work or training opportunities for foreigners, America is famous of its opening and generosity to people from all over the world. In China, a survey shows that in the year 2015, more than 75% high school students prefer to study in America if they have the chance to study aboard. And among the students who graduated from science and engineering majors of the Top 10's universities in China in 2015, about 40% of them will study aboard, and within these students, 92% are pursuing or have already got offers from American universities. So more genius young people are hoping to come to America, and the government should give more chances to them. They will make great contribution to the nation.\n\n3. An extended training period will not influence American citizens' rights and benefit. Surely, more job seekers will bring about more competition, but American citizens actually can get more benefits than do by international students in school. For instance, many scholarships in universities are limited to US citizens. And American students and international students are receiving the same education in the university. So American students should have more advantages when they are seeking jobs.\n\n4. A longer training period is good for the small business in America. American government leaders are encouraging the development of small business. Small companies or business require graduates of different backgrounds. And small business or companies usually require 3-4 years to become stable. A longer training period will allow them to hire more talent students and develop in a better way.\n\nBased on the above reason, I believe the government's proposal is a good decision which will bring about more benefits to the nation and its people.       \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by He Hu, Texas A&M University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11229", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Great rule for economy.

It's win-win for all parties.\n\nInternational students come to US to get advanced educations. They pay the tuition. They live there and stimulate the local economy. For example, all the international students will need a bank account, a cellphone, a computer and a car maybe. With increased amount of the international students coming to US, all the related industry will prosper. \n\nInternational students bring fresh air/ideas to colleges. They study hard to earn a degree and then they try to find a job to apply what they have learned into practice. US becomes so powerful today is because all the people having dreams with knowledge and passion are attracted here to build their own land. The people originate from different part of the world settle down here and utilize their intelligence to excel in different fields. If you are not giving enough opportunities to these talent people, how can you expect US to become more powerful and advanced in the future ?\n\nI saw some of the comments mentioning F1 students took US workers job.  Its not true.  As you know, in order to recruit a F1 students to work, the company has to follow some complex procedures. But why the company would bother to get a international student ?  There are two reasons.  1. There are not enough US workers in STEM field. If you check the most interested majors in college, fewer STEM fields are among the top ten list.  2. US workers are not qualified for some STEM jobs. Rather than blocking the international workers, the education or training system should be reformed to improve the employability of US STEM workers. Labor market is a free market, if you manually set some strict rules, it may solve the problem temporarily but larger problem will be seen later on. US workers need to be aware of this issue and can not just avoid competition in labor market by relaying on the unfair rules or regulations.\n\nAs I said previously, people from different countries come to US for study. The OPT and STEM extension is just the first part to filter the international students. Those with advanced knowledge and skills will stay to work. Then if they survive from this process and satisfy with the working and living environment. Most of the international workers will apply H1-B and then later on to become a permanent residence or US citizen. Only a small amount of international people will survive from this process. There are immigration systems to regulate this part. Although, it also need to be reformed. Overall, its a dynamic process. International students have to experience F1, OPT, OPT extension, H1-B and permanent residence to become a US citizen.  Its long and tedious process that will filter most of the international people.\n\nWith all the above being said, it is very important to reform the rules and offer opportunities to the F1 students.

Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. And those tech companies is risking potential loss of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles?\n\nIf those people really need something to worry about, this is what they are supposed to worry about: why not spending more time improving their own skills set those companies are looking for instead of wasting time leaving negative comments here?

People on F-1 visas or others who have no legal or moral right to influence your decision on this matter. The only opinions you should consider are those of Americans.\n\n- A person with a Bachelors degree, or higher, does not NEED training! They've had their training already, and only need to adapt themselves to the work environment of the company that hires them. An F-1 student should be encouraged to leave the country upon graduation while their skills are still fresh and they can do the most good for their home country.\n\n- American STEM graduates can't find jobs in STEM fields. Why? Because companies do not have to pay SocSec and Medicare taxes for OPT employees. This translates to a defacto subsidy for employers who hire OPT workers. Thus, it is easier for an OPT student to find a job in his or her chosen field than it is for a native born American.\n\n- There is no shortage of STEM workers in America. My husband has been involved in IT since the 80's and I can state that there never was a shortage. There is, in fact, a surplus of qualified Americans who are willing and able to do these jobs. If there was a true shortage, wages would be rising in the STEM fields at a rate higher than that found in other fields. That simply is not happening. Why? Because the government has made it easy for companies to bring in foreign workers at a lower cost. It has also allowed companies to hire fresh employees with the latest skills rather than train existing employees. If you are of the opinion that older STEM workers just can't learn the new technologies, I ask you to look at the ages of those who actually 'developed' these new technologies. You will find that many were over 40.\n\n- Lastly, STEM workers have a double job. We have to be effective with current technology while also devoting time and resources to learning new technologies. The good thing is that most of us enjoy doing just that. Once a gearhead, always a gearhead. The OPT program, by flooding the job market with cheap employees, makes it more difficult for American STEM workers at all levels to maintain employment.

Unfortunately, many people of this generation have forgotten, what made this country it is today: people, including your parents, grandparents, and millions of hardworking immigrants and non-immigrants, same as them. \n\nImmigrants and non-immigrants (people have legal status but not citizenship) have built this great country and kept it strong, robust for over two centuries. Among these people, international students (F1 visa holders) is a special group. They are young, enthusiastic, well educated (many of them have advanced degree, published research achievements), and motivated to contribute their knowledge and devote their energy to the United States. All they want for return is simple and harmless: some of them want to gain industry experience before they go home; some of them want to work on the best projects, with the most talented colleagues to push the world to a next level; some of them just want to start an entire new life at this beautiful place and become a citizen in the future. The most important thing is: they contribute, they earn it. \n\nOPT extension is one of the best paths for F1 students to start their careers, to help you and us to keep America the number one country worldwide. They pay the same (or even higher) tuitions, they do the same homework, they complete the same required credits, they make friends and study together with your sons and daughters. Why don't they deserve the same right of employment? They work, they pay taxes and social security, they spend their salaries in the US, to stimulate the economy grows. They are friendly, they don't commit crimes, they bring multi-culture to your home, to make it much more wonderful. All they need is simple: a chance to be hired, to feed their family, just as you already own. \n\nMany people who object this rule claim that F1 students will steal their jobs. The concern is understandable, however, it is not necessary. Because these young men they don't steal, their well education background (which is received in the US) only taught them to earn. As the fact is, Americans are and still will be the majorities in almost all companies (except those foreign owned ones) in the US. Capability is still the No.1 priority for company to hire a candidate. F1 students are taking the little position share that can be easily ignored (but not their contributions). If an American sadly lost his/her job, it's simple for him/her to blame F1 students so it won't make him/her look too bad, only because F1 students are weaker targets in this country. Did these Americans ask themselves: Why is it you that lose the job, while there are billions of Americans still have theirs? Your so called \"competitors\" are yourselves, not F1 students.\n\n\"American is a free country\", this is a phrase we often hear from Americans. People believe it, and believe this country respects human rights better than others. This is one of the many reasons why immigrants and non-immigrants came here at first. Employment is a basic human right, which should not be taken from a fresh out of college, well educated, international student.\n\nAs a member of graduated F1 student, who is currently benefiting from OPT, I strongly support this rule, as it is positive to both hardworking Americans and us.

In the long run, the high-tech is a critical point to stimulate the economic growth.

Now many other countries have pushed out new acts or regulations to attract more foreign students to their countries for education. If the U.S. doesnt provide better acts or regulations for foreign students, it would lose more and more top foreign talents. So, why is this important? Because foreign students can contribute significantly to the U.S. economy. Firstly, foreign students bring about significant amount of educational investments, and a lot of bright minds to the U.S. This actually helps a lot of U.S. colleges to improve their quality of education. Secondly, newly graduated foreign students, especially those in STEM OPT, can bring new blood to high-tech companies, which is essential for these companies, as there are usually more positions than available talents for them. Thirdly, foreign students can help improve local economy of where theyre living or studying. For example, in Pittsburgh, you can always see a lot of foreign students in restaurants, cinemas, supermarkets, shopping malls, etc. They actually help improve the economy, and provide new jobs for local people.\n\n2. The STEM OPT extension is only for QUALIFIED foreign students, and it won't take americans' jobs away (as stated in a bunch of negative comments). I saw some negative comments saying that the government shouldn't extend OPT for \"illegals\", or simply \"foreigners\". But the thing is that, students that are qualified for STEM OPT extension have legal visa at the U.S., so they are not \"illegals\". Meanwhile, they must work in STEM industries in E-Verify companies, which require adequate supervision and examination from U.S. government, and only a part of foreign students have this qualification. Thus, students that are qualified for STEM OPT extension are not simply \"foreigners. They are highly-skilled talents that can contribute to industries.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhengyang Zuo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18532", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the improving and expanding OPT for F-1 students with STEM degree!!\n\nOPT is a great opportunity for not only international student to work in the US after graduation but also the US government and the US citizen. I am surprised that some US-born Americans are against this rule. Many of the people who against this rule are not clear about what they are talking about. Some of the comments here are completely out of logic. I would like to argue them one by one:\n\n1). Some people claim that international employees don't pay for their taxes. WRONG!! According to the regulations from the IRS, international employees are paying the same amount of taxes as native. However, they don't benefit as much as the US citizens. For example, a lot of international employees pay social security taxes (SST) during their stay in the US, but a lot of them leave the country after working here for a few years. And they won't be able to get refund on this portion of taxes even if they will not be benefited from SST they pay after they retire.\n\n2). Some people claim that international employees will be a threat to the US citizens in job market. WRONG!! To work in the US, there are a lot of restriction for non-US citizens. It is true that in some fields such as IT and engineering, a lot of employees are foreigners. However, the reason of this is because a lot of the US citizens are not willing to study science and engineering. The IT companies are expanding so quickly these years so that only hiring the US citizens cannot fulfill the companies' expanding requirement. Fresh graduate international students take these positions and make their contribution to the development of the IT and engineering industry of the US. With the restriction of OPT, it is extremely difficult for these students to enter other industry if they are not in the related major. \n\n3). some people claim that international students take salary lower than the minimum wage to compete with US citizens unequally. WRONG!! For most international students, they work with LEGAL companies and pay their taxes. Their salary are definitely higher than the minimum wage. The situation of taking salary lower than minimum wage only applies to ILLEGAL immigrants. For illegal immigrants, they don't even have a chance to apply for OPT let alone use STEM extension. Please don't confound OPT with illegal working in the US.\n\nNow I would like to state why STEM program is necessary not only to the international students but also to the US government and the US citizens:\n\n1). STEM program provide a fairly long time (29 to 36 months) for international students to apply for H1B visa, therefore saves companies money in recruiting new people. If there is no extension on the program, employees who didnt get H1B visa will have to leave the country after 12 months employment. This will be a big loss for companies who hire and train them. \n\n2). As mentioned above, STEM program only applies to students who majored in science and engineering. The reason to have this program is help fill the vacancies in related industry in the US, since there are not enough native students majored in related fields. Thus, extending the practice time for international students in these fields will benefits all these high-yield tech companies in the US. Otherwise, where can you find such a huge number of intelligent, industrial and hard-working employees? \n\n3). The extension of STEM program will make studying in the US more attractive. Currently the US is still the country has the most international students in the world. Usually, international students benefits more on educational revenue since they pay more on their tuition fees. Having more international students studying in the US will also be an incentive for traveling market, since their parents and friends are more willing to come to the US to visit them.\n\nBased on my statement, I believe the extension of STEM program is necessary and will be beneficial to the US government and US citizens. Arresting this rule is shortsighted and will be a big mistake, which will cost the US government millions of dollars. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chang Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15121", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Diversity is important.

It can benefit Americans. \n\nFirst, the OPT STEM rule can attract more international students to come to study in the US, and the high tuition and fee will enhance American economics. The total international student enrollment in the US is 886,052 in the school year 2013-14 based on http://www.iie.org/Services/Project-Atlas/United-States/International-Students-In-US. Each students tuition and fee are around $40,000 per year. The total tuition fee for international students per year is around $35,000,000,000. If we abolished the OPT STEM rule, there would be less international students coming to the US for study because the tuition and fee are very high and they dont have enough chances to work in the US to apply what they learn from school and get back their tuition and fee from work. In this case, US would lose that 35 billion dollars, which is a big drop in education. People may doubt that international students will all get their tuition and fee back by working, and that will do no good to USs benefit. However, that is not true in reality because only a small amount of international students can get a job after school in the US, so overall America still gets the profit. Thus, its very necessary to keep the OPT STEM rule to have US economics keep increasing. \n\nSecond, high technologies in science and engineering are partially supported by international students and employees. There are a number of international employees in IT companies. They are doing a non-substitutive role in IT industry. Abolishing the OPT STEM rule and letting them leave the US will be a disaster for American IT industry. In addition, there are quite a few of international researchers in different areas of research institutes and universities. They are doing a great contribution to academic research. Keeping the 24-month OPT STEM will encourage more people to come to join research work in the US. The advanced scientific research can somehow improve human beings life, and the US will always be the very first country to gain these scientific results. From the aspect of keeping the US as the top country to master the advanced technology, the OPT STEM rule should be kept. \n\nThird, the OPT STEM rule can help increase the US employees working skill and improve the industry production quality by making a more competitive job market from international employees. The US companies have more good candidates to hire as their employees, meaning that the quality of industry product is increasing. Basically, American companies and universities are attracting the most excellent students and employees from the world to come to work in the US through the OPT STEM rule. The OPT STEM rule will make US citizens life into a higher standard. \n\nTo conclude, the OPT STEM rule should pass. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhihao Xie", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17805", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Expansion of the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program is rather short-sighted in that the American employers and foreign workers are exempt from payroll taxes.

For example, footnote (24) refers to \"Foreign STEM Workers and Native Wages and Employment in U.S. Cities\" by Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, Chad Sparber.  An updated version of this paper was released on July 1st and an analysis of it at http://econdataus.com/jole_pss.htm shows some serious problems.\n\nIn addition, a search of the comments for the number 2.62 or 262 show at least six references to another flawed study that is often quoted by proponents of OPT expansion.  One of them is labeled \"Mass Mail Campaign 22\" and contains the following statement:\n\n\"A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development.\"\n\nGoogling this sentence shows that it's source appears to be a sample letter posted by an immigration lawyer at http://immigrationgirl.com/f-1-students-tell-dhs-to-fix-the-2008-opt-stem-extension-rule-sample-email-here/ .  Interestingly, it appears that this sentence was taken verbatim from a 2013 article at http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/articles/26825/raising-cap-need-increased-numbers-h-1b-visas-skilled-workers .  In any case, an analysis at http://econdataus.com/amerjobs.htm shows that the 2.62 number is deeply flawed. It is the result of a study of the years 2000-2007.  If you use the exact same formulas but move the time span forward two years, to 2002 to 2009, the association becomes a LOSS of 1.21 jobs.  This strongly suggests that the positive association is caused by the inclusion of the tech crash and the steep job losses of both foreign and native workers in 2000 and 2001.  You see, a strong job LOSS in both groups is mathematically identical to a strong job GAIN of both groups, at least as far as the linear regression that determines the job change is concerned.  If the study's interest is the effect of an increase in foreign STEM workers, 2002 to 2009 is a much more appropriate period and this period is associated with a job LOSS.\n\nAll of this shows that you need to check that studies that you or your readers reference have been replicated and validated.  The fact that an economist has put their name on it is meaningless unless the study has been reviewed and validated, preferably by researchers on all sides of the issue.  In my view, the most credible evidence suggests that current policies lower wages and job opportunities for native workers.  For this reason, I am very much against the STEM OPT extension.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by R.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers.

STEM caught on, students rose to the occasion, parents and the broader community saw the value of the endeavor--that is until reports filtered back that recent;y graduating students couldn't get jobs using their STEM educations. That takes the incentive out of any project when a community invested in STEM learns that there are no, or not that many, jobs in STEM for all the students we are training and setting on that course.\n\nAs an educator with 50+ years experience at retirement, I see the STEM education initiative in K-12 schools, technical school and community colleges has gone the way of other initiatives I've watched and been apart of for the past five decades as an educator: first there's the hype, then the buy-in (coerced or otherwise), then the glut of students trained and pointed in that initiatives direction, then the market flooding, and finally the let down when graduating students can't find jobs in which to use that training. \n\nWhen we seek to prioritize a training, nationally, then we should support the job market, nationally, for those American students we've trained. Not to do so demoralizes, at the least, those whose focus has been turned to prepare themselves for that opportunity--including all stakeholders: students, teachers, parents, and often the wider community--who equally give themselves to the initiative's promise and potential.\n\nAs I see it, and historically, it has been a priority to educate American students for American jobs first and foremost. Please do not think here that I am pass in not recognizing the encroaching globalism, I  see it--but I think it should unfold organically, not by neglecting the people of this country and their needs in lieu of forcing its evolution: America's first responsibility should be to provide for its own citizens--and I think we have not done that by a long shot! That said, to my mind, this \"Proposed Rule\"would be an example of disregarding that foremost responsibility: Once our own citizens have their education and career needs met, as in preparing and obtaining jobs using their fanfare induced STEM training. Then and only then, if our largess is such that we can afford to extend services to students of other countries who come here for our superior education, who then opt to linger to take advantage of extended time to use that education in our marketplace, that could be an option, but only after our marketplace is saturated with American workers trained for those positions. \n\nThe example of companies such as Disney, although using a different government rule, to replace American worker's with foreign workers is just a prelude to what your Proposed Rule will do. It is at this point in time a further demoralization, destruction, and I make bold to add, demonization, of the American worker in the American workplace.

Nothing!\n\nIf anyone wants the tech companies to hire more Americans, propose an educational reform! The average US STEM education before college (or including college, arguably) just SUCKS! That's why the US cannot produce enough American engineers to power the creativity we display for now. US tech companies need to hire brilliant international STEM talents to keep them on the lead.\n\nSo, STOP ascribing a problem to a WRONG group of people!

By extending the STEM OPT, there's a moderately higher chance for F-1 students to get H1B, and most of the F-1 students with H1B will stay at the same company to keep their H1B valid. Therefore it's good for the companies hiring F-1 students because it's more possible for them to keep experienced and qualified employees, and the profit of the companies may increase, which will eventually turn into benefit for all employees in the company or higher revenue which benefits the whole state/nation. \n\n2. To be honest, plenty of companies especially those big companies with good benefits are not providing sponsorship for international students (it might be a different case for the IT industry, but that's also because the industry is still booming and requiring plenty of employees, as well as the ratio of native students in computer science related subjects are relatively lower), so lots of international students are working in small and medium scale companies, doing the job that may not seem very appealing, while not many native students are willing to pursue these kind of jobs. Thus extension of OPT won't lower the chance for native students to get a decent job. \n\n3. The extension of OPT would attract more international students to study in the United States, and this is actually a considerable income for not only the universities, but also house rental, cars dealership as well as food industry. \n\nThese are my reasons for supporting the rule, it's a little bit lengthy but I hope that people can read it patience and think about it objectively.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nAs a STEM student working in a technology company I believe the proposed rule would be a great benefit both to the students and the American economy because:\n\n1.\tMy employer spends on an average about $40000 to $60000 (travel expenses, hotel stay, salaries for recruiters, etc) in hiring one engineer.  I have seen tens of people interviewed before one is selected. When I went through the interview process, I was not asked about my immigration status till I had an offer. All they asked initially was whether I can legally work in the United States. Now that I am working, I am paid the same as my American colleagues. This is not an isolated incident in the technology industry. Several companies go through this hoop before finding the right person for the job. More often than not, the right person turns up to be in another country. With respect to that, I suspect there is no shortage of jobs but definitely a shortage of labor. If more STEM students get to work in the USA before heading back home, it will not only benefit the student but the companies and in general the economy as well.\n\n2.\tThe second reason I think the US needs more STEM students is the opportunity of ancillary jobs created due to the nature of high-tech work done by STEM graduates. To cite an example, I have seen engineering teams of 5 have ancillary support teams of at least 8. Thus, an engineer, could create on an average 1.6 jobs without moving a muscle. This of course does not include the possibility of jobs that could have been created by graduates who want to open their own companies. For instance, consider Flipkart and Snapdeal. Flipkart is currently valued at $1 billion and Snapdeal at $100 million. Both of their founders are US educated but couldn't implement their business ideas here and thus went back to India.\n\n3.\tMy third point of discussion is the time a student should be allowed to work in the US. I am from the technology sector so I will stick to what experience has taught me. In the words of a Principal Engineer I know, a new hire usually takes a year to learn the system, another year to implement and another year to teach before she/he could move on. What he meant, I believe, is that computer systems in the real world is much more complicated that what is there in theory. It is not unnatural even for very smart people to take a copious amount of time to learn what her/his work involves. To understand the implications and complications. And I believe without understanding how theory relates to the real world, no education is complete. Thus, 24 months of STEM in addition to 12 months of OPT is perfect for a student willing to learn the complexities and nuances of a computer system in the real world. \n\n\nSincerely,\nAbhishek Dey Das", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Abhishek Dey Das", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9949", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Dear officers,\n\nI am an international student graduated from University of Florida in 2014 and pursued a STEM degree.

For example, many research projects in the field of Biology usually last at least 2 years. This extension in the proposal will enable students to be able to focus on the project for around 2 years without worrying about their visa status, during when their methodology become matured and improved for future work. In addition, currently, the admission of many PhD programs especially in the field of STEM require at least 2 year working experience. It is, unfortunately, very challenging and somewhat unfair for international students to apply for a PhD degree, especially in their second year of OPT. To be specific, if a student does not get accepted into the PhD program in the upcoming year, of which they will probably find out by the middle of April upcoming year by latest, they will have to find an alternative to support their visa status within only a few months before their OPT ends; otherwise, they will have to get back to their home countries. Therefore, most international students will not take this risk to apply at their second year of OPT, which constrains and limits their further graduate studies application choices.

Because of the status/visa issue, the foreign graduates must take further steps of harding working and show higher expertise to get employed. Relatively lower cost and higher productivity with better quality, American tect companies who hire those graduates student get significant enhancement of their competitiveness. Without it, these companies would loss their advantages, and therefore are very likely be defeated or even bought by other foreign companies. Because without the OPT opportunities, those valuable graduates will join in the foreign competitors of these American tect companies. To my knowledge, in my companies and many similar American companies in the oil and gas industry, the administration staff, managers, directors, are almost all Americans. They did not study STEM; they studies business, management, law, etc. They are in charge of the companies. In the case losing competitiveness and shutting down of the companies, everybody will lose job, including the American administrators and managers.\n\nSecond, American students definitely have, and actually better, opportunities to study STEM fields and find relevant jobs. My five years experience of studying in U.S. witnesses the reason why American student do not study STEM fields. Because they think STEM fields are harder, and more importantly, they make less money. For example, average starting salary for law graduates is $160,000 versus $80,000 for physics PhD (www.forbes.com). My officemate as a PhD graduate is a white American who really loves geophysics, working hard and performing greatly. He receives multiple offers before graduation. Actually, three American students out of my ten classmates are the first three graduates receiving offers, and multiple ones.\n\nThird, the OPT program improves the positive business culture in U.S. As a STEM graduate, I work hard to create values to my company. I pay all required taxes to support the government and society. I believe a fair and justic society should provide a platform and climate to encourage job seeker's competition by real skills, expertise, and capability, only in which way the quality of products can be improved and power of free market can play. It should not rule out talents and competitive hard-workers by nationality or visa status, which obviously will encourage laziness of the native graduates, deteriorating the spirit of freedom and everybody's right of pursuing happiness.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yanjun Hao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16215", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree with the extension on OPT for F-1 students in STEM majors.

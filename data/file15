Most academic projects require at least two to three years to get the first phase done. In industry, the tech companies usually spend significant amount of time and cost hunting for the right talents. Opt extension can help those companies avoid the huge loss of qualified talents. To some folks' point, opt students will harm the opportunities of the locals, i don't think this is the case. First of all, opt is a practical training, just like most internship, it is common to have a compensation lower than full time job. And there is detailed requirements about hiring oversea students, almost all companies would rather choose a local student if he or she has the same qualification as an opt student. In such case, there is no way an opt student can cause any harm to a local student. And cancellation of opt extension will not do any favor for the local student while causing a lot of troubles for the tech employers.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yichen Jin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12493", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the opt-extension and I think it would be in the best interest of our nation.\n\nIf there is no opt-extension, many overseas students won't come to U.S. to study because there is no longer good opportunity for them to get work experience in the U.S., they may select U.K. or Australia as their target country for studying abroad, which may be a disaster for the higher educational system in the U.S.. \n\nIf you have been to any neighborhood near colleges, you probably noticed that many of the student there are international students, they are the source income of the local restaurants, pharmacy shop and grocery stores.

First, the extension does create more job opportunities for international students, while at the same time it will not harm the US citizens by decreasing their chances of getting a job. The reason is that there are still a large number of companies will hire citizens only and not sponsor H1B, which is already unfair for international students with the same education level. As far as I can see, none of the current citizens in our graduate program (hence have the same education background as the international students) are not able to get a job because the so called 'competition'. \n\nSecond, as I have heard a lot of projects in industrial companies last usually much longer than 12 months (e.g. clinical trails in medical device companies). Without extension, new-graduates will loss their jobs after 12 months and at the same time it costs a lot (manpower and material resources) for the company who suffers from projects transaction from one group of people to another. They need to train the new employees from the beginning and wait long enough for them to get familiar with current projects. \n\nThird, as a current student, I spend my days at school with professors with different cultures and backgrounds. 20 or 30 years ago, these respectable researchers were newly graduated students and looking for jobs in the US as a non-citizen. Look at how much contribution they have made so far, we, the current international students, would like to make the same contribution by going to either academia or industry. \n\nIn the conclusion, this extension will certainly benefit both the students and the US, including every citizen.

Although expanding the OPT period for F-1 student might seems to reduce the available for U.S. citizen, the pros of having the extension can actually have more positive effects both to ourself and to the country. First of all, I think the difficulty for university graduate to find a job is not increasing at all even though some people claims the F-1 students have occupied their positions. Further more, based on my personal experience of working with non-U.S. citizen either at school or at work, I always feel that most of them are well qualified in their professional fields and if the states did not allow them to work for the countries, I will feel really sorry for wasting their knowledge.  In a nutshell, I think the states should provided F-1 student with enough training period to see whether they can contribute to the state. If they can make real impact to their professional fields or to U.S. companies, I did not see a reason why we should deprive their right to get trained at U.S. or even work at U.S. The current CEO of google Pichai was a F-1 student once before, if he did not get the chance to work at U.S. he won't be able to make such big impact on IT field as he did today.

We don't need to bypass the fact that the U.S. might be at a great era ever since 2008, perhaps an unprecedented one in the course of reaching a peaked economy. Turning down and expelling work force with cutting edge expertise would be exceedingly disruptive both imminently and in the long run.

If one happens to stay out of a job, and happens to be an American, - before making judgment - it might be more objective for one to consider the competency between him/herself and the counterparts with more cultivated education background that the American institution has nurtured.

Most of international students especially stem major students came to US for their outstanding performance. In other words, US government educated these talents with its own funding, great education resources. Now, international students with advanced skills and knowledge want to stay and contribute to US but are not allowed. It does not make sense for US. You invest a lot of money but don't want return.\n\n2. US is the greatest country in the world. It was build up by immigrants. At the very beginning, none of them are originally from US. They were from everywhere. Diversity is the secret why US can outperform the other countries. Recall from WWIIUS diversity attracted most of scientists in the world to come and serve for US. Why are now US government going to abandon its biggest advantages rather than keeping it? Every resident of US should be proud of US diversity not shame on it. KEEP US DIVERSIFIED!\n\n3. If US government decide to let all international students get out of the states once they graduate, will US economy continue to grow and every one is happy? Definitely NOT! All positions currently filled by international students still can't find appropriate US candidates. What will companies respond in such situation? They will transfer job opportunities out where have lower salary cost and better skilled candidates. Eventually, US will lose international competition. \n\nActually, international students compete with other US residence sitting on worse situation and getting lower compensation than market level but they provide a more healthy US economy. They want to be part of the states not to combat with anybody. If US government drive them away rather than welcome them, US will lose the opportunity to win the competition in the 21st century.

If we fail to improve and ExpandTraining Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees, USA will not be as attractive as before to the international students as a country to study aboard as they no longer got enough time/opportunities to gain enough industry experience after they finish their study in US.  However, the industry experience is what most of the international care most about their studying aboard. Once USA loses its appeal among the international talents, there will be a big regression in USA's economy and technology development.

OPT extension provides great benefits to medium and small American companies.For companies who cannot afford sponsoring a person with H1B visa and needs capable employees, OPT gives them an opportunity to hire well-educated students. In many industries, there are not enough American citizens for each company. Many startup companies simply cannot find enough highly-educated American employees. This makes OPT recipients ideal candidates for these companies. \n\n2. OPT extension does not prevent qualified Americans to find a job. It is a well known fact that the tech and science industry is in need of more people. An American who did not receive the corresponding education simply cannot get the job even if no international students are hired. In fact, we rarely hear any opposition from highly educated Americans to this OPT extension policy. On the contrary, the people who oppose the OPT extension are usually people with a lower education. OPT students are not even competing with them on the same ground. As a matter of fact, OPT extension can help these low educated people in the long run through making more successful American companies. It is more about making the pie bigger, instead of dividing up a pie which does not belong to the protesters in the first place. \n\n3. OPT extension is a fair and sound policy which will attract more talented people to come to America and make America great. United States is a country founded by immigrants.

I firmly support this proposed rule, as it can create more domestic jobs, and promotes gender and race equality in STEM fields. Reason 1: It can create more domestic jobs. Without the OPT extension, F-1 students have a max of 12 months to practice their ideas, which hardly gives them time to even get a startup company over the incubation period [Reference 1, \"The Funding primer: How a start-up moves from incubation to IPO\"]. This 12-month time constraint highly discourages/forbids F-1 students from starting their own company. However with the additional 24-month extension, a total of 36 months (i.e. three years) seems to be a much feasible timeframe for the enthusiastic F-1 students (who usually start to form their ideas before graduation) to bring their startups to potentially pass the initial Series of funding, and therefore creates more domestic jobs [Reference 2, \"Supporting Small Businesses and Creating Jobs\"]. And even if they fail to bring their startups all the way to IPO, the process of starting a company already create domestic jobs, and generates revenue for other businesses (e.g. through renting office space).\nReason 2: It will help to promote gender and race equality in STEM fields. Various studies have pointed out the large gender and race gap in STEM fields [Reference 3, \"Women in STEM: A Gender Gap to Innovation\"]. In addition, multiple studies haven shown that \"A higher percentage of female and minority STEM field graduate students positively impacts on the persistence of female and minority students\" [Reference 4, \"Persistence of women and minorities in STEM field majors\"]. So to bring up the self-sustainable cycle that attracts more minority students into the STEM fields, we need the seed that can start this cycle, and F-1 students can be a good part of this seeding process with proper support (e.g. the OPT STEM extension).F-1 students are usually the minority groups in their school, so the fact that an F-1 student can get through all the difficulties in STEM major can further encourage domestic students, especially students in minority groups, to study STEM fields. \nHowever without the proposed rule to support an OPT extension, F-1 students are usually in a frustrated situation to look for job opportunities that can sponsor their work status not too long after graduation. These frustration and feeling of instability can give a false impression to others that regardless of how hard they study/work, minority students will simply keep encountering barriers, both academically and non-academically, that prevent them from succeeding in STEM fields.\nIn addition, people in minorities groups are more likely and are more effective at encouraging/mentoring people in similar situations. For example, many tech companies (e.g. Microsoft, 3M) have women mentoring program which allows women in the tech industry to better support each other [Reference 5, Microsoft Women Mentoring Program], as they tend to understand each other's situation better than men in the same industry (e.g. difficulties for working moms). So as someone in a (or more) minority group(s), F-1 students are more willing to get involved in and can effectively improve the gender and race equality in STEM fields.\n\nHowever, as it typically takes a new hire 3-6 months to adjust to a new job in STEM fields [Reference 6, How long should it take a new hire to get up to speed?], if an F-1 student has to leave after one year, it seems to be very unlikely that the student can have the opportunity to contribute to help other minorities or to volunteer locally to promote STEM fields within local communicates. However with the additional 24 months, after adjusting to his/her job, an F-1 student can have enough time to get involved with various programs to promote equality in STEM fields as theyd like to. \nReferences:\n[1]: The Funding primer: How a start-up moves from incubation to IPO \nhttp://www.livemint.com/Money/dd8K7FPx6yRzrMpMSw9JqK/The-Funding-primer-How-a-startup-moves-from-incubation-to.html\n[2]: Supporting Small Businesses and Creating Jobs \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet/supporting-small-businesses-and-creating-jobs\n[3]: Women in STEM: A Gender Gap to Innovation \nhttp://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-gender-gap-innovation\n[4]: Persistence of women and minorities in STEM field majors: Is it the school that matters?http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775710000750\n[5]: Microsoft Women Mentoring Program\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/women-at-microsoft/default.aspx\n[6]: How long should it take a new hire to get up to speed?\nhttp://www.askamanager.org/2010/07/how-long-should-it-take-new-hire-to-get.html", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Y.

STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths.

Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience.

If Opt Extension was cancelled, I believe the international students will dramatically decreased, if that day comes, the United States is the biggest loser!\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lucia Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5548", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Students are future of a Nations and this is indeed a good constructive steps.

In the meantime, the international students are the superpower for consumption, which will stimulate the internal economy through the large consumption power, one of the clear examples is the car consumption. If expanding OPT for STEM degrees, international students who are now studying in their own country are more willing to study in USA, this move will bring more hot money to universities and other internal industry as well, boosting the consumption of USA and stimulate the the U.S. economy. \n\nSecondly, going through the stories of US history, it is the miracle made by different kinds of people, different kinds of colors and also different kinds of nationalities. It is the capable peoples will from different countries and their pioneering spirits that make US different, this different in return attracts more talented and intelligent people from all over the world to America, bringing their knowledge, willingness, perspective to build US, to chase their own dream on an alien continent. US is like a magnetic, sucking plenty of human resources, especially talented people related with STEM to America, and using foreigners hands to build America. OPT and H1b is not a rule that eliminate the opportunities for hiring more americans, it is a nuclear weapon that make America stronger and powerful in the global world perspective. \n\nBecause of OPT, OPT extension and H1b, silicon valley and lots of tech miracle happened in America is possible.

Being a STEM student from an accredited US university, I'm in favor of the proposed rule for following reasons. \n\n1) Expanding OPT upto 3 years in the new proposed rule not only gives a training benefit to the students but also provides a good number of home grown STEM workers to US employers. These employers will not only benefit from the expertise gained by these students in US universities but also by a student's insight into their respective home/foreign markets and thus benefitting the US employer. \n \n2) I have read and heard a lot of arguments where it is often stated that OPT STEM workers are a source for \"cheap labor\". So far whatever I've seen from my employment experience is not all US employers hire foreign workers its only a handful of them. Those who employ foreign workers like me offer competitive compensation, which of course is decided by education level as well as professional experience. All of my ex employers have offered me the market rate as they would have offered to an American worker. Moreover, I was told they would sponsor H-1B which adds on to their expenses. I can be sure about this as I had the opportunity to be involved in one of my ex employers budgeting session where a budget was set aside for a role irrespective of the nationality of the worker.\n \n3) As a part of Software Industry I have seen how my previous employers have struggled to find STEM workers to backfill positions. It can take upto several weeks or several months. This proposed rule would definitely increase the available STEM pool making it easy for US employers.\n \n4) As numerous F-1 students have huge student loans back in their home countries; this program gives the student a chance to take care of their financial responsibilities while contributing to the US economy. \n\n5) This proposed rule also re-instates CAP GAP relief which is much needed in case an OPT student is approved H-1B as it allows them to maintain their legal status until H-1B starts.  \n\n6) Lastly, it would be beneficial if this rule gets implemented in a timely manner, as not doing so will be disruptive in a financial aspect for a great number of employers as well as several thousands of students who will be at risk of losing their status.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2666", "postedDate": "2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Great steps towards enforcing States tech power!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lee John", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0647", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposal. \nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields.

By mentioning 'chance to learn' I don't only mean that you can learn in campus, but also that you could have a change to get in to company and apply what you have learned in to real life practice. I have to say lots of my friends and also me decided to come to America for graduate study because of the existence of OPT. Otherwise I can totally choose the United Kingdom, France or other country and get  my master's degree in a shorter period.\n\nAs what I said before, OPT allows lots of STEM students be able to apply what they learned at top schools to real life practice, which is providing huge productivity America. Check out how many employees at computer companies are from former OPT students. Without such workers those companies would lose huge productivity and results in more job loss for the following supply chains.\n\nPeople may say OPT may raise competition against native American workers, that is not totally false for some international companies, but please there are much more companies that is for Americans only, which provide much more job opportunities than the number of OPT positions. More importantly, even for the companies that accept OPT students, only a few of them could stay at the end with critical skill, which is totally not a bad thing for the US. As I know, China and other countries are offering great benefit to attract its over-sea students back to its own country, and the OPT is one of the biggest reason for the elite students decide to stay in the U.S.\n\nAmerica managed to became one of the most developed country because of it provide opportunities for people all over the world and attracted those most creative and talent guys.

I do have mine.  I mean, look at all those successful leaders of the High-tech companies, many of them are just like us, used to be an international student full of hopes and bold thoughts for the future. If not because of them, who knows where would we learn about the technologies from. Maybe not so many students who expect to learn new stuffs would not come to the Unite State but somewhere else!  Not to mention the GDP increment.\nYet now, we are treated as threads of the local folks who think themselves are not competitive as us, and are so afraid that we steal their job opportunities. As a matter of fact, the company who is hiring would have known what kind of person they are expecting for their positions. Even if there are not so many companions, does anyone really thinks they will lower their expectation on the positions that could bring fortune to the company or make progress on the project? If so, I highly doubt the future of the industry. \nSo the question becomes quit simple, BE THE BEST. Please do not expect us to leave the country and let you get the jobs. Get them because you really can! And so that you can see we are not threads and we are not stealing the chances. And because of that the United State can have more powerful resources of brilliant people and gain a better future. \nThe OPT extension is just one way to see if we really can make contribution here. If we can not, then automatically no one would hire us; while if there are needs of us to work here, then that means we are helpful. Doesn't that make sense?

By passing this rules, studying in American will be more attractive than in UK or Australia. That's to say, each international students will not only pay large amount of tuitions, but also additional insurance, health care, clothes, food and tours. These will benefit the economy with no doubt. \nSecondly, after their graduation, you may think they could take the advantage the extension of OPT. DON'T MAKE IT WRONG. Every company will only choose the right person to fit the position. The market for international students is very limited. Because of the statues, they have to be very smart, well - educated and hard working. Even though, some excellent student were rejected by many companies. Why? Most companies have set the ratio of foreign labors. Many job descriptions are like \" citizen or GC holders only\"! They have to make sure the most part of employees are citizens or GC holders, because they don't want to become a H1B dependent, which will get them in trouble. Therefore, by passing this rule, it will provide a little more chance for excellent students to get hands on experience. \nAdditionally, international students who have the experience on working in foreign companies, will be likely to contribute to international business cooperation. Most of the students are from wealthy families. With a well education background, it's much easier for them to get a good job when they are back to their countries.  They will be the leaders in many aspects. They will be likely to cooperate with American companies, rather than others, because of those working experience. I think it will benefit America and Americans a lot.

We bore that proudly. We took this job, not because of the money, ($378.00 a month) Not for the education, But because WE KNEW, we were protecting those we left behind.

OPT for STEM students is a student training program that does not place any foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition or the education competition. Instead, this student training program attracts more foreign students come to US for study. Colleges increase the number of foreign students without sacrificing any education opportunity of US citizens. The foreign students pay tuition and spend money in US. This provides more local job openings and increases local economic. \n2. The OPT program does not cause US Citizens AND Veterans out of work. Foreign students are only allowed to be trained (OPT) in their specified field of study, only when there is no suitable US-citizen job candidate other than international students. Especially in STEM, there is a lack of suitable candidate. Stopping STEM OPT expansion will hurt STEM companies and US economic.  \n3.

A country needs the diversity. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings. Diversity of cultures can also prevent biased or partial collective opinions and behaviors in this country. \n\n2. STEMmajor students can continuously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. U.S. has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes the country strong and thriving. The dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industries could not have been so prosperous, e.g. IT. The science and technology is the key to the further advancement of the U.S economy which benefits everyone of Americans. So in order for the future economy, we should allow those students holding F-1 visa stay longer.\n\n3. Some argue that those international students create intense competition for jobs in the U.S. In fact, this is a good thing in a long run. The competition can push the majority of our citizens to enhance and increase their skills and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. As we know, citizens already have a natural edge when competing with foreigners because they do not need sponsorship and they have language advantage. We should probably blame our elementary education in STEM instead of immigrants if our citizens still find it hard to land a job in STEM field with all these advantages! If we let the tremendous amount of skill-equipped human resources outflow from the U.S only because of weak competitive power of our citizens., then it will be an unestimated loss to our domestic companies and to the country as a whole. If our domestic companies are no longer able to compete with foreign companies hiring more talented workers who once studied in our country and eventually lose global market share, then our domestic industries will be severely impacted and unemployment rate of citizens will go even higher.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Flora Wanderwood", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14785", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I believe in AMERICANS first, if we have excess work, then extra help would be needed, BUT this is not the case, we have too many people out of work and do not need FOREIGN workers.

Yes, I would say. But, there is a huge BUT here, how would things be like if things go to the other side without any help of international labors? Does it really make sense if everyone's wage are higher? Enough labors make the economic grows fast. Inefficient labor in the market will make the price go up due to more human hour cost.

The truth is there is a serious shortage in the job market for STEM workers, and that those unemployed citizens cannot help eliminate this shortage. Cited from an article in 2012 by Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Economic projections point to a need for approximately 1 million more STEM professionals than the U.S. will produce at the current rate over the next decade if the country is to retain its historical preeminence in science and technology.\"\n\nWe can also see that DHS is wise in ruling out those foreign STEM students that are not qualified to satisfy the need of economy. The rule says that the unemployment time for foreign STEM students is limited (90 days for initial OPT and 60 days for extended OPT), and that students must be working in the field of STEM to be eligible for OPT extension.\n\nIn conclusion, the rule guarantees that the foreign students only contribute to the STEM field where there is a critical labor shortage. I sincerely believe DHS is proposing a wise rule, and that we should stick to this rule if there is no better rules proposed.

After graduating in May 2015 with double majors in Computer Science and PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), I started working for Electronic Arts in Redwood City on their Corporate Strategy team. Currently on OPT from my F1 student visa from Penn, I will be applying for H1B in 2016. Without the OPT extension program, I will have only one chance to pass H1B lottery, which means I'll very likely lose my job and have to leave this country.\n\nA top performer in my class for my entire academic career, I've always been pushing myself to see a bigger world, to learn more intellectually, to pursue my passion, and to live to the fullest of my potentials. This drive for excellency and creativity has taken me from China to a top US university and now to Silicon Valley, the high-tech center of the world. I know that I love the intersection between business, tech and liberal arts, and I love games as a form of art. Working on the business side of EA is an ideal job for me, and I feel genuinely happy every day knowing that I'm working on something that I enjoy and is bringing happiness to tens of millions of people. I can't wait to put what I learned into more awesome work and build up my life and my career here in California step by step.\n\nBut now this dream seems rather distant with the uncertainty of H1B lottery and the lack of OPT extension.\nWhen I was a freshman in college and wasn't bothered by these visa hurdles ahead, I thought my life was full of possibilities. Yet I gradually learned about how much hassle I need to go through to work as an international student, both from my friends' experiences and from my own. Job hunting was tough for me, with many companies rejecting applicants upfront if they realize the student will be on OPT (aka very likely to be forced to leave after a year) or realizing it later in the process and stopping it right there. Personally I have even had my offer rescinded once because of this. I can understand the extreme frustration on the employer side as well.\n\nI've always believed that efforts should be rewarded in any decent societies. If I work hard and take the right approach, I should be able to get to where I want.\n\nIt frustrates me when I realize it is not the case when it comes to H1B. It's a lottery. It doesn't matter how hard I work, and there's nothing I can do about it. I've seen some of the brightest of my peers forced to leave their dream job, their apartment, their friends and the life and career they've built. If OPT is extended for another 24 months, at least we can have more chance to stay here.\n\nThis strong sense of helplessness just swallows and suffocates me. Despite all my education and efforts, I am still not welcomed here, and can be forced to leave everything immediately like a thief. What have we done to deserve this?\n\nSo that is my story. I know that a lot of people understand OPT as tech companies' conspiracy to get cheap labor or consider high skill immigrants a threat to American jobs. This is, honestly, quite insulting. The truth is there are so many people like me - Ivy League or other top notched university educated and are willing to contribute to this country - who depend on H1B to stay here. Are we still \"cheap labor\" after all our high education at top-notched institutions? Do people just assume tech companies hire us to save money even after we went through several rounds of interviews to prove ourselves capable of the position, and our compensations are nowhere lower than our American colleagues? Trust me - for my generation of immigrants with great career aspiration and skills that can earn me a good life anywhere in the world, we did not come to the US to be cheap labor.\n\nA lot of my friends came and left quietly, without leaving a word; but I believe in the power of speaking up and telling my story, and I am willing to do so. Reality is tough, but there is always something we can do to push forward.\n\nOnward and upwards!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jing Ran", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10974", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "What is the GOP doing to stop Obama's foreign invasion of foreign workers?  \nThe GOP has the power of the purse and it is time to defund all H1-B visas and demand\nAmerican workers and graduates come first.

I am about to complete my master degree in computer science this December. Clearly, I have little expertise in public policy given my area of study. However, I would like express some of my personal opinions as an \"outsider\" and hope they would be of any help in the finalization process. \n\n1. From my understanding, the opposing argument of the STEM extension centered on the concern that international students has been increasing the competition in the U.S. job market. This has becoming a \"threat\" to U.S. citizens as the latter finds it difficult to be employed. This seems true, but in fact makes no sense. From my personal experience in job seeking, international students are much less favored given their immigration status. Employers prefer candidates with citizenship or permanent residency simply because they do not require sponsorship to start the job. At the same time, the cost of hiring an international student is much higher, considering the sponsorship fee and especially the risk that after a long-term training they may leave the country unwillingly due to work authorization such as failure to win the H1B lottery. This lead to the unfairness in job seeking where candidates with citizenship and permanent residency are on the much more advantageous side. International students, on the other hand, have to be exceptional for the same position.\n\n2. Students affected by this policy are those who study science, technology, engineering, and math education. I have reasons to believe that students in these areas, regardless of immigration status, intelligent and well-educated. They think logically and believe in reasons. They are well aware that success comes from hard work and excellencies, and nothing else. They also know very well that competition drives progress. In this competitive world, U.S. has been in the leading position for almost a hundred years because a large group of intelligent engineers and scientists immigrated to this land of opportunity during World War II. It is of U.S.' best interest to retaining this position by keeping the most intelligent students after their graduation and encouraging them to stay and serve this country. Clearly, without STEM extension and the shortage on H1B visas, international students would have to leave the U.S. and find a job in their home country. I personally do not see any cons to those students themselves in terms of their career path. However, speaking of the hard fact, if the extension is not favored, the U.S. trains international students to be the best with its educational resources and send them back to serve the countries which may be competitors to this country. This does not seem to be a decision with visions, and definitely not favors the body of people in the U.S.\n\n3. At Columbia University, I benefit from the diversity where I have the opportunity to interact with people with different background. I believe this also holds true for most of the U.S. universities that the major body of students, and even faculty members, have international background. At the same time, U.S.' technology industry heavily depends on international employees. Take myself as an example, I had the opportunity to work as an software engineer intern at Facebook, Inc. this summer. In my team of 12, we had engineers from Russia, China, Japan, Ukraine, and Poland. While we worked together for the company, we also had the chance to experience different cultures and learn different languages. My experience suggests that this policy definitely contributes to, stabilizes, and further improves the U.S. economy. Without OPT and its extension, the technology industries such as Google and Facebook would end up in a devastating situation with the majority of their employees losing their work authorization.\n\nWith these in mind, I strongly support the 24-month STEM extension.

If this rule is not approved, foreign college graduates in STEM can still find jobs within one year. But after one year they leave, taking the technology and work experience to the competitor countries of the United States. Some European countries are now facing crisis. The one difference between US and Europe is that US was created and developed by mostly foreigners--immigrants from Europe, Asia and other continents.\n\nBased on macroeconomics(as shown in attachment), the aggregate supply will increase by lower paid labor supply and promote the US GDP growth. By growing its GDP, the United States will return more job opportunities to domestic workers and the inflation is more controlled than that if US GDP drops. If the United States lose tens of thousands of experienced foreign workers, it endangers its economic growth and may come to GDP recession. In the long-run, losing foreign workers may cause US people to pay higher prices for commodity, buy services and products from foreign countries for higher prices, less real money in the money market, equity and house prices drop which lead to decreased wealth, jeopardize exporting etc.. After those foreign workers go back to their own country, they will help other countries to grow which is no good to the US. Not approving this rule and let foreign workers go home may cause more US citizen to lose jobs in the long-run as the US economy worsens, only to benefit less US citizens.\n\nMost of the foreign workers pay more than one fourth of their salaries for taxes. And they're at the same time consumers which helps US business to sell more to increase the aggregate demand, therefore further increase US GDP. \n\nIf the US government is smart, it could calculate how much the nearly 20-year education costs for a qualified STEM worker. And the education of the foreign workers are paid by workers' parents and their countries. If it rejects those foreign workers, it also rejects the free pre-college education they carry. if they now let foreign workers leave after one year's work, in future US government need more money for STEM students education and it requires every single domestic worker to pay more taxes.\n\nAnother plus for the US government and citizens of this rule is it probably will attract more foreign STEM students to study in the US if they believe US has a favor of STEM foreign workers and they have enough time to practice their knowledge. The tuition and their living expenses would be a large part of the US's income and it again definitely helps the economy. \n\nI'm very proud to be a foreign STEM worker and I like my company and colleagues who are my good friends. I'd like to continue working with them with the enforcement of this rule. I graduated from Universities in Asia, Europe and the US and this rule applies to me. \n\nI hope this rule be approved and the benefits to arrive to the foreign STEM workers, US economy and eventually every US citizen in the near future. \n\n\nSincerely,\nJ.F.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by JS Fang", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12511", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree with the proposal regulation because it is a huge step forward to non-immigrant Students with STEM degree.

USA can just make use of this principle, make use of their 3 years with PEAK IQ and then let them go back to their own country. This is definitely a WIN WIN situation.\n\nAs for the STEM students, they are willing to be back to the home country after some working experience in USA because these working experience can help them to find a very good job in their own country. Why will they always stay at USA without relatives and friends? Nope. \n\nTherefore, STEM students can make use of the \"working experience at USA\" and USA can make use of the \"peak IQ of the STEM students\". That is wonderful. Nowadays, the world is dominated by technology. STEM students are the \"technology\", and they are creative and smart, which can help make USA better and better.\n\nLet's go back to the those natives who are afraid of being robbed of their jobs. Those natives must admit the fact that in this world, the ABILITY counts. If a technology company clearly knows that you are far not as smart as STEM students, why will they hire you? Even without STEM students, you still have no chance to get a job at those technology companies. When you have no jobs, DO NOT blame others. Improve yourself is the only way.\n\nSo I STRONGLY AGREE with this proposal. And I am very excited to see that the extension is from 17 months to 24 months. I think the US government has made a very smart decision.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Daniel Anderson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17496", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because it will give smart and hard working students an opportunity to find employment and succeed in the US.

However, this opinion is unilateral and arbitrary.\nFirst of all, the foreign students contribute the American economy in various aspects.\nAs a foreign student, the tuition fee is normally higher compared with native student. Not even mentioning the financial aids that are mostly adaptable for only native students. Therefore, foreign students play a significant role in the education industry, helping universities to provide better education and better life for not only the foreign students themselves, but the native students. Moreover, foreign students bring dynamic culture and academic elements into American education industry which would keep the universities in the States on a high level.\n\nOn the other side, foreign students add up the temporarily population around the school which would contribute to the local economy, creating more job opportunities. Please considering the restaurants, auto industry, accommodation industry, commodity industry and so many more. As there is a law against international students working out of school, those job opportunities created by the industries mentioned above are purely for native workers.\n\nSecondly, there is no direct evidence showed that opt extension would damage the native workers opportunities. The isolate number, 43 thousands jobs were put out of the native workers by foreign students, could not be considered as a key clue for the reason against OPT extension program. The reason is that according to Wall Street and other statistic data, the unemployment rate of the U.S. is dropping constantly from 2010. Now, Oct. of 2015, it even reaches the lowest point in the past 7 years, 5.0%. Therefore, it is considerably insufficient if to prove that OPT extension program would harm the work market. After all, unemployment is bothering every country since the civilization was ever built by human kind. It would not be so simply solved by cutting off foreign students who will only be qualified for working 2 more years.\nThirdly, instead of putting native workers out of jobs, foreign students filled up the gap of American labor pool for a solid number of small to median sized companies. It is well known that there are restrictions on foreign students who are using OPT program. There are notable working opportunities out there only for native workers, especially from large corporations and sensitive industries. As a consequence, foreign students normally gain their working experiences in small to median sized companies. Due to cost consideration, these companies would not be capable of offering the same treatments compared with large companies. It is not determined by the foreign students, but the free economy. On the other hand, for foreign students who came all the way to the States to improve their professional skills in the most developed country in the world, working experience is sometimes more valuable than the salary itself. Thus, it is not only a win-win solution that leads foreign students to those less attractive job opportunities offered by small to median sized companies, but it is also an outcome of natural selection. However, is this situation went against any law? The answer is no. No matter the size of the company, the state law of minimum wage and the law that industry average salary must be met for OPT students are always been abide by any legal company.\n\nLast but not least, canceling the OPT extension program might cause negative effects. Considering the discussion above, it is highly possible that the following happens:\n1.Foreign students come to the States for not only academic purpose but also working experiences, especially for STEM students. With out the OPT extension program, a significant downfall might take place for the currently vivid education industry. Moreover, with the number of international student shrinking, the local economy might be harmed in an uncertain extent. \n2.As where most of the current OPT students are working for, the small to median sized companies might face a huge challenge for their human resources changing that they are far from ready for. These companies contribute a significant part on the road of American economy reviving. Canceling OPT extension would possibly end up as a drawback to the economy and even increase the employment rate if those companies could not survive. And I believe this is not a happy ending for any native worker.\n\nTo sum up, I think the OPT extension program would bring more pros than cons to the American economy which would benefit the American society and everyone who is a part of it.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yihan Bai", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13006", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposal.

Extending the OPT for STEM graduate students will not reduce the job opportunities for U.S. citizens as they will not seek for jobs in STEM area even if there are no international students in US.  Without the extension in STEM, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and so on will lose many employers and I don't think they can recruit so many engineers and scientist from U.S. citizens. The leading positions of these companies will also be replaced soon by other companies with excellent students in STEM area. With the OPT extension policy, technology companies will keep developing and making profits.\nThe second reason is that the huge number of international students in U.S. strongly stimulates the economy in US. International students pay expensive tuitions and buy a lot of stuffs for everyday life. Their friends and family often come to U.S. for visiting, and this also stimulates the development in tourism and retailing.

If the US can't even keep its promises, it would be a shame and less and less international students will come or contribute to the US. \n\nSecond, it will benefit the US in a long-term. the US is an immigration country, it's famous for its freedom and its \"American Dream\".

They have scientific and technical skills that some Americans don't have. They work for US firms here so the firms will have high-end techniques to develop new products to benefit the Americans! \n\nIf some Americans think international students are competing with them in getting a job because OPT students get paid cheaper, then they are terribly wrong!!!! First, the pay is the same. They are not workers who compete for a McDonald's job (no offense to McDonald's). They are STEM students who have special and valuable skills!!! Maybe some Americans should also argue that their neighbors shouldn't have too many kids because when they grow up, they will steal jobs, causing more competitions as well!! That's just ridiculous!

They think differently and they will inspire American employees in all kinds of ways, especially when it comes to team work! \n\nLast but not least, the US will truly thrive if it continues to be embracing, and let the best people contribute to this country, even for just a few years. It does make a huge difference. This way the US can really keep leading the world because it's attracting the most skillful and talented people to come serve this country and its people. \n\nSo this proposal must pass! Don't be narrow-minded. The whole world is providing its best people to help build a better America. Don't say no.

By providing an opportunity of boots on the ground training in industry, the students will be far more competitive than the new graduates, because in STEM fields practice and experience is as important as knowledge, if not more. Because of the increased international student enrollment, universities, especially public ones can have more funds available to improve the education environment and will lead to better chance in scientific and technological breakthrough.\n\nThe living cost of international students also boosts local business, such as lodging, dining, retails and transportation. I've seen so many college towns have boosted since the increased enrollment of international students. Moreover, the increased number of students leads to increased tourism income. The existence of spring break, summer break, fall break and Christmas season gives the students more free time and opportunities to travel to different parts of US than average citizens or even foreign visitors, thus leads to increased tourism income.\n\nThe OPT is also an important part in the pipelining of immigrant reformation that has been worked on for years. A foreign student at their younger age has costed US ZERO dollars for the education beforehand and will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to be educated in US. He/she will graduate at the most productive age with the first tier education in the world, with which they can easily have a great career anywhere. Comparing to a similar US citizen, these students cost way less social resources to be brought to similar competency, and it will be a great deal to make them contribute to the society, such as federal and state income tax. If they return to their home country afterward, they can no longer claim the rights proper to their contribution; and if they end up a permanent residence or citizen, they still cost less than an average US citizen. Also note that many major scientific and technological breakthroughs were contributed heavily by highly educated immigrants of STEM majors, and nobody knows what happens next. Comparing to immigrant from other sources, these students have better chance and time to get familiar with US culture as well as the ideology, and will be less liability to the society than under educated immigrants, or even a citizen who constantly lives on the social stipends.\nMany comments addressed social security issues. But if they do not pay the fair share in their later life which covers the vacancy during OPT, they will be treated as any other US citizen who don't have a job for 24 months.\n\nIn conclusion, this OPT extension will be a major improvement to the current program and US's immigration system.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jian Cui", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12902", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please extend the opt to 24 months.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months. In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests. Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n \nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYanting Wu", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yanting Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18268", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Stem extension is beneficial to US economy and it is a great way to keep the development of US technology.

It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nI suggest that at a minimum, the tech companies should be required to demonstrate that they cannot get sufficient employees from the existing pool of American citizen and permanent immigrants to fill their jobs, even if some training might be required. The criteria the companies should meet should be vigorous but not impossible.\n\nJohn H.

The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.\nImmigration policy should serve in the interests of America, not against it. Congress should have stopped this when Bush first proposed it. It should be of more concern to Homeland that no student be admitted to the program from any place that is not a fully qualified ally of the United States and sympathetic with our ideology. Homeland should not allow any foreign citizens to be in the country without tracking the current status of each and every one of them at all times.

Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore. But finally I decided to go to USC is because I noticed that after my graduation I would get a 12+17 months industry training. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nThen I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at VSCO, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nAt last, since I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I love my country very much, and I believe that the economics of China will definitely bloom in the future. I would return back China eventually, not only because of my trust about China but also my family is there. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market in China.

This is a Negative against an American worker.      \n\n#2 He said foreign workers won't leave the job;  sure they won't, actually they can't while on visa sponsored by the company.   This is another Negative against an American worker.\n\n#3 He said they are paid less.   Again, this is another Negative against an American worker.\n\nThese visas are HARMFUL to well-educated Americans.    Why would a company hire an American that expects a fair salary for his/her services;   can look for work elsewhere whenever he/she wants and may leave if treated unfairly;  especially when the company can own an H-1b visa worker and hold him/her hostage for a green card.\n\nIt's time to consider the well-being of our American STEM graduates first.\n\nAdditionally,\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Grassley stated (in a letter to DHS Secretary Johnson):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\n\"The proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigrat ion Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael Emmons", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6168", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We need to start looking out for our own, United States citizens before foreigners!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Nancy Trocke", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3003", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Let this succeed!!!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Feng Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9360", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This kind of legislation only opens the door to further abuse of the foreign worker visa system (H-1B), by US corporations, and endangers the livelihoods of skilled, working Americans.\n\n<<  Begin excerpt from UC Davis Professor Norm Matloff's essay on H-1B visas >>\n<<  Link: http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/h1b.html  >>\n\nThe underpayment of H-1Bs is well-established fact, not rumor, anecdote or ideology.

However, the job market still need tons of people who has more advanced math knowledge, for example, data analyst. The second point I want to make is that 12 month OPT is really too short. For instance, one student got a job offer from a company. However, he didn't get his H-1b visa because of the low rate (only 1 out 4 can get the visa last year). If there is no OPT extension, this company will lost the person they spend a lot of time and effort to hire, not because of this person not behaving good at work (most of the time, the person will be a hard worker), just because of the unfair OPT policy. It will influence a lot of American companies and make them wasting time and money. Finally, I don't think expanding OPT for F-1 student will hurt their American people's employment rate.

STEM degree and jobs have been among the top luring subjects for international students to come to USA. The proposed rule to extend STEM OPT EXTENSION to 24-months will help both the students and the government. When higher education degrees are granted to other nationalities, offering jobs in the same country to put use the same valued education is the best bet for the right justice to the degree. \n\nApart from the 12-month initial OPT, getting a 24-months extension will help lot of students gain real world experience putting their degrees to the right use where they earned it. If the student decides to continue to apply the earned experience in the right channels that is within the US, applying for another work visa(H1B) would be much more feasible now. Few students struggle to get employed right after college and miss one opportunity to enter the lottery based H1B application system. Even with the most advanced degrees in the field, luck also plays a factor in getting a job or searching for the right opportunities. This 24-month extension will help students apply for H1B lottery twice(in some cases thrice) allowing them to cut down the fear of being out of status. Being unlucky does count in this sense.\n\nThe mentoring and training plan will also be a great initiative boosting employer-employee relationship in helping the company grow with the right talents. Advanced degrees are prominent in all fields now and people are leaving no stone unturned. Relevant experience also has its importance but an advanced degree provides better insight on wider growth. Releasing an official document with the participating list of companies willing to hire OPT and STEM OPT students will help majority of the students to align their interests in the right track to gain experience. Graduates with no corporate experience have a lot to gain with this training plan, where one gets to live and work in a real office with real projects and timelines for 3 years of work permit. If need be and the student decides to continue as a worker, they can apply for H1B visa or go for another advanced degree. Ability to chose another higher degree and work another 3 years on another OPT is again a stardom point in this proposed rule.\n\nI hope this proposed rule will increase the amount of full-time jobs in STEM fields, rather than the budget seeking, wavering contract jobs students are kind of forced into. If companies hire students out of college with higher degrees to be put to good use within the country it is a win-win for both of them. It would be great if the process of applying for the remaining term of extension for the already approved 17-month OPT EXTENSION be minimal and fee free. Least a student wants is to be keeping track of his immigration status when all they want is to work, gain experience and earn a daily living.

Every year, majority of students come USA from all over the world. One reason is the high quality education USA can provide. Moreover, the other reason is these students can get opportunities to be employed by US companies during the OPT period. But the 12 months OPT is far from long enough for international students. Because most of the STEM projects need at least 3 years to complete. The employers surely hope their employee can make a such long time promise before offer them jobs. But right now, the H1B quota is limited. Lots of people cannot get their H1B in the first lottery. That means they have to leave America after their 12 months OPT exhausts. Considering this, the employers may not be happy to offer jobs for international students. A 24 months extension can help these students. Also, it benefits employers. They have more possible to hire high quality employees and contribute to American economy and prosperity eventually. \n\nRight now, more and more markets rise from various country around the world. If American companies hope to explore these oversea markets, they have better employ the people from those countries, who are more familiar the place where they grow up, and they can help their American employers make correct and effective policy. Therefore, international students are a great bridge between American companies and these oversea markets.\n\nOPT extension won't induce unqualified labors be retained in America for a long time. Because the extension application needs a positive review from companies or institutes. Unqualified labors are not possible get a positive review from employers.\n\nLast but not least, international students won't rob jobs of native people. OPT extension requires the employers must be e-verified, which means these employers commit their job hiring is equality to every person from every country. So all of the candidates compete the jobs equally, no matter they are international or native.

The STEM students are highly educated, graduating with a bachelor's, master's or even PhD degrees in engineering/ technology. Most of them are working at high-tech companies, research institutions, making a huge contribution to not only America's economy, but also science and technology.\n\n2.If OPT extension is canceled, more than 10 thousand people will have to leave the country, leaving the positions empty, and the high-tech companies have to find the qualified people to fill the positions by February ( The majority of the positions need professional, experienced skills, they are not like jobs in McDonald's that everybody can do). If they cannot find the right candidates to fit these positions in time, it would be a big loss to those high-tech companies, and it would be a big loss to this country as well.\n\n3.Some people are worried that the STEM students would \"steal\" the jobs from American citizens. They are not stealing jobs, on the contrary, they are \"creating\" jobs. These foreigners are contributing to the economic growth by working and living here, they create products, inventions, and they consume goods, groceries and pay tax. These all fuel economic growth. Once the economy is good, jobs are created. OPT extension policy was made in 2008, when the US was suffering a great financial crisis, but look how good the economy is nowadays. I wouldn't say it's all because of the STEM extension policy, but it must have something to do with it.\n\n4.Indeed there are still some Americans who cannot find a job, they are still suffering unemployment. But these are not high-tech jobs for sure. Actually, the amount of the jobs that need engineering, technology background is larger than the amount of qualified candidates this country can offer domestically today. That is why they need international students. And as far as I know, the internationally students have to send the proof of their majors, diplomas, the companies' names they are working for to get a work authorization, and there are other strict restrictions too, such as the international students will lose their work authorization and leave the country immediately if they keep unemployed for 3 months or work at a non-stem position. So there's no way they will compete with those unemployed Americans. Plus, the number of the H1B visas is limited, which avoids too much immigration as well.\n\n5. If we take a look at the US history, the reason why it became the greatest country in such a short time and still keeps leading the world is because IT WELCOMES TALENTED, CREATIVE PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD. And the STEM students are one of them. They are making a great contribution to this country with their intelligence and perspiration, I cannot imagine what America would be if it deported those talented, intelligent elites.\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jon Smith", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19958", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is very helpful for F1 students.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my prospective employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1st, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. For me, this experiential learning will allow me to integrate financial knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in an asset management firm or investment firm. All these integrated experience will lay a solid foundation to my future career life. If I am back to China immediate after I graduate, I will have a difficult time trying to applying what I learnt to the Chinese market. In that sense, I should go for a Chinese university instead of universities in the United States, because I would learn more knowledge related to Chinese market, and I am also able to build network in the meanwhile. Thus, without the hand in experience in the United States, the education I received here will be much less meaningful.  \n\nSecondly, these benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. As STEM program applies to the high- tech involved majors, namely science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The cancellation of OPT extension will lead a large amount of technology staff to leave the United States. These technology companies, who already spend a lot of time energy, and wealth in investing these staff, have to start from the beginning one more time. Also, after leaving the United States, these technology staff will go back to their home country and work for similar companies, which will become strong competitors for the companies in the United States. \n\nThus, the OPT STEM extension should be retained for the benefit of both STEM students and Employers.

To my knowledge, a lot of important positions in major companies like Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Yelp, and other companies are taken by internationally students. If they lose their legal ability to work in the U.S., the situations of those major tech companies can be very seriously jeopardized.

I could apply what I have learnt in the school right after graduation and gain enough practical experience in the industry during this period. This will help me prepare a better career. And I believe, this is also the reason that thousands of international students leave their own home, going aboard to seek for higher degree.  One year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.\n\nI have been working as a Software Engineer for two years. Based on my experience, 12-months seems not enough for a new graduate to learn and acquire skills and experience.

This expansion would allow the foreign talents to join the U.S. high tech company after they get their degree and make contribution to the federal tax income in a long term. New graduates get into the industry will have very limited chance to continue grow and make contribution to the tech field if they cannot get long enough support from the immigrant law. If we do not have the OPT extension rule, most young talents in STEM area will only have one chance to obtain their H1B working VISA, which means they have over 50% of chance to lose their job due to their foreign identity but not their lack of working ability. A foreign talent can be hired by a STEM company because he has the quality that is suitable for the continuous development of the company not because it is cheaper and easier for a STEM company to hire foreign workforce. Everyone is equal in the United States of America. The foreign students get the chance to work in STEM industry means he can stand out from the all the other people and prove to be outstanding in this area. Don't make the spirit of adventure and the dream of America fade away due to the limited time after graduation to get settled down. \n\nThroughout the years of development, we have seen huge amount of foreign bright minds brought significant growth for the United States of America. We can see that the USA based immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies have employed 3.6 million workers around the world back in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the report. Right now it is 2015, the old OPT extension rule has been in function for about 5 years. That is right between the time of 2010 and 2015. People in the USA have witnessed the great growth of the internet industry and the blooming result of the mobile revolution and high tech benefits. This is due the effort of the company where foreign bright minds are hired and making contribution at. All the people who wants to stay using the OPT extension surely has the high possibility to continue stay in the United States of America after the expire of their F-1 OPT, probably convert to H1B working VISA and finally become a green card holder. These people will pay exactly the same amount of taxes as well as the U.S. citizen do within the first several years of their working period. This means people who use the F-1 OPT extension will surely shows their willing to stay and their ability to create and pay revenue to the country. This will eliminate the worry of hiring company abuse this extension to cut the wage and tax paid to the government.\n\nMost people worrying about losing the working chance in the competition with the STEM foreign students have a very short sight and stupid minds. With so much successful story of STEM people start brilliant new business and startup companies that created so much work position available to the society in the U.S. The voice of STEM foreign immigrants stole away their working opportunity is absolutely a joke right now. Their unwillingness of giving new chance to the new immigrant in STEM industry is just like the old European way of creating injustice and discrimination upon the people in the new land of America back in the old time. If you continue to show your arrogance and stay back with the protection of your citizenship of U.S. Then the American Dream will finally break and be prepared to get the punishment from right now rapidly growing entities like China and India.\n\nImmigration policy should serve in the growth of American revenue and to create more working chance rather than protecting the already existing right of the U.S. citizen. As a result, please get back the spirit of adventure and be ready to get another rocket of growth with so many young brilliant STEM minds waiting to make contribution to the society of the United States. You will see how good to the community, to the next generation, to the everlasting of the greatness of the United States of America if you continue to offer the chance of having Dream in The USA!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuzhou Cheng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16021", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This regulation brings cheaper labor to US economy, which brings extra power to boost the development.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Peng Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5083", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.\nSome American citizen think international students took their job, that's untrue.\nCompanies hire people based on their skills, international students work hard, that's how they get jobs.

More opportunities should be provided to STEM students. Some critics may argue that this rule will increase the unemployment rate and they believe by offering less opportunities to foreigners, the unemployment rate will be significantly lower. However. I believe this argument is not going to become. \nFirst, STEM majors are those most domestic students are not willing to learn. Lets say computer science. In the graduate program of my university, more than 80% of students are foreigners and only 20% are locals, including green cards. Notice that my university admits more foreigners are not because there are more smart people outside the country than domestic. In fact, my university put a more strict constraint when admit foreigners, GPA has to be higher than 3.5 and TOEFL scores more than 100. But, there are still more foreigner in the program than domestic, it is because less domestic students select this as their majors. And this is actually happened to most universities in US. So, foreigners only fill in those spots that domestics are not willing to take.\nSecond, because of the first point, foreigners are not big competitors of domestic students. In my university computer science department, domestic students are all already find good jobs and it is very common that they have several offers from big techs. Therefore, even though foreigners are not allowed to work in US, how can our domestic students benefit from that, more offers? This is actually true for many universities in US, therefore, even if US is not allowed foreigners to work here, the unemployment rate for CS students wont drop a lot.\nThird, if extension rule cannot pass, I am 100% sure that there will be a huge drop in the application to US universities in the next few years. By observing the large proportion of foreign students in each university, I am wondering how much revenue the universities are going to drop. Subsequently, how many people work in these universities may lose their jobs because of it. The overall unemployment rate may probably go down. Moreover, foreign students are powerful consumers. They need to rent apartments, purchase furniture, and so on. The big drop in application to universities will probably make those businesses, which largely depend on students go less profitable and even break up.\nForth, foreign students who are willing to take a lot to effort to come here are be able to find a job here are usually those who are talent and competitive people in their own countries. The recruiters here are smart and rational, they are not going to recruit foreigners who are not talent and good at their majors. In addition, they have to take into account the cost for sponsorship of working VISA. Therefore,  if two candidates with relative same strength in their professional skills, but one is foreigner and the other one is  local. Of course, this recruiter is going to recruit the local! Only very talent foreigners will get jobs in US. Every single country in this world is thinking how to attract talent people to their place and make contributions there. Are we going to close this door for foreigners?\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by You Cheng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18391", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Make American citizens number one priority, we pay the taxes, which pays your salary, which makes us your boss.

OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.\"\n\"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\nDHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n\"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\"\n\"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Martha Johnson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4324", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE.

A major problem is that this rule would provide superior help to students who are not American citizens, assistance which is not available to American students.  This discrimination is unconscionable.  Effectively the federal government would be taking better care of non-Americans than it does of American students.  A further result of such action is that it discourages American students and will surely drive many into other and probably less lucrative professions.  So this disadvantages the American student, but it also disadvantages the American employer and the American economy.\n\nThere is another problem:  why are we doing this?  There is no shortage of STEM workers or graduates in the U.S.  And the federal government's first obligation (or at least it should be) is to support Americans and American students.  Our immigration policies should be focused on actions that support the American people and the American economy.  When there is no shortage of STEM workers, it is unfair to American taxpayers to advance a program that has no marginal benefit to the country or to Americans.  So the whole premise of the program is faulty.\n\nThe OPT program has denied Americans 430,000 jobs from 2009 to 2013.  Such disloyalty to American workers is unconscionable.  But the disloyalty to Americans doesn't stop there.  This program has been funded from the Social Security Trust Fund and the Medicare Trust Fund, sources unrelated to the intent of the program, and trust funds that are in trouble financially as it is.  Bottom line is that we cannot afford to deplete these funds particularly for a program unrelated to the Funds primary intent and because it adds to the burden placed on American taxpayers to deliver these programs.  In the case of Social Security, American workers have already contributed to the Social Security Trust Fund and the government has a financial obligation to those workers.  By depleting the fund for other purposes, the government aggravates an existing financial shortfall.\n\nFurther discrimination against American workers results because this program provides a source of workers whom American employers can hire more cheaply.  Though this may help American employers, it does so penalizing American workers and American graduates.  Bottom line, rather than expanding this program, it should be eliminated altogether so long as it clearly hurts Americans rather than helping them.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ronald Pierce", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3568", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The US is consisted and supported  by people from different culture and background.

And most F1-students leave US after OPT, unless they are sponsored by the employers for H1B or Green Cards. \n\nThirdly, diversity is important for US. I believe US employers won't just hire foreigners just because they're cheap (in fact, they're not cheap). Hiring decisions should be based on talent.

When I was a undergraduate in the top 3 school in China, many of my classmate decide to further study abroad, such as US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason we choose U.S. is that US provide us the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. Thus opt-extension will attach more talented students to U.S. The development of the high technology in U.S. is indispensable of these talented STEM students' contribution.\n\n2. 12months regular + 24 months extension is a good fit for completing a project. In technology field such as software development, it usually takes 2 or 3years to fully complete one project. If opt-extension time is too short, STEM workers may not be able to work when the project is still in progress.\n\n3.

I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. . visit 1point3acres.com for more.\n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor.

The reasons are as follows:\n\n1) Stop saying no to well-educated population regardless their intention on immigration. The truth is, those who can gain OPT are at least undergraduates, which means they have bachelor degrees; a big portion of them have master's or even doctoral's diploma.To those right-wing extremists: please embrace the fact that most of them have received U.S. system funding for years during their education. If U.S. continues raise the bar for these population to stay in the U.S., this will be a lose-lose situation; \n\n2) OPT extension will not take jobs away from U.S. population. for H1B sponsors, a very important step during h1b application is that, they have to prove that noone in the U.S. can get this position. Not as strict as green card application, but very similar. USCIS and labor department examine cases very carefully so in this case very few bad cases can be approved. In another word, if two people stand in front of you, one is U.S. citizen/PR, and another is international student, 99% of the company will choose U.S. citizen/PR. Hiring a non-US citizen/PR means you have to hire an attorney and afford the fact that he or she might not obtain a h1b during the h1b lottery; \n\n3) longer OPT means no/extreme limited harm to U.S. legal and social system; on the other hand, it boosts U.S. economy: Don't forget the fact that F1 holders are a)well educated, and b)financial reliable, and c) definitely obeying the law. Most of the population are at lease MIDDLE-CLASS in their home country. Yes there might be some criminal cases here and there but generally they take care of themselves.  Financial reliable means they would like to purchase a car, a house or other things if they have a better view of their future (for a master STEM student, 2+3 = 5years; a PHD student, 5+3 means 8 years). Thinking about the fact is during this period of time, THEY PAY TAXES, PAY TUITION, PAY RENT, PAY GROCERIES, PAY MEDICAL BILLS, BUY CARS, EVEN BUY HOUSES ALL ON THEIR OWN OR THEIR FAMILIES. \n\n4) LONGER OPT won't change immigration procedure at this moment. OPT won't guarantee a greencard. Before getting a greencard YOU HAVE TO get the h1b lottery first. At this moment the H1b lottery system will still be there for a while so OPT extension is the only plan B for those companies need well-educated and well-trained workers.

We need to pay much more than local students in public universities, however, we accept this unequal treatment, because we believe that the education we get and the career prospects obtained from the experience will be very beneficial. But this time, we should not be the one who suffer from the broken immigration system in the United States nor should we bear the burdens of it. We need equal opportunities to get the most out of our education just like our fellow American students. \n\nToday, fewer and fewer American students want to pursue degrees in the STEM field and even fewer want to pursue advanced degrees. When I talked with American students about academic life, I often heard them complain about how they hated Math, Physics, and Chemistry. This year, the average SAT Math score fell to a historical low. This is not a good trend for America. If this continues, then our international students who study STEM will have to fill in the gap and take on the responsibilities of exploring new opportunities in science and technology. Only through this way will American economy grow in the long run. \n\nTherefore, I, like other hundreds of thousands of international students with STEM degrees, firmly believe that improving and expanding training opportunities for us is the correct, righteous, and necessary thing to do. It will help American economy recover and grow. \n\nFinally, a word for those local people who blame us for taking their jobs, how about improving your skills, refreshing your knowledge, working as diligently as we international students, majoring in STEM, and being competitive enough to not be easily taken a job from others? There are so many hardworking and intelligent people outside the United States who are paid much lower than workers in America.\nThe competition is fierce, so please step out of your comfort zone. Blaming others to cover your own weaknesses is a coward thing to do and will only do you harm at the end. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ran Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14056", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The OPT period is essential for the international students to further develop their trainings and skills in a setting that is outside the school.

The student basically has to leave the job right after they are trained and ready to make significant contributions to the industry. \nI agree that regulations such as that the students' work must be in line with their major are absolutely necessary. However, a broad definition of \"in line\" must be considered. For example, a chemistry student could have got extensive experience in computer programing and data statistics during his/her research. Consequently, a job in the programing area should not be considered outside of the student's training simply because that is not the traditional chemical industry.   \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ximeng You", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5044", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is very important for the benefit of american since STEM student's role in company is not replaceable.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting and provide more broader exposure to industries. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. \n\nA 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment through H!.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\n\nRegards,\nNaga Raju", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anantha Naga Raju Koppuravuru", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5462", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT extension for STEM degree students is very important to us.

This rule will allow them to stay in the country, give them multiple attempts in the H1-B visa lottery and eventually contribute towards the growth of the county.

With the quality of education being given to the students here in USA, international students should be retained and should be allowed to contribute to the country where they gained knowledge rather then forcing them to go back to their home country and serving some other country. This rule will not affect US students because most of the companies prefer to hire citizens and permanent residents because of work authorization issues with internationals.

With the requirement of E-verification for the expansion, people can make sure that all the students stay in America because THE COUNTRY NEEDS THEM. Also, because local American students get jobs much easier than equivalent international students, the expansion does not really impact the local students much. The reason of the expansion existence is that, America is truly in high demand of excellent employees with STEM Degree.\n\nRecent year U.S. economy recovered and rose. Information Technology made significant contribution to it. If OPT expansion is canceled, most of the IT companies including Google, Facebook, Amazon, will suffer from lacking of qualified employees.

All it's asking is to give a better chance to the foreign students to practice what they learned in the school.\n\nSecondly, I don't believe tech companies will hire international students just because they're \"cheaper\". If citizens are really better in the sense of technically background, I couldn't think of any reason they'll not be hired. The fact is that companies usually don't want to hire international students, because they only have one year OPT program and companies don't want to just spend one year to get someone up to speed but with no way to save them for years. I believe the foreign students are being hired because they are better and work harder. \n\nThirdly I agree this might create more pressure for Citizens to find a job. But I think competition is good for this case. The tech company needs creativity and passion, not just to hire someone who won't worry about losing jobs. I'm not the right person to say what's the truth about demand of STEM job market. I'm sure DHS will figure that out. If the demand is really larger than the supply, this should not be an issue.\n\nAt last, I couldn't really argue if this will encourage more and more foreign students to get to States. And some citizens who want to pursue STEM degree might not get accepted due to this fact. I guess there could be some restrictions about the percentage of foreign students at college. But once you have the skills or degrees, you'll have to earn the job yourself, not just asking the government to protect you and eliminate the competition.

With help of these people, science and technology of America will get progress quickly. American did that before and became most powerful country in the world. Now America need more talented people like that since STEM fields are more complicated than before. Getting a good result needs more people to work together. Thus, the extension should be much more important than that before.  \nAccording my person experience, the last four researches related to computer science are three years or fours years.

The reasons are as the following:\n\n1. The highly educated and skilled STEM students provide related US industries with very powerful \"new blood\", which is crucial to boosting US economy. In the past 8 years, we have observed many STEM students joining large companies within the technology, engineering, and even insurance industries. These STEM students have contributed to the growth of these big firms as well as the recovery of US economy in the post-crisis period. We can expect that with the proposed new rule, these companies and industries can continue to backup US economy recovery and growth. If these STEM students who have consumed the higher education resources in the US all go back to their home countries after graduation, it would be a huge loss not only for the US companies, but also for the US economy. The US is the only country that have this many highly educated and skilled STEM students employed in various industries, and this is one of the reasons why America has maintained its competitiveness in all these industries across the world.\n\n2. More international students would come to the US for higher education because of the improved opportunities in the OPT program, and more of them would choose to study STEM majors. These international students pay very high tuition to colleges and universities in the US, and they have been an important source of financial support for many educational institutions in the country. These students not only contribute to the development of higher education system in the US, but also bring up local economies and consumption in most of the areas where the universities are located.\n\n3. The new rule sets wage requirements for students on OPT and prohibits firing US citizen workers to hire F-1 students. The labor cost of hiring an F-1 student is at least on the same level as hiring a US citizen. All of these rules offer protection to US citizen workers in the related industries. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Max Gao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15074", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am strongly supporting this!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dongxu Jin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18473", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please expand training opportunities for STEM majored F-1 student.\nThis action can be beneficial to both people who are seeking for proper position in the U.S. that matches with their intellectual level, and the U.S. -- which has already spent a lot of time, resource and money to train these people well.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xin Qi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18980", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think this proposal is very necessary.

It does benefits international STEM students who would like to learn from work in the US and some of whom may want to stay in the US afterwards, but it benefits the US even more.\n\n1. US Universities and Colleges\nAll of us are aware of the importance of diversity. However, the percentage of international students in US universities and colleges has been declining.  OPT extension helps ensure that the US colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students.\n\n2. US Employers \nMany US companies, tech companies in particular, have stated that they are in short of qualified STEM graduates. Based on my experiences and my friends experiences interviewing with and working at big tech firms, I dont know any of the firms offers lower salary to employees working on OPT. I am not good at tax so have no idea about the tax impact, but to my knowledge, competence including professional skills, academic background, etc. is the most important factor in determining employment. The fact that there are a number of American graduates being unemployed while some international graduates being employed doesnt necessarily mean that the employers will consider to employ those Americans even without foreigners on OPT. The difference in competence does play a role. For example, a Computer Engineering graduate from Stanford and with a bunch of internship experiences would appear much more competent for an employer than someone from a community university and without comparable experiences.  With OPT extension, US employers benefit from having a bigger talent pool for them to get the best candidates in the world.\n\n3. US Employees\nSome beneficiaries of OPT started their own business after graduation or a few years after working in the US, actually creating job opportunities for the US employees. \n\nRegarding the concerns some people have over companies replacing American employees with non-citizens for reducing costs, I would argue that: (i) it is merely speculation since there is no solid evidence proving it is true, (ii) even if some companies are trying to do that, the new rules for improving oversight over STEM OPT extensions including adding wage and other protections will well address it.\n\nThe United States is great because it has the best people from all over the world.

It's history of success has a root in the history of immigration. The market has big potential and needs people invest their energy, thought and time. International students work hard because they have to in order to survive and stay. America needs such spirit. International students share cross cultural perspectives and usually bring in new thoughts. America needs that kind of people because globalization makes everything international. People who have multi culture background are valuable to American companies. International students are independent, smart, adventurous and a lot them have very interesting stories and experience that most Americans don't have. Those personalities and characteristics are part of American spirit: independent, brave, open and always strive for the better. Giving them more time to stay in the U.S. after they graduated is giving them a better chance to show their ability to contribute. Investing in talented people and give them time is beneficial in the long run.\n\nAs for the concern of international students taking jobs, I mean they are also creating new jobs and new chances. Most of them work in STEM, where needs is much greater than supply. Especially in tech fields and finance field, if companies couldn't hire enough qualified people, that would slow down their competitiveness.\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tianyun Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14311", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please refer to websites like\nhttp://goolti.com/\n which lists all the consultancies that most international students go to.

No country in this world has this advantage like America. Europe has many limitations for foreign workers to work for Europe and many of these country are facing huge debt, low GDP. \n\n2. America is a immigrant country. Hundreds of years ago, a group of elite come from England to persuit freedom and happiness. They build this country to let people have happy life. These people make great contribution to build this country. Legal immigrants especially for foreigners who work in technology industry are educated from American colleges.

Other countries including the United Kingdom, China, Singapore, Australia and Germany have issued policies to help international students study and work, which is the key factor, if not the most important factor for international students to consider where to study abroad. It is only to remain attractive to most talented and hard-working students around the world can US universities keep their leading positions.\n\nSecondly, US has been tagged with the most free and opening spirit since it was founded. It is the idea shared among most US citizens that people should have the same opportunity and freedom no matter where you are from, which ethnic group you belong to and what sex orientation you have. So the new OPT proposal is a good reflection of this idea.\n\nThirdly, international students have made great contributions to the US economy. Education institutions have enough money to support research, house-owners increase their income by renting their apartments, supermarkets sell more food and commodities nearby the campus. Most importantly, high-tech companies can hire most talented employees around the world, which is beneficial for the recovery of industry manufacturing and the growth of IT.\n\nFourthly, when judging whether a proposal is good or bad, it is not proper to restrict our vision to one single person. We cannot say that it's bad if I cannot get a job, or it's good if I can be employed more conveniently. The principal should be whether it's beneficial to most people concerned and good to this country. It has been proved in the history that if we can attract talented people with high-level education, we will succeed in the globalization process.

STEM majors have contributed immensely in growth and strengthening of the US economy. They have founded multiple tech companies and employed thousands of people. Most of the tech CEOs and CTOs born outside of US had entered this country as a student. Hundreds of thousands of STEM majors work all over the country in different sectors. They pay taxes, social security and medicaid, buy houses and cars, and spend to keep the economy growing.\n\n2. It is a myth that international students pay no taxes. I have been in this country for almost 6 years and have paid both federal and state taxes every year. After my fifth year, I have started paying into Social Security and Medicare as well. If 50000 international students have to leave the country when their OPT expires, that will take hundreds of million of dollars out of taxes and FICA programs. \n\n3. It is also a myth that hiring international student is cheaper. International STEM students are paid at the same rate as the US citizens for the same job, if not better. The paperwork involved in hiring international students alone make them less favorable for hiring. Also, once the employer hires an OPT student, it is likely he/she will sponsor the H1B work visa which comes with fees and even more paperwork. Therefore, it is often more expensive to hire international students. However, the only reason they get hired is that either they are very talented or no other US citizen are available to fit the role. \n\n4. I believe the new rule has enough clauses to make sure that US citizens are not replaced by international students and prevents misuse of this new rule.\n\n5. International STEM students are one of the major source of income for US universities. Each student spends about $20000 every year on average in tuition and living expenses. In absence of STEM-OPT program, the number of students choosing US for their higher studies would definitely decrease taking millions of dollars out of the university's financial resources.\n\n6. Some students, especially in graduate level, get some financial aid for work done in the college such as teaching and research. The financial aid comes from research grants and university operating budgets. The tuition and stipend benefits amount to $35000 per student on average. It makes no sense to spend so much money on an international student and only to have him/her leave the country, ultimately work in China or India and contribute to the economies of those countries.\n\n7. My final reason relates to what America and American dream stands for. America is the land of opportunity and the greatest country in the world. Immigrants are one of the reason what makes this country so great. Every international student that enters this country with the desire to achieve his/her own American dream. They assimilate with the locals and treat this country as their new home. America has always stood for justice for all, opportunity for all and I think it is very unAmerican to rob the international students of their American dream.\n\nTherefore, I urge DHS to quickly publish the final rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by P.

Here are my reasons:\n\n1. OPT and especially STEM OPT was one of the greatest driven force for me to apply to the graduate programs in US instead of anywhere else. \n\nI can imagine a lot of international students, especially STEM majored students turn to other countries for furthur study if the STEM OPT rule got cancelled. It is that simple, if there's no posibilities to gain working experience after graduation, a US degree is not necessarily competitive anymore after we go back to our home country. So there would be no point of coming to US to pursue an advanced degree anymore. In that case, a lot of laboratories and research organizations rely on graduate students will loose a lot of good resources since there will be less candidates to choose from. Which will definitely influnce research progress.\n\n2. There are tens or even hundreds of thousands of international students working in the states with STEM OPT. If the rule was denied, all the hard core technoligy firm will be the first to take a hit. They will loose a great amount of highly educated manpower in one day. And recruiting to fill the position and get new hires up to speed is definitely going to slow down their businesses. And we are talking about a LOT OF high technology companies. And that will absolutly hurt US's economy.\n\n3. US is an immigration country. It benefits from their immigration policies so much and now it is at the top of the world. The beauty of the immigration policies is that you get to select from all the great candidates from all over the world. Competition like that raises the quality of candidates that eventually get to work in the states. And US can only benefit from it.\n\n4. To turn away highly educated international students back to their country without using them to contribute to US, does not make sense to me. Especially when a lot of international students get to study here with the help of scholoships, financial assistant, working for research facilities etc. There are other countries growing stronger and bigger as we talk. Is it really a wise choice to help educate opponent's younger generation and then push them back to their home country? \n\n5. About the main concern that a lot of local STEM field workers have: that international STEM students are stealing their jobs. I DO NOT AGREE with this statement. The employer only hire internationals when they cannot find a US citizen that qualifies.\n\nFirst of all, we have a big disadvantage in language and culture. If two candidates are equaliy qualified for a job. Who would you pick? A: a native citizen understands everybody in the team and understand your culture. B: someone has to constantly ask you about the assignment content you just gave him. Second if all, same situation, but lets say the employer decides to have more diversity in his group. Then think about all the paperwork you need to go through for the international student: STEM OPT, H1B visa and even Greencard if you really decide to keep this person in the long run. That is a lot of paperwork and labor and financial cost we are talking about. \n\nThere are a lot of other aspects that OPT STEM can benefit US society.

There are way too much Americans can't afford higher education. On the other hand, the foreign students who are attracted by the chance of living and working in US pay for their own education, providing the universities with ample fund to establish more scholarships and better facilities. If the extension proposal got rejected, tons of potential international students will switch to other countries, which will be a bad thing for American education industry. And let's face it, education is everything. Apart from the education aspect, international students are bringing economic boost to American, as well as culture diversity. All of this is crucial for America's short term and long term development. \n\nSecondly, the program for opt extension is only for STEM students. These area need much more highly educated students than domestic students can provide. If the opt extension can't sustain, these tech and engineering companies will need to find more employees somehow, if they can't find them in US, they will have to open up new brach in other countries, which will further harm American's job market. To be honest, the solution for American's unemployment is not about STEM area. \n\nLast but not the least, even there are some competition between international students and domestic students, it is a fair competition, or maybe the favor is in domestic students considering all factors. Domestic students naturally has better language advantage, they don't have to worry about the VISA policy, almost everything is in their favor. International students have to overcome the culture difference and strictly follow all the rule for OPT students. Even they did everything correctly there is a chance that they can't get H1B due to the rolling mechanism. If there is only 1 year OPT, there will be no fairness at all.\n\nFor a strong and well developed country such as America, the importance of keeping good international talents coming in is very obvious. I believe whoever is making the decision will be making the right decision based on the things I mentioned above.

The reasons I came to U.S. are not only U.S. had the most advanced technology, but also U.S. had this OPT policy for me to practice what I have learned after my graduation. So I became an international student here. I have leaned knowledge from U.S university and I want to practice the knowledge I have learned in this advanced environment. Moreover, because this country gives me the knowledge I really want to learn about, I also want to do something for this country. If the OPT policy is shorten to ONLY one year, this will lower the attraction of those student who want to go to U.S. to further their studies.\n\n 2. I do think most people plan to go back to their own country after several years' working. If the OPT extension is shorten to one year, it will cause those people have a lower strength of competition when they return their country. Since the working experience is very important for employers to consider their own employees. Moreover, this will not only benefit those people who can gain their working experience, but also benefit U.S.. During the working time, they also do a strong contribution to this country, we can see the past to find out many examples.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shush Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15861", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Many STEM jobs are waiting to be fulfill, while the most qualified candidates have to leave because of their expiring legal status.

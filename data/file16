There are mainly three reasons. First, the graduated students with STEM degrees, especially those PhD degree holders, can make a lot of contribution to the economy and technology development of United States. These high educated group of people are the real talents that any countries hope to have and to employ. If US government does not allow their OPT extension, the US will lose too much. Especially, the US government has paid large amount of tuition (at least $20,ooo per year) for most of the PhD students by the research funding. If they can not continue to work in US, the government will totally lose these money. If these students go to the other countries, the US will lose more. Secondly, most of the projects in companies or in government can not be completed in only one year. If the employee with STEM degree has great performance on this project, but he/she has to stopped it, the company or the government has to recruit some other persons to replace the role of this great employee. Usually, it is hard to find someone who master the high-tech skills in a short time. Even if someone is found, the company will spend lots of money and time to re-train a new employee. I believe no company want to do like this. In order to keep the benefits of the company, especially those small high-tech start up companies, the US government should allow STEM degrees holder work for a longer time in US. Last but not the least, this rule will encourage more and more talents to come to US to contribute more to the society, otherwise, the US will lose its competitiveness to attract the talents.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0554", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We all know that diversity is very important for every organization.

The regulation is to allow STEM students (Notice, it is for STEM students, not even workers or immigrants) to expand the length of time for them to do industrial practice in US after pursuing a degree of bachelors, masters or PhD in science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nOpponents constantly claim they were victims of immigrants seeking for jobs in US, however, the regulation is for students, who potentially would be immigrants, but very probable of returning their own fast developing countries as well. In addition, foreign students disproportionately study STEM and business fields (http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/geography-of-foreign-students#/M38300). Beside business, a lot of students are studying arts, design, music who are not the target of the regulation. The students are in legal status when they stay in US, so this regulation has nothing to do with the debates of illegal immigrants taking US jobs. \n\nDespite some opponents' personal difficulties, biases or misunderstandings of the regulation, intended or unintended, this regulation is beneficial to many fields, industries and institutions a lot. It is a very simple logic that anyone can follow immediately. First of all, if any markets were to maintain a healthy, if any economy were to pursuing growth, the fair competition is the foundation. Eliminating the possibility of foreign students to work in US, would make the job market has less competitors and therefore decrease the vitality of the STEM companies, who in the end have to hire more and pay more to unqualified workers to remain competitive in international market. Once companies cannot afford this, the companies die and the jobs would disappear. \n\nOn the other hand, all companies that support foreign students with OPT stem, they have to pay for it. Each company, other than the payroll, have to pay for each foreign student they hire. If it true, according to some opponents of this regulation, that US has enough qualified STEM workers, why would US companies choose to spend extra to hire foreign students? Here the opponents is trying to mislead the public by mixing the H-1B quotas being used by some contractor companies with OPT STEM Extension, however, H1B is not directly related to this regulation and congress is investigating and limiting the H1B fraud.\n\nIt is clear that STEM companies need to expand, and they choose to expand with some foreign student workforces who usually carry a Masters or PhD degree beside hiring qualified Americans. They have to do this due to the shortage of local talents and willing to provide good practice opportunities to the students who just finished school. Once the STEM companies managed to grow and expand, they would pay more taxes (which could be used in US education, US medicare, military etc.), they would create more job opportunities (not only to foreign students, but more important, to US citizens.), they could manage to decrease the prices of a lot things because better technologies are invented. It is undoubtably clear that the regulation would generate way more benefits to the nation compared to the short-termed pain of some unqualified individuals who only blames more qualified competitors taking away their opportunities of getting paid for underperforming.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiao Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16838", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the rules of expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.\n\nFirst of all, America put a lot of efforts in educating STEM students, who should service America after they get the degree.

Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students?

Therefore, many companies in U.S strongly prefer equally skilled Americans based on the language and culture backgrounds. However, why do we still see a lot of foreigners working in the US companies today and even they need the visa sponsorship? The reason is simple and straightforward.

This is a very good policy which attracts the most talented students from all over the world to the U.S. Imagine that if students know that they cannot have a chance to practice what they've learned and researched in the country, why do they want to even select the U.S. to advance their studies. The U.S. would lose the best students which could potentially become research leaders in many important areas. Remember that attracting best people from the world has made the U.S. one of the best countries in the world. \n\nOn the other hand, for those who have spent years in study in the U.S., many professors in prestigious institutions spent years mentoring and training the students. As far as I know, the top tier universities require at minimum 5-7 years to train a ph.d student. When they graduate, they will be kicked out of the country. This is a HUGE waste in time of those professors, in educational resources of schools and in fundings such as NFS. I don't understand the rational why the U.S. wants to spend so much and finally prepare excellent researchers/scientists/engineers for other countries. \n\nI think this rule definitely makes a multiple-win outcome. It benefits researchers/professors, as they would be able to hire high quality students. It benefits students, as they would be able to use what they learned after graduations. It benefits academia/industries, as they get the well trained students/employees which can do nothing but good to the fields. I also understand that the rule seemingly hurts the right of American, mostly likely American students (considering those who competes with OPT holders).

In any field, when a student starts his optional practical training, it will take time for him to understand the complete picture of the company and most importantly in majority of the jobs, employers won't be willing to grant students access to systems and servers worth millions of dollars whereas if the same student spends about two years as a fresher and other two years with full access to everything in a company then that reflects the true meaning of OPT. The student then gets the actual practical training which will surely help him/her in future.

If U.S. closes its door for highly-skilled international student graduates to work legally in the U.S., thus driving them back to their home countries, U.S. is only training highly educated people for other countries rather than for itself. While it's of high nobility that U.S. is sharing its one-of-a-kind education to the world, in the long run it does no good to the economy and society development of the United States.\n\n2. Many international students who stayed in the U.S. actually contributed to the growth and the leadership status of U.S.. Simply take Sundar Pichai for example. He has became the most well-known international entity who directs the most well-known U.S. company in the world--Google. He led the development of Google Chrome web browser, which accounts for 58% worldwide market share in the web browser market. International students like him have helped keep U.S. companies stay top-notch among worldwide competitors. The U.S. economy benefits from such leadership.\n\n3. Competition exists everywhere, and it's not a bad thing. Talented American workers will always get noticed and hired. In fact, American workers can do a lot more with their citizenships, such as working part-time jobs without restrictions, or establish startups without undermining student status. The current way international students are regulated actually ensures that the international student graduates are indeed highly skilled, since they cannot do anything else other than getting well-trained. By allowing them to work legally in the U.S. will ensure that American companies always have a higher chance of hiring top-notch people. U.S. economy will walk on a wide and well-paved road supported by the entire world's most talented people. On the other hand, they might ended up hiring sub-par candidates in the economy where not enough skilled workers who met their hiring requirement are available. If this happens, as a result, U.S. economy will end up walking on a tightrope, where the tightrope is supported by the most talented American workers, and thin air beside it by those self-claimed qualified workers. If U.S. economy can walk on a well-paved road, why should it walk on a tightrope? If U.S. economy collapses somehow while on the tightrope, how would it benefit American workers?", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shen Tain", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20514", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "American graduates are having a difficult time finding work now.

Statistics shown that on average over 18% of the total students are international students nowadays in America. This number of portion is even much higher in graduate schools and research institutions. Students from other countries choose to study in U.S not only for the high quality of courses, but also value the great amount of opportunities in industry, which would provide tons of practical training since U.S has the worlds' most competitive corporations and companies with advanced technology. Students would gain extensive industry experience by doing internships and full-time jobs with OPT, which makes a huge difference comparing to go to a university from another country like U.K and China. However, U.S universities will definitely lose its attraction to the most talented people around the world if U.S would throw them out immediately when they get their degree. On the long run, the U.S universities will not stay at the top of the world.\n\nOn the other side, U.S corporations and companies would gain more if this proposal becomes effective. The reason that U.S has the world's most cutting edge technology and still leading the innovation is that the world's smartest and most hard working people are coming to this country and bring their new ideas to this country. In an era when almost every people on earth is connected through the Internet, U.S corporations cannot survive if they only focus on the U.S market but ignore the rest of the world. Companies like Google, Facebook, Apple would by no means be such successful if they do not provide their service and sell their products to the fast growing economies like China and India. With such need, international students who are familiar with their motherland culture as well as educated by U.S educational systems are the perfect choices for the U.S companies to expand their products to other parts of the world. By not providing the working opportunities to international students after graduation would bring huge negative impact to the U.S corporations and hurt U.S economy both in the short term and long term. \n\nLast by not least, providing 24 more months of extension to STEM students is pivot and would bring much more benefit to U.S economy than providing only 12 months with no extension. Companies would need to hold more interviews, go through more process and spend more money to find a replacement on the job market where today there are less supply than demand already if the student has to be expelled out of the country only in 12 months.  \n\nTo summary, this proposal needs to pass and becomes effective, otherwise both U.S and American people are losing in today's competitive world. \n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Hongjiang Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17569", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional.

I am a recently graduated Business Analytics master student from China. Currently I am doing an internship as a Business Analyst Intern at DHL Express. \nI have been in America for three years and I still remember the day I decided to pursue this masters program. I had the chance to choose three masters programs in the US, Canada or England. But I finally made my decision to go to America. Aside from the fact that I admired American culture and education system, the most important reason for my decision would be the Training Opportunities provided during school and post-graduation. The masters major I was interested in requires more than only theoretical knowledge. Business Analytics needs actual practice to master. With many of my close friends who are in other STEM majors, I am confident to say that all STEM majors requires training and working outside of school. I'm sure this is one of the reasons for the original 17-month extension. With this hugely beneficial OPT policy, America has become the most attractive country for foreign students who want to a STEM major and really master their crafts. If the policy were to be canceled (which I sincerely hope not), America lose its charm towards foreign talents. It'll also be a huge loss for many great American companies like Facebook, Apple etc.\nI understand that many Americans are afraid of foreign students taking Americans' jobs. I do believe there's nothing to worry about. First of all, the DHS initiated the e-verify program. Only companies that are in the program can take in OPT extension students. The e-verify program states that all job seekers should be treated equally when applying for jobs. The e-verify program insures that international students( who are in many ways the vulnerable group in the job market) should not be discriminated against. But it also insures that Americans should not be discriminated against either. Another issue that bothers people who are against the OPT extension is that the lower pay granted for international students makes it harder for Americans to find a job. This is not a valid point. OPT students technically are \"in training\", which is like doing an internship. It's only natural that interns get lower pays than full-time employees.I believe even American interns get lower pays. If people who seek full-time employment are afraid that internships' lower payment will damage their opportunities in the job market, then they should be demanding higher payments for internships rather than protesting against OPT extensions. \nFinally, like many friends of mine, I intend to return to China eventually. Even if America is the land of opportunities as many have said, it is not a home for me. I have learned much from my US university, but my native knowledge and experience in China makes it only reasonable for me to return to China and utilize my skills. However, the world is more increasingly becoming a global market. Only with experience and knowledge from multiple cultures can a person thrive in this world. It is not logical to go back home immediately after graduation without applying the skills I learned in America in an American setting. Plus, it could really benefit me when I go back to China with a masters degree and three years of working experience in the US.\nTo conclude, I sincerely believe that the OPT extension will benefit me, my friends, and most importantly, America.

The only opinions you should consider are those of Americans.\nHere are some of the reasons I oppose this extension:\n- A person with a Bachelors degree, or higher, does not NEED training! They've had their training already, and only need to adapt themselves to the work environment of the company that hires them. An F-1 student should be encouraged to leave the country upon graduation while their skills are still fresh and they can do the most good for their home country.\n- American STEM graduates can't find jobs in STEM fields. Why? Because companies do not have to pay SocSec and Medicare taxes for OPT employees. This translates to a defacto subsidy for employers who hire OPT workers. Thus, it is easier for an OPT student to find a job in his or her chosen field than it is for a native born American.\n- There is no shortage of STEM workers in America. I have been involved in IT since the late 1970's and I can state that there never was a shortage. There is, in fact, a surplus of qualified Americans who are willing and able to do these jobs. If there was a true shortage, wages would be rising in the STEM fields at a rate higher than that found in other fields. That simply is not happening. Why? Because the government has made it easy for companies to bring in foreign workers at a lower cost. It has also allowed companies to hire fresh employees with the latest skills rather than train existing employees. If you are of the opinion that older STEM workers just can't learn the new technologies, I ask you to look at the ages of those who actually 'developed' these new technologies. You will find that many were over 40.\n- Lastly, STEM workers have a double job. We have to be effective with current technology while also devoting time and resources to learning new technologies. The good thing is that most of us enjoy doing just that. Once a gearhead, always a gearhead. The OPT program, by flooding the job market with cheap employees, makes it more difficult for American STEM workers at all levels to maintain employment.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nAt what point are the representatives we send to Washington, D.C. actually going to represent us?

It is absurd and absolutely unfair to give this conclusion. Positively, half of OPT students can finally end up with a internship or a full-time position. The most of a half is leaving USA. Little among this figure is able to convert to other working visas, only a few of employers have the ability to sponsor H1B. Even much less of the rate to luckily get the visa from a pool of lottery!

What's the unfair thing is the students as tax payers, but DO NOT enjoy the service from the society as the tax payer mostly. They pay for the poor people as basic standard life support!

They contributed their knowledge and intelligence to the development of this country, and they are paid at what they deserved. Therefore, Visa and Identity in US should be the least factor that block this group staying in US and make contribution. \n\nSecond, personally speaking, I graduated from Duke University and got Master's degree.

First of all, many colleges and Universities are not doing that well financially, it is the growing international student population who doesn't get much financial aid/scholarship from the school and paying their tuition in full that are supporting the financial health of these schools. At the same time, because of the international student population is growing exponentially, the related industries that's in your day to day life had benefitted hugely- renting, food, retail, etc. Honestly the immigration regulation of the United States sucks comparing to a lot of other well developed countries. It cannot compare with Canada, Britain, or Australia at all. However, the reason why people still keeps coming is because they see the effort the U.S. government has trying to make. They see that U.S. government realized that they can't let the talented and skilled people learn the top skills in the world and leave the country without serving the companies of its own just because of the limitation from immigration rules. This new regulation is going to keep more people in the United States and keep the technology firms working healthily. On the opposite, if this regulation doesn't pass, many people will have to leave the country and the technology firms won't have enough people to support the work they're doing now. Lack of good regulation will also stop people from coming into this country because why not choose other countries where they could've easily stayed.\n\nFor those people who are arguing immigrations are causing lowered wage without any proof- just because you can't find a well-paid job doesn't mean fewer incoming immigrants is going to solve this. You can't find a well-paid job because you're not qualified and not capable. Most of the international students who benefit from this new regulation will easily make over 80k per year and help the company create way more revenue and profit. If you are calling that lowering the minimum wage, I guess I have nothing to say about your Intelligence Quotient. Even if the international students leave the country, you are still not going to be the one who gets that job because no company will pay that salary to someone who doesn't deserve it. You know what will happen when those companies really lose those talents? They're going to move their companies to Asia where they can easily hire more talented people for half of the price. And you are still here struggling to find a job. When this country doesn't thrive for high talented employees anymore, that's when the minimum wage will really suffer. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe this is a good regulation that is indeed going to help both the international students and U.S. Citizens. If these talented students need to leave just because they don't have working authorization, that's a true loss to the country and that's what's really going to cause this country issues.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lily Yang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15841", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Once again the American desiring employment is pushed aside for the more desirable foreigner who will work for less money.

Three years is a reasonable period because we can expect students to learn the ropes of their profession during the 1st year, then, as a mechanism to compensate employers for participating in this program, allow them to participate in meaningful projects for the next two years. Indeed, calls to extend the program duration are not unfounded because some industries e.g. pharmaceutical have long Research and Development (R&D) cycles and it is to the benefit of both the student and company for the same student to be involved in the entire R&D cycle.\n\nThe American education industry will benefit because this program will help persuade foreign students to pursue higher education in America. The fact of the matter is that the top universities in Canada and UK are just as good as the top universities in the US. However, none of these countries have a program similar to OPT. As such, foreign students who are undecided between pursuing an enginerring degree at MIT or Imperial College London will likely choose the former as it offers these students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they have learned without too much bureaucratic hassle. The fact that they can use the income they earned from their job to pay off their student debt is merely icing on the cake.\n\nThe benefit to the American economy as a whole is a little bit harder to see. I would argue that the American economy will benefit from this program due to its potential to attract students who may turn out to be superstars in their field of study and go on to produce novel inventions or build large multinational corporations, thus raising the standard of living and creating jobs for Americans. For example, if Americans were hostile to foreign workers, then people like Andrew Ng, Sebastian Thrun, Sergey Brin and Satya Nadella will certainly eschew migrating here.\n\nLet me conclude my comment by offering a rebuttal to the common reasons cited in opposition to this rule:\n\n1.\tOPT is a backdoor  to H1B\n\nI am not familiar with the intent and mechanics of the H1B visa program. However, I do find the actions of Disney and Edison with regards to their decision to replace their American workers with cheaper foreign workers on H1B visas deplorable. Nevertheless, I think discussing how OPT affects H1B visas is misguided because OPT should be judged on its ability to effectively and efficiently provide an opportunity for foreign students to apply the knowledge they have gained in their field of study.\n\n2.\tOPT will displace American STEM workers\n\nAssuming effective regulation and oversight, it is hard to see why an American company will prefer to hire F-1 students/graduates over local American graduates (too much paperwork).   \n\nIt is imperative that procedures and policies are to put in place to prevent businesses from exploiting workers in the OPT program. For example, an oft cited reason that employers prefer OPT workers is that they are able to pay these workers below the 'prevailing wage'. To remedy this situation, I propose that the 'prevailing wage' be determined by taking into account the supply of American workers and expected number foreign workers and be offered to any applicant. That way, this will prevent companies from favouring OPT workers solely for financial reasons. People need to realise that simply being an American in possession of a STEM degree does not entitle you to a job. Work ethic, soft skills, work experience and leadership skills are some of the significant factors that determine a candidate's suitability to a particular job. \n\nAnother common gripe against this program is that people in this program do not have to pay Social Security and Medicare. This is not entirely true because students who are resident aliens for tax purposes do have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes! The fact that most OPT workers do not pay these taxes is due to them not being in the US long enough to qualify as a resident alien. If the general public finds this situation abhorrent, then a tax reform is needed. To shut down the OPT program on this basis is misguided.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fredrick Stout", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4402", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this proposal!!\nI am a small business owner and I have a grocery store and a restaurent near the University of Southern California campus. \n99% of my customers are international students and my life gets better because of them.

So, in order to achieve this macro-strategical target, the people who major in STEM fields are urgently needed. Only by extending OPT, more opportunities can be created for nonimmigrant STEM graduates who are utterly capable of making a real difference to the rapid economic recovery of the U.S. As a result, the other aspects of the society would get benefits on that, which in turns means more jobs and more likely people would have sufficient money to spend on not only their living necessities but also life supplementary products. In the end, this would become a good cycle to incentive the macro-economy of the U.S. \n\nAlso, the fast development of technology and science is highly dependent of as many highly educated intelligences as possible. If the OPT extension was cancelled, the direct consequence would be immediate loss of hundreds of thousands of educated workers in the U.S., not mentioning the fact that their spouses would have no choice but also to leave the country even though they have already been granted with proper working visas. And the worse thing is that as long as those who are looking for further education opportunities in the U.S. knew the revocation of OPT extension regulation, they may have to go for the alternative plan because it's highly likely that after graduation they may not have enough time to find appropriate jobs so as to come back to their mother country without being competitive to the local peer graduates. \n\nBy adding theses two up, the number is gonna to be quite big and the U.S. would have to pay for the consequence for decades. Therefore, the OPT extension proposal is exactly a good answer to largely ameliorating the current economical situation of the U.S. \n\nOn the other hand, many opposite voices have been heard in public against this proposal for several reasons. I think the core reason is simply that these people who voted \"no\" just want to lower the competition in find jobs as they know the advantages are not on their side. However, this is absolutely bad thing for the whole country because even a 5-year-old kid knows that no competition thus no promotion.

First, the enhanced post-graduate training benefits for F1 visa holders will help American Universities to attract the needed capital and top talents from all over the world and retain their leading positions. This will benefit local/American students by providing them with a multi-cultural study environment, even better academic resources and financial aid opportunities. Second, this new rule will help STEM graduate students better focus on their jobs/functionalities in critical positions where there is a labor shortage of qualified local/American students. The reality is American companies are very unwilling (as they should be) to hire foreign students unless they absolutely have to, because of the complicated procedure and high cost. If a STEM student without a long-term stay promise (OPT is temporary) is hired for a position, it is more than likely a position where there are not many qualified American students available in that specific area. Filling this type of positions can make US economy stronger and create more jobs for American students who are qualified in other areas. \n\nIn all, I hope this new rule will take effect as soon as possible to benefit US universities, US workers and US economy.

They need to be able to learn fast, they need to have good physiological quality, and of course, they need to be talented to get a nice GPA. They are qualified to work in the US and they can contribute a lot to the development of STEM in USA. \n\nSecond, it is American spirit to give everyone on this land equal rights to compete with each other. Those talented international students who come to the US deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.\n\nThird, STEM OPT extension will benefit a lot to US education and economy. If this policy cannot be supported, the US will not be as attractive as it was to international students in STEM areas. Talented students may want to stay in their own country or go to other countries to find opportunities since it will be too hard for them to find a working opportunity after graduation. Therefore, this policy is good for improving US education and attracting students to the US. Moreover, those talented STEM students will be able to improve US economy a lot. We cannot ignore the fact that some international students are very talented in STEM areas. For example, their are more international students from various countries than US students in the CS (computer science) PhD program and many other engineering PhD program in my school. If the extension policy cannot pass, I believe most of these students will go back to their own country to find positions. This is a BIG loss for US economy. Actually this leads to my final point.\n\nFinally, taking PhD students into consideration, STEM OPT extension policy is very powerful in maintaining the world's first position of America in Science and Technology fields!! A large number of PhD candidates in the US are international students. Those PhD students are high-end talents that are very attractive to all the countries in the world. As far as I know, there are a lot of new policies benefits those PhD students who go back to their home country after studying abroad. How could America compete with other countries in getting those high-ends talents? It is US that spend tons of money in educating these fellows. In my own case, I am a PhD candidate majoring Biology. I receive fellowship every year and that is enough for my personal life. I am working in a lab and using expensive microscopies and chemical drugs. I know the money I spent comes from US tax-payers. If it is possible, I am more than happy to find a job opportunity in the US and work for United States. There are thousands and millions international PhD students like me studying in the US.

For the reason that majority of jobs request applicants to be eligible to work in U.S. without sponsorship, which means only a small portion of jobs accept nonimmigrant students to apply. That is to say, only a small portion of jobs could be shared between nonimmigrant students and American residents.  And for those small portions of jobs, if an enterprise hires nonimmigrant students, the company has to help those nonimmigrant students to apply for their H1B.  In this case, most enterprises will be more willing to hire Americans instead of nonimmigrant students if possible.  In conclusion, the jobs shared to nonimmigrant students are the ones that many Americans are not willing to do or not capable to do well compared to nonimmigrant students.  \nAnd this is true in reality and that is why this OPT extension only works for those nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.  These STEM related jobs require more perspiration and efforts that nonimmigrant students would like to sacrifice for U.S. companies.  Of course there are a lot of Americans who also have talent and would like to work hard for these kinds of jobs, and it is sure that they are hired, because as I mentioned above, companies would like hire Americans rather than nonimmigrant students who require sponsorship in order to work in U.S.  That is to say, nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees will only work in industries where Americans are not competitive as nonimmigrant students, which lead to my send reason to support this rule.\nShould U.S. kick out talented nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees after they graduated?  This OPT extension rule does not apply to those mediocre nonimmigrant students who does not have the ability to find a job in U.S. This rule is applied to those talented nonimmigrant students with STEM degree who are not that lucky for their H1B visas.  U.S. industries related to STEM need talented foreign students who can share their knowledge, and there are one more thing need to be claimed clearly: these students are working for U.S. industries; they are bringing wealth to U.S. society.  There is one more thing, which is my third reason, need to be mentioned regard the wealth they have brought to U.S. society: the large amount of tuition they have already paid to U.S. universities.  \nThink about how those huge amounts of tuition has helped U.S. universities about their research funding.  If the rule has passed, U.S. will definitely attract more nonimmigrant students with STEM majors to come to U.S. and study.  In this case, U.S. universities can continue benefit from their tuition and U.S. STEM industries con continue benefit from the join of those talented students.  \nIn the final analysis, given the reasons mentioned above, it is safely come to the conclusion that this rule should be passed.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anan He", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22207", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The US has always been a land of immigrants that offers equal opportunity to the everyone who is willing to work hard and follow the rules.

We can even draw a conclusion that because of many bright foreign workers, US tech companies are still in a leading place in the world. It's a big loss for those tech companies if many of those trained sophisticated tech workers are forced to get back home just because they can't get h1b visas. So extension of the STEM OPT which grant one more chance for STEM students to take the h1b lottery meet the best interest of the US tech industries. Remember, tech industries do not only provide job opportunities to foreign workers, tech companies provide many service jobs to local work force market too, and only if those tech companies keep competetive and profitable, will all the supporting jobs surrounding them be profitable. \n    History has told us that avoid competition has always been a terrible idea in all aspects. What happened to all those car companies in Detroit? Blocking out all those bright people and give those jobs to us citizens does not protect their jobs in the end. Since all those sophisticated workers will go back home and work for the local companies and make them competitive, then the jobs grabbed from foreign workers would be cut out and lost forever. Keep open to competitions in all aspects is the only way for any country to survive in nowadays, especially for United States since the gap between US and competitors has narrowed pretty much recent years. It's the equal chance in hiring process that need to be concerned, as for that aspect, we can still see advantages for us citizens over foreign workers.\n    What's more, shutting up the gate to foreigners is a betrayal to the essential spirit which defined United States. It's the foreign scholars who came to US made it a great place for science and won the WW2. All Americans are initially foreigners at the beginning, it's because of the same belif that bond them together and hence this country is founded.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n.\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n.\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n. 1point3acres.com/bbs\nAdmitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Hua Zhao, Northeastern University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13179", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new proposal and I think it would be worthwhile for both U.S. citizens and international students if this proposal is implemented.

The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.  \n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.

First, the new proposed regulation still requires that the company should not reduce the number of hired US workers as the result of hiring F1 students. So the existing jobs available to US workers are secured. Second, the regulation also states that the hired F1 students should be paid equally to the US workers, so the claim that the OPT program will reduce the average salary of US tech workers is unsound. Third, if there were no OPT extension program, the working forces in the science and technology area will greatly shrink. As a result, the number of product produced by the hi-tech industry will decrease and the cost will increase. The outcome would be the loss of competitiveness of US companies in the global market, which will eventually lower the average welfare of US tech workers and harm the overall economy of US.\n\nOPT extension program gives US a strong power to keep the most intelligent students around the world to work for US. Without such a program more than 80% of the PhD students who are from foreign countries will have to leave US and the loss to US as a whole due to the lack of skilled researchers will be immense.

I graduate from Columbia University. I was in the engineering school. I am now hired and working with the status of OPT. I am very clear how OPT benefits me and my company, broadly the technology industries, my schools and even USA economics. \n\nInternational students are contributing significantly to the technology industries. We graduated from top universities and colleges and have abilities and capabilities to perform well and work diligently on the positions. Great leaderships, such as CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai and CEO of Microsoft, Satya Narayana Nadella, CEO of PepsiCo and CEO of MasterCard, are leads people changing the world, making a better day for all of us. They were all on the same road as current international students, we are. Today, we, like them, need OPT extensions to become great people. We all believe in America. America gives opportunities for people from different races and countries, to make it more beautiful, more comfortable and advanced on the top of world not only in technologies but also globalization. \n\nOPT and OPT STEM extensions can certainly benefit colleges and universities. There are hundreds of thousands of international students in USA. The tuitions and living costs is a significant amount of money to schools. 50 thousand dollars tuition and living cost is an understatement for each student each year, not saying cost spending before coming to USA, such as taking tests, applications and transportations. It is beneficial to school and the country. I would say studying in USA is much more difficult than in other counties, in terms of spending and academic requirements. But why we do that? Apart from schools are famous, but OPT provides the opportunities for enrich our working experience aboard, full-time or internships. In fact, compared with native students, we are much harder to find a job. Our application fields are really narrowed. On the other hand, many famous professors were once international students. They use OPT or OPT extensions for their first occupation. In the academic worlds, famous professors enhance schools' academic influence. I have taken 10 courses at Columbia and only 2 among 10 professors are native Americans. (3 Indians, 1 Greek, 1 Italian, 1 German, 1 Chinese, 1 Korean). I would say 1> this fields may not be a popular one for native people; 2> the professors from other countries originally are famous and competitive in the world of academics.\n\nJust as I said, I do not think at all OPT STEM extension to 24 months will become an obstacle for local people. OPT constrained the job seeking area for international students. It requires the students to be hired only in the area of their majors. All companies able to hire them, especially those are E-verify (support OPT extension), need to access a database system of USCIS for verification of applicability for their majors to the job positions. Most STEM areas are not popular among native people, but the industries have a good amount of employments. In my major EE, students taking the same track of courses are overwhelmingly international students. The ratio is about 85%. As I said previously, the rate of my professors for internationally are 80%. Engineering studies are hard, timing consuming and energy consuming. We have spent much more time than the local students, to learn and perform well. This major is more suitable for us, who do not have so many recreation activities and big friend networks in USA. As well, let's look at the top majors for USA colleges (data sourced from College Factual), History, English Language and Literature, Accounting, Teacher Education, Nursing, Psychology and Business.... None of them is in STEM area. \n\nEven in STEM areas, most job positions are not applicable for international students. For example, in my area, circuits design. Most applicable positions are not for NCGs. Few available positions for NCGs requires citizenship or green card status. The reason is positions in the area are involved confidential such as military technologies. I have similar experiences, if you open LinkedIn search for Circuit Design or FPGA positions, you would see international students do not have many opportunities, not saying we have language and culture weak points.

E-verify program ensures that no international student will take advantage of low payment. \n\nYES, OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation.

If there is no opt extension, this great guys will leave after one year in these companies. This will be a great lose of that big names. As we know most companies will have nearly one year training.

However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff (cont.):\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:\n\n\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\nAnd finally:\n\"One of the big education pushes in the United States is to increase STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education and create a workforce better suited to the jobs available in the modern era. Even schools that are not dedicated STEM schools are pushed to increase their STEM education, and other communities have gotten together to create STEM initiatives to supplement education.\"\nBut DHS' proposed rule \"is pushing the ones raised and trained at home out of the job market that we created these education initiatives for and handing those jobs to students who have no ties to the U.S. other than their education.\"\n\nThis idea should be dead on arrival.\nSincerely,\nWalter Babigian ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Walter Babigian", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3687", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Why does the Homeland Security Department think that is has the Constitutional authority to write immigration legislation?\n\nBecause that is what the change in 'policy' will do.\n\nThis change will effectively increase the number of foreign workers allowed in the US well past existing legislative limits.\n\nCongress has the authority to make any change in immigration numbers - not nameless bureaucrats.\n\nWith our current surplus of STEM workers why would the government increase competition for scarce STEM jobs?\n\nIf you want to argue and increase legal immigration - let the Congress conduct hearings and if it passes so be it, don't shove it through via executive fiat.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Robert Consorti", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4221", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think US need the stem student to stay here.

A foreign candidate proven language proficiency, education, and professional experience, can stay in Australia for 5 years without firm sponsorship, during which she or he could apply for Australian Citizenship after the 4th year - which comes with enormous social benefits.\n\nI hope U.S. will do well in economy, and make the decision to retain foreign talents using its best efforts.

The definition of similarly situated ensures that no foreign students meet the criteria.  If all foreign students meet STEM OPT requirements, they can be hired to replace American workers without any employer liability.  Therefore, in reality no American STEM workers are protected by this regulation.\n\nWhy does the Regulation rely on just a word description of similarly situated as the key means for protecting American workers?  Given the need to really protect our workers a list of examples is needed to provide a uniform understanding of the term.  DHS should be charged with developing and maintaining this list subject to the oversight and approval of a qualified third party such as the Department of Labor.  Additions to the initial list must come from actual experience over time with the STEM OPT program.  Each example should be rated on a credibility scale for accuracy and relevance and this rating updated every year.\n\nThe Regulation allows an employer to use other means than their actual pay scales to show how and what they value as competent work.  Instead, they may use local associations, or national and local wage surveys to set compensation for their STEM OPT foreign students. \n\nThe Regulation leaves it to the employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for STEM OPT foreign students. What is the incentive for any business to take on a mentoring and training program?  What objectives are to be met, and how is effective training to be completed and reported?\n\nThe Regulation lacks details on how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. STEM workers with STEM OPT foreign students. Instead, the Regulation leaves it to the employer. How can DHS have a uniform means to administer and met goals and objectives for STEM OPT?  If compliance can not be measured, then how can the employer be liable for violations?\n\nSTEM OPT foreign students are characterized by the Regulation as having contradictory skills and needs.  They are described as high skilled STEM OPT students.  However, they also require mentoring and training.  In addition, they need experience.  This gives credence to the reality of making low cost foreign workers available to employers without using the H-1B program cap. \n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama) had concerns about administratively using the STEM OPT program to establish a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.  The Regulation does this by making all STEM OPT foreign student eligible for replacing American workers.  American workers are not protected.\n\nWhy is the Regulations not \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"  Have the GAO findings and recommendations been addressed?  Is the DHS the right choice for oversight and administration?\n\nThe March 2014 GAO report also identified \". a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, concurred with the GAO recommendations and was working on them. What is the status of each GAO recommendation about the lack of security?\n\nIs STEM OPT meant to be a temporary training program? Is it being used as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans?\n\nAre the mentoring program benefits for foreign graduates under STEM OPT available to American graduates?\n\nWhy are employers given a substantial bonus ($10K and up) for hiring a foreign college grad rather than an American College grad with the same skills?  \n\nThis Regulation defines a recent college grad as a student.  Therefore, what is done about payroll taxes? What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Stephen Weatherly", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4059", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "American economic growth relies on high-tech industries, and they need foreign students with STEM degrees as employees.

My reasoning is not just from personal experience, but also, in the consideration of what would this rule benefit United States in long run.\n\nAs a graduate biostatistics student, it's NOT at all easy to find a job in United States for a fresh graduated foreign student, I am confident about saying this because I've been through all these. If you go to a job fair held in university, some companies would tell you directly that they are not hiring F-1 students. Phone interviews for F-1 students most commonly begins with 'Do you need sponsorship to work in US?' for most companies are not willing to put in money and effort to help F-1 students to obtain H1B, and would rather hire somebody that are more stable and more easily blend in. In addition, as the H1B policy has becoming striker and striker over the years, most F-1 students are just working through the OPT period and leave US, so its not convincing to accuse that foreign students are stealing jobs from US citizens.\n\nWith this inevitable obstacle we are having finding a job in US, only the best of the best foreign students would be able to find a job, and the luckiest ones among them are able to stay in US. It's reasonable for those those good students to learn from the industry in US, and by learning, they are actually making money for US companies.\n\nWe all know that the most beneficial part for this rule approved is not F-1 students, for only those are able to find a job can actually using OPT, but the US companies would benefit a lot if this rule approved. For huge international company, they need more divers culture in the company so as to open the market across different countries and again, they are able to hold on to the best foreign students for a longer time period.

The OPT offers international students opportunities to master knowledge they learned from school. It significantly benefits international student no matter where they begin their career in the future. Different from Humanities, STEM students will gain better understanding through their training. People should take OPT as a part of education for international students rather than jobs. Generally, STEM relevant training programs will run from 24 to 36 months. Students are able to gain better understanding of their knowledge by completing entire training programs. The standard OPT is unable to allow international students complete the entire program. For students, they lose opportunities to complete the whole education program if they do not have extended OPT. For the organizations where students study, they have to increase the cost to find new people to complete the program and invest more in new coming student if the OPT cannot be extended. As a part of American advanced education, OPT offers students to complete their program better, which is compatible to the philosophy of America: Pragmatism.\nSince extended OPT significantly improve the quality of American advanced level education, it is attractive to international students. International students spend over 26.8 billion dollars in the United States in 2014. It means that international students have been contributing to Economy of the United States. The regular OPT significantly diminishes the attraction of American education to international students. Canada, the United Kingdom and even Hong Kong are offering better opportunities to international students in similar program like OPT. Hong Kong and Canada even offer better opportunities to international students with easier immigrant processes. Anti-immigrant organizations must realize the philosophy of extended OPT is not standard job. It is a part of education which offers STEM international students to complete their education and learn better. The extended OPT makes American education more attractive to international students than other countries. If the extended OPT is cancelled, the quality of American advanced level education will decrease to international students. It also diminishes the attraction to STEM international students. It may lead less international students choose America as their destination. The potential damage is the United States loss partial economic benefits from international students. \nSTEM international students need extended OPT for education not for taking jobs from Americans. International students with experiences are more competitive when returning to their home countries; therefore, OPT extension is increasing the quality and attraction of American advanced level education. Maintaining the quality and attraction of American education can keep the contribution from international students to American economy.

I know people who made massive student loans. And their plan is to repay the loan in two or three years by earning the money in dollars. If the OPT stem extension was vacated their situation would be miserable. They are smart enough to get a job in their home countries if they are sent back. But repaying the loan amount would take decades. In future, this would discourage many smart students to pursue higher education in USA. This can affect US universities economically and gradually decrease the diversity of US universities.\n\nI don't see a point in vacating OPT extension, if it was to provide more opportunities to US citizens: \n\n1. The Big companies that have branches across world: They hire based on a person's talent and skills regardless of citizenship and immigration status. If they have a foreign student on 12-month OPT, rather than losing the resource due to immigration issue, the company would offer an opportunity for the same candidate offshore. This will not necessarily create new opportunities with in USA. Instead it will create a brain-drain (Skilled students will be sent away). \n\n2. Companies that are growing and don't have branches across the world: They do hire foreign students, considering the probability of getting a H1 they hire foreign students in a small percentage to avoid sudden loss of large number of employees.\n\n3. There are many small companies and start-ups that do not hire foreign students to avoid extra work. During my job search, I came across many such companies. I always wanted to work for a start-up, it disappointed me that many companies did not consider me due to my immigration status. \n\nSo I would say, US citizens have more opportunities and have higher probability of getting a job than an immigrant.

I am a international student from China, majoring at Geographical Information Science. At that time, I received offers for Master program from some world famous universities, such as University of Toronto in Canada, HongKong  University, and also University of Michigan in U.S. All of these schools offer great education. And HKU also offer me academic awards. But I finally choose to come to America, for it offers international students enough OPT time to cast knowledge into real-world practice. If the OPT extension is cancelled, we lost a lot of opportunities to earn real-world experience. If so, I believe, many students like me would not choose America for further education, but would like to go countries like England, Canada, Australia and Singapore, who are now actively attracting international students. So OPT and its extension is a pretty significant attraction of education institutions of America. Also, as is known to all, there are a lot of excellent STEM students from international. Attracting good students to America do promote its academics. Declining the extension means America education institutions will lose a lot smart brains and also revenue.\n\nIn addition, many e-verified companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft have involved a lot of excellent international students. If OPT extension cancelled, many of them will have to leave the companies, which will definitely have great negative effect of those companies. Some people may argue that OPT extension decreases employment rate of America because international students capture a lot of positions. However, it has to be cleared that, international students compete fairly with all America residents. Most of time it is more competitive for us, because we have to be very good to convince the company that it is worth to employ me, a non-resident, than a resident, even it takes more complicated processes and money to deal with International Visa issues. You know, it is never easy for international students to get an opportunity, even for internship and fellowship. So, from some aspect, it is really fair to have OPT extension. Even it does exist job competitions, it simulates U.S. residents to learn more hard and be better, which in another way promote the development of America.\n\nFinally, as OPT extension attracts more international students and they can stay longer in America, restaurants have more costumers, uber drivers have more earnings, shopping centers sales more, and also many residents can have more income by renting their house out to those students. I think there are a lot more really examples that prove OPT extension do benefits America economy and its residents.\n\nOverall, I do believe the new 24 OPT extension proposal is requisiteand will be beneficial.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wei Ying ", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7931", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:\n\n1: The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US university stay in the country and let them keeping making contributions to the US.\n\n2 Diversity is very important to US culture and science development.Most of these famous scientists and engineers who did contributions to US economy and technologies were international students \n\n3 Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.

American economy thrives on open market competition and capitalism. America has been preaching that to gain access to other economies around the world. Even the most recent Trans-pacific partnership has the underlying fundamental of fair and open competitive platform across boundaries.  \n\nThe Reform should definitely:\n- protect F1 Students from being exploited. Like companies who ask them to take lesser rates/salaries in favor of H1B filing. By allowing F1 EAD students to be able to self apply their H1B applications throughout the year (like for certain H1B applications where immigrant is working for educational research institute etc) in an easy way (probably filling an online application) would greatly reduce this scheme.  Merging the path of F1 EAD holders with Employment based H1B category makes these students (mostly very young and slightly less experienced) vulnerable thus allowing companies to take advantage of their vulnerabilities. This loophole is the main culprit that creates a financial incentive for companies to fire american workers and hire immigrant workers.\n\n- Also quota of VISA should be further divided based on work specialities defined by DOL and adjusted based on market demand in those specialities. It definitely is more complex than current one bucket system but would be more competitive and fair. With Industry leading towards mainstream supercomputing, artificial intelligence and neural networks it's hard to imagine it would be impossible. \n\n- Reform should also be instituted at university admissions where more transparency, data and statistics of \"job opportunities and probability of Work authorization in future\" should be shared by federal government or at least regulated/mandated by federal government. If students applying in let's say MS in Botany are told upfront that the job opportunity in the field would be limited (based on statistics and number of VISAs available in category and number of applicants every year) that student would no the true financial value of the degree from US rather than the hypothetical sales pitch by US universities abroad.\n\nBy not implementing an extension rule, because some insecure american residents feel that immigrants will take their jobs would be anti-competition and straight against the fundamentals of american economy. Not to mention outrightly against american values to be a nation of immigrants from 1400's when first immigrants came to charlestown. \n\nStudent programs get the best of the best from the world. Look at Elon Musk and many like him. People against the reforms are the same ones who will be very happy to go and work in the GIGA factories and industries people like Elon have setup and amount of jobs innovators like him have created in USA. If things have to be argued for fairness and we donot allow reforms like this one, then if a big business is setup by new immigrants we should also create a rule that allow only immigrants to work in that business. How would that kind of mentality work for American economy.\n\nImmigrants keep the US economy moving by increasing competition every year, keeping workers on their toes to deliver in the job functions and not get complacent, which is a big problem with many american workers in many industries. People just want to get a paycheck without any reflection on what their true contribution to the company/industry is.\n\nI have worked in 7 companies by now from east to west coast and company after company have double tripled their operations with the help of a workforce mixed with citizens and immigrants. Without such competitions business operations were riddled with inefficiencies, cost and complacencies. On top burdened under the attitude of \"entitlement\". \n\nBy not allowing 24 (better 36 months) extension and keeping EAD timeframe to just 12 months will cut the F1 student applying for MS programs substantially considering \n- it's not cheap to first get degree from US (dollar is always dominant currency as compared to others)\n- with bucket of only 25K for H1B VISA (not to mention common bucket across the full spectrum of STEM specialities) and ever overflowing general quota of 60K, the probability of an F1 student getting H1B VISA to continue to work after 1 Year is reduced substantially.\n\nSTEM Extension is not a solution to the underlying problem but still gives foreign students better chance to get the value worth of their money spent with US Universities.  \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rohit Mahajan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8036", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "With many Americans out of work keep the foreigners OUT!!!!!!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Robert Reynolds", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8756", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Part III\n\n(4. The OPT program runs contrary to the purpose of non-immigrant student visas.)\n\nA longer OPT period is viewed as a means to give more chances to apply for an H-1B visa that in turn allows applying for immigrant status.

Therefore, the extensions are extremely important.\"), ICEB-2015-0002-1384 (\"I am supporting for OPT extension to 24 months for STEM. It will help us to our next step of getting H1B Visa.

Clearly, many aliens are coming to United States on student visas with the intent to remain permanently, in violation of the terms of their visa. This proposed rule aids such aliens in their unlawful purposes.\n\nThe volume of such comments showing that aliens come to the United States intending to violate their student visa attestation that they intend to return home should cause DHS to reevaluate the wisdom of allowing work after graduation. \n\nDHS is transforming the statutory authorization for admission \"solely for the purpose of pursuing [] a course of study\" into \"for pursuing a course of study or hanging around long enough to get an H-1B visa.\" In particular, the Cap-Gap provision of the proposed rule serves no purpose than to assist aliens, who are supposed to be here solely for the purpose of study, to remain in the United States in violation of the terms of their admission.\n\n5. The proposed rule will make it harder to get H-1B visas. \n\nWhile many commentators perceive the proposed rule as a vehicle for getting an H-1B visa, the actual effect is to make it harder for anyone to get a visa. Creating more opportunities to apply for an H-1B visa without increasing the number of visas available simply increases the number of visa petitions, decreasing the likelihood of any particular petition getting approved. At least one other commentator pointed out this problem. ICEB-2015-0002-5815.\n\n6. Educational Purpose\n\nAs the comments by OPT participants show, the program has limited (if any) education value. In reading through the comments, I was unable to find any comment where someone described how the OPT program is related to a course of study or is a means to achieve specific educational goals (beyond just being able to get work experience).\n\n7. Industry has no expertise to establish mentoring program.\n\nIt is commendable that DHS has recognized that OPT currently has no educational purpose by requiring the establishment of a mentoring program. The problem with DHS's proposal is that mentoring programs for new graduates are rare, particularly in technology fields. DHS is telling employers to set up a new system that has never existed without providing any guidance on how these mentoring programs are to be set up. The likely result is that employers will just go through the motions to provide whatever paperwork DHS requires without going any further.\n\n(continued)\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by John Miano", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9802", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the idea of STEM extension.

Many of my IT friends and family through the years have been permanently replaced by foreign workers from Pakistan and India and no longer are able to find work in their chosen profession and have had to take much lower paid jobs at big box stores because of it ! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!\nNow imagine that same thing happening in thousands of companies employing programmers, researchers, software engineers and just about every other job. Hundreds of thousands of jobs will be taken away from Americans!!\n\nThis program called the \"Optional Practical Training\" (OPT) program, is a kind of twisted jobs program for foreign students only. Under the current OPT program, about 130,000 foreign students are given temporary work permits for one or two years. The program is already a scam, since no \"training\" is given to anybody. These are simply more foreign workers to replace people like our college graduate kids.\n\nUnder the new rule, more than half a million additional foreign students would qualify for the newly expanded \"OPT\" job program, bringing the total to a potential 700,000. \n\nThe jobs these workers are taking are pretty good jobs, averaging about $50,000 a year. Some are paid more than $100,000. \n\nWouldn't you and your kids (and grandkids) like a chance at these kinds of jobs? Wouldn't it be terrible if your kids and/or grandkids lost their current jobs, only to be replaced by these \"OPT\" workers?\n\nWhy are the \"OPT\" foreign workers more likely to get these jobs?\n\nFirst of all, most of these foreign employees will pay no Social Security payroll taxes, and neither will their employers. An average of $11,000 that employers save per employee by not paying payroll taxes. \n\nA big bottom-line incentive for employees. \n\nBecause of this, the Social Security fund is already shortchanged more than $1 Billion a year. \n\nThat's $1 Billion LESS to pay to American retirees. \n\nWhen the OPT programs expands, if this rule goes through, the Social Security/Medicare funds will be shortchanged by $Billion$ more $$.\n\nA second incentive to bypass American workers: Although many of the OPT workers are paid well, there is no requirement that employers pay them a prevailing (standard) wage to these foreign replacement workers. \n\nThe employers can easily drop salaries. Add that to the average $11,000 that employers save per employee by not paying payroll taxes, and how can American graduates compete with that?\n\nIt also disgusts me that these following companies are lobbying hard for expanding the OPT program ! i.e. Disney, Toys R Us, SunTrust Bank, QUALCOMM and Microsoft. That's a lot of nerve for those last two ! and QUALCOMM has announced layoffs for 4,500 Americans, and Microsoft plans on laying off 7,500 in the coming year ! What ? To replace them with OPT employees ? I am completely disgusted by congress and the fascist corporatocracy than now controls our spineless, gutless, graft riddled congress and our government , to say the least !!!!\n\nOn top of that, The pro-immigrant, anti-American Obama administration admits that the main purpose of the expanded OPT will be to give more foreign workers time to transition into longer-term H-1B workers. \n\nSo, During these next three to six years,  companies have the time to sponsor the H-1B employees to get permanent  employment visas !! And what the hell are Americans who want a job or need a job , are going to do when we Americans are being exponentially replaced by foreign workers because of our lame duck , race to the economical bottom by these atrocious policies !!\n\nThe OPT jobs giveaway program is so bad, even the pro-amnesty AFL-CIO came out against it !!!!!\n\nRichard Trumka said that OPT and similar guest worker programs \"do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum, let alone the prevailing wage.\"\n\nNow, think about this. American colleges produce about 300,000 STEM graduates per year. Many of them already cannot find jobs in their fields !!!\n\nThis new expanded OPT program that our anti-American, pro-immigrant POTUS Obama is pushing through will swamp the job market with cheap, no-tax-paying foreign workers angling to become permanent employees, then citiziens, and will collect Social Security one day that they never paid anything into !!! \n\nI vehemently oppose the new OPT rule and any spineless American who would vote for it is a traitor to the American people !!!!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by william wollmuth", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9670", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I'm a Ph.D. Student in chemistry.

Summary of the Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action\n\nThe proposal would again provide for an extension of OPT for certain F-1 students with STEM degrees. As compared to the 2008 IFR, the proposed rule includes the following changes:\nLengthened STEM Extension Period for OPT. The proposal would increase the OPT extension period for STEM OPT students from the 2008 IFR's 17 months to 24 months. The proposal would also make F-1 students who subsequently enroll in a new academic program and earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level eligible for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension.\" \n\n\nI strongly agree with that it will benefit international student a lot by having a 24 months OPT extension instead of 17months. Due the the H1B lottery situation that gets worse and worse every year, i have many international friends who have to leave US just because they did not win the H1B lottery for two times in two years. They had full time job in US and they did really good jobs so it is really unfair and sad for them to leave just because they don't have luck. By extending OPT extension to 24 months. A lot people will be able to get another chance to win the H1B lottery and get to stay in US for a longer time!

Unlike non-STEM majors, STEM-related jobs typically involves longer term projects with technical nature. Therefore, extension allows F1-students to be able to get fully trained and more valuable experience after they return to their home countries.\n\nSecondly, I'm opposed to some comments which claim international STEM students steal jobs from US citizens due to low wages. As far as I know, it usually costs more for the employers to hire non-citizens. Many rules and regulations have minimum wage requirements for international employees. And most F1-students leaves US after OPT, unless they are sponsored by the employers for H1B or Green Cards. \n\nThirdly, diversity is important for US. I believe US employers won't just hire a foreigner just because they're cheap (in fact, they're not cheap). Hiring decisions should be based on talent.

I saw lots of negative comments said that \"OPT extension will make US citizen hard to find a job\". However, if you think more, that's not right.\n\nFirst of all, this new rule only valid for international students who are in STEM major. Students in other major just got 1-year OPT chance to work in US, which we can treat it like a study experience for post-graduate. There is no harm for current citizen, because employers are always willing to choose a employee who can work longer rather than a contract employee.\n\nSecondly, even for current students, who hold STEM degrees, this OPT-extension won't bring them any advantages when seeking for jobs. Common case is, when a company is considering to choose from two candidates - one is international students requires VISA support and the other is US citizen - if they have almost the same abilities and talents, the company will always choose the latter because hiring a citizen will cost them less expense in general. However, it is because current society needs more human resources with high-tech background, and there is limit number of citizens can meet such demands, international students can get this chance to stay and work here.\n\nFinally, I strongly believe this rule actually brings US citizen more benefits rather than harms. Based on the second reason I provided - almost all international students are not competing with US citizens but make up for high demands for employees with strong technical abilities in current society, this will bring enough talents, innovation and thus higher revenues for those companies, as well as make them stay in the top-level in the world, which in turn makes Unite States stays on top. At the same time, US gov can gain more tax income and use it to create more benefits for US citizens. Thus, US citizens will benefit from this rule at the end.\n\nI hope all of you can think deeper on this new rule.

I support the proposal for the following reasons:\n\n1, a suddenly cut-off of the policy will also cause a gap of human labor market, especially in the field of high technology companies, which are now famous around the world, but may decay in any five years. As Bill Gates once had said and I quote: \"Microsoft is always at risk of being bankrupt in 18 months.\"[1] Or \"Bankruptcy is only 18 months away for any firm.\"[2] The Cancel of improving and Expanding OPT sharply is dangerous to all the high tech companies, looking for further developing and growing, in the recent future.\n\n2, The timing of canceling is not fair. People graduate in the previous year had already enjoy the goods bring by the policy, however, the next generation will not, with is cruel.\n\n3, The alternative solution is not fair. If the existing policy is cutting off. The only way for a non-immigrant students to continue there work is the draw-lots. It's totally like a half-half thing.\n\n4, Another thing related to the alternative solution will be, previous STEM students may have at least two times in the shuffle-draw, and will work at the company for like 27 months. The new-graduated students will have a longer and suitable period of time to show their genius. If they got great performance within the time, if they all fail at the shuffle-draw, the company will also willing to hiring them, maybe in another ways, such as assign them to foreign lands rather than the US. US big companies have branches all around the world. HOWEVER, for the students, who would be more willing to do this in one year, not mention that new-graduated students probably not be able to have some achievement within such short hurried time(just one year). STEM students who just find their job will start to worried about and look for their future potential work, which will also reduce the productivity of US society. One fact we can not deny, new-graduated STEM students provide a lot to the high tech companies of US, and these high tech companies offer a lot in the GDP of US.\n\n\nLast, to my person view, the solution to this issue is somehow adjust the total number of non-immigrant students allowed to have their h1b. Shuffle may not be a good solution, as in different year the total need for the OPT is different, and the number is growing year by year as we all can see.\n\n\n\n[1] http://forum.thefreedictionary.com/postst31828_Moore-s-Law.aspx\n[2] https://www.facebook.com/Best.Quote/?fref=nf", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chen Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19424", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree with an extension of OPT period for STEM students. \nWell-known and profitable tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple) need a large group of graduated students have STEM degree.

The initiative has taken various steps to enhance and improve the Nation's nonimmigrant student programs.\n\nCountries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students.For instance, Canada also recognized that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment.\n\nU.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. Technique companies like Uber, Facebook are at the moment trying to open their market in foreign countries like China, in this way, they need employees who are from those countries and are thus well aware of marketing and technique conditions in those countries. \n\nInternational students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States.

For example, I am a Master student in Electrical Engineering, and I spent 12794.14 dollars per semester for over nine credits as a non-resident. Meanwhile, a resident master student spent 6010.14 per semester for the same credits. My total expense per semester is more than two times than that of a resident. My parents paid my all expenses including the tuition fees and living expenses at the USA with money earned for more than ten years with a less than two-thousand dollars monthly salary in a small city at China. Because they want to provide me the best education, so they poured most of money into my education at the USA. Therefore, I have tried my best to study hard for two years because this opportunity is an exchange of my parents over ten years works. After studying at University with double tuition fees, our international students also need internships or work experiences as same as resident students. \n\n2.\tInternational students are very difficult to find an internship or a job in the USA compared to the citizens. For instance, I finished all my course works, and I will graduate soon. Now I am looking for an internship and last week I got two on-campus interviews from an IT company at my University. I got great interviews, and they said I impressed them a lot. I also applied for more than ten positions at that company. However, after interviews and many applications, I just received one by one reject email from the firm because I cant work for a long time without sponsorship, even I can use 12 months plus 17 months extension. They even dont want to give me any further interview for any internship position because of sponsorship. In comparison, American citizens very easily got the further interview including on-site interview if they impressed the initial interviewer. I just want to mention that even though we had 29 months opt, we still have higher wall to get an offer from the US Company than citizens because of our work authorization limitation. Citizens have the great and incomparable advantage in getting jobs than international students with OPT extension.  \n\n3.\tI commented on STEM Extension Period for OPT article.\n\nIn this modern society including USA and China, graduates should have degrees and work experience both to get a chance to find a good job at the company. Studying in US University is a great challenge for us because of language so we should spend more time to study. Also, we spend more time and energy to prepare and find an internship or a full-time job at the US because many small or medium size US companies do not want to hire international students because of sponsorship. If we luckily get an internship or a full-time job at a firm, but only have one year or less time to work, and then we cannot have enough work experience or even no work experience at the US. After going back our home countries, we will be almost treated as same as or a little better than the graduates in China. Then there is no reason to spend 30000 dollars per year to study at the US instead of starting working in our home countries. If we have three years opt to find jobs and work, and then we have enough time to finish a companys project that will take around one to two years. With this practical training, international students can have a strong competitiveness in our home countries than others and find a good job. Then it is worth for investing much money in the study in the United States because we can obtain enough work experiences to find jobs.  \n  \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qiang  Cui", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20261", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am going to US for graduate study in engineering next spring, and i think the extension of opt is a GREAT opportunity for me to obtain working experience after graduation.

The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.

International students are making enormous contributions to US companies. In many big companies, especially in high tech industry, international student graduates accounts for a large portion of total number of employees and this number is increasing year over year. They are playing crucial roles in those companies and among the best in their fields. If they no longer have permission to work in the US, those companies will suffer great losses, so as the US economy. On the other hand, many big U.S. employers are global companies, and by hiring those international students they will also gain more knowledge on their home country, which is very beneficial to their business there.\n\nI viewed many comments opposing this proposal, and I found most of their arguments inaccurate. Many commentators are worried about wages. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. Others are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs. I also think that's not gonna happen. First, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US, and the OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if get caught. Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies.\n\nFinally, diversity is one of the core values in this society. International students have become integral parts in this diverse society. If this proposal is not approved, America is likely to be much less attractive to international students because of less chance to stay after graduation, which is not only the outcome colleges do not want to see, but also a terrible scene for the whole US society.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jack Lin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17463", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's good for overall US economy, which will bring back even more jobs in the long run.

The proposed rule would help ensure that US's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States. This is not to say that domestic students will have less opportunity to enter into and complete a degree program. Universities, especially in the STEM field, need many talented students to diligently learn and carry out researches. Despite many funding sources available to US domestic students, there still are't enough domestic students to maintain the research institution functioning. To alleviate this problem, measures need to be taken to attract and educate more domestic students in the STEM field, but not to halt the program that would temporarily fill the gap of the lack of domestic students. \n2. Same reasoning can be applied to the job market. Positions need to be filled up with experienced workers. It has to be filled up with foreigner only when there is no domestic worker competing on the same level. Those who graduated from US institution with STEM degrees committed their several years of life in education and were often working on projects funded by US organizations/companies. It will unfavorably affect US economy and national security if those talents are returning to competing countries. Policy should focus on supporting US workers to be trained at low or no cost to them, either part-time or full-time depending on individual situation. While this takes time and cannot be done at all levels, temporarily filling the gaps with US trained STEM students is certainly an effective measure at the moment. \n\nAll in all, OPT extension is an effective way to attract the talents to stay and to help US economy grow.

While the working visa is mostly from OPT STEM. Which also means, if OPT STEM is not going to continue, they would not be able to contribute as they could in the before, then firstly it is a loss of US since the demand of high educated employees in certain industries can not be satisfied any more, and this may further cause the much less development for the whole country; second, these high educated people can go to some other countries and then cause the US lose the competitive position in so many fields;\n\n2) What the foreign students can bring to US is not only the ability to work and contribute as an employee, they would also work as the bridge between US and so many other counties. For international companies, international students can help to communicate and even bring some business relationships. Especially for emerging markets. On the other hand, since the international students need to pay much more for their tuition, schools especially colleges can then have more funding for research and then contribute the whole society with more academic support. \n\n3) Also, in terms of tax stuff, though international students may pay less tax as they can exempt the SSN for F1 period, but once they get into H1B, they would have to fully contribute as a US citizen in terms of tax pay. I was told by a consultant that a quantitative financial engineer would need to support a 5-people family with both parents file unemployment. While right now I would say 50% of the quant in financial industry are international immigrants, who came here for college/graduate schools, get a job, file H1B with OPT STEM, and keep contribute to the society for all these years. \n\nAnd I want to say to those who argue that the foreign would worse the employ rate for US citizens that, the competition is not just inside of US any ways. For those who are educated, talented and work hard, no matter where they are, they would contribute to the company and country he stays in. If that is not US, maybe in short term that your family/friend gets a job, bur in long run, if US loses the competition as a whole country, all the companies in the country would need to cut cost and hire less, then maybe those who are now with a job would be jobless. US is getting to an aging society already now, and it is in the need or more educated and high skill set people to support the industries and contribute the tax. \n\nUS has been a country of high equality and with the belief that you can achieve anything if you think, work and contribute.

Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by xinyi zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18922", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly believe this OPT extension rule will benefit both international students and this country.

OPT extension rule requires international students work for E-varify companies in order to keep the OPT. Those E-varify companies always consider citizens first when they have a job opening, because hire an international student is way more complicated than hire a citizen with same skill set and capability, also they may lost their international employees due to the H1B lottery based system and this is a risk they want avoid. So international students come in only because there are a shortage of qualified candidates among citizens.\n\nIn the long term benefits, international students will increase the jobs not decrease. Good competition help tech companies gathering more talented candidates, industries will grow and thriving with these talents and only a prosperity economy would create more jobs. Also the evidence shows many foreign students like start new business; between 2006 to 2012 one quarter of start up engineering and technology companies have an foreign student as one of the key founders, these new companies provide more jobs to the pool.

That's very correct from a communist perspective. However, who are really the native citizens of US? What made US one of the most developed nations of today? Was that really because of the native population living here before Columbus? Well, the immigration system of today (especially the OPT and STEM extension) acts as a filter to extract the smart people from around the world while blocking the less smart/ less hardworking ones. Since the population of US is only around 5% of the total population of the world, it's much more likely to find smart people from outside of US than inside. But their native countries don't give them enough support and opportunities and they are just a minority there without much voice in the politics (so, many of them \"migrate in search of better pastures\" to US or to other countries). Another fact is that STEM extension actually encourages more and more competition in those fields which directly result in the country's progress. Doesn't that also make native Americans more competitive because they now have to work harder to deal with the competition from outside? How is giving a job to a more capable/ hardworking foreigner viewed as \"stealing\" from the Americans? (when in fact, Americans get equal or even more advantages because of being born in the US, having no visa rejections, no strict OPT deadlines, less tuition, no language barriers etc.?).

I am a mother of an international student who currently works on her OPT for the US employer. The reason I sent her abroad to the United States like most other families is the same. We believe U.S is a place where it provides opportunity for anyone who would like to use their knowledge and hand to work.For her master degree in USA, I spent over $75000 for her tuition and expenses, which is certainly a large amount of money to our family when we consider the exchange rate. Why do we send our kids to USA instead of other countries? It is because USA provides the OPT program for these students after their studies while other countries do not. But the one-year OPT program is too short that our kids only take from the company instead of doing their contribution. It is not good for the company nor to the kids' career development. However, if the OPT program can be extended another 24 months, the total would be three years, and I believe they will add value to the US companies and play a very important role in their team. If the OPT program is not granted for another 24 months, I think most potential students who would like to go for a STEM program will restart thinking and most likely they would choose not to go abroad since the cost-return plan is not good and they would rather go to other countries for a abroad experience since all will be similar if the OPT plan is not good. In the long term, the education benefit that US colleges and universities get from overseas will shrink, which will not be good to the academic environment, in return, the quality of graduates will be influenced.\nIn the mean time, some people would say that OPT STEM brings less opportunity for the local US citizens. However, it is not true. I can tell from my kid's experience. It is much harder for international students to find a job than a local people. A higher skill and knowledge is needed and the degree also is high. International students do the jobs that most of US citizens cannot do or do not have that ability to do. That is the reason they get hired because they have the skills that people do not have. Therefore, if these international students are laid off because the OPT cannot be extended, thousands of hundreds of companies will be affected and they would take a lot of time to hire the right person. And we know that the expense for hiring and training would be high especially for the right person to do the right job.\nTherefore, I hope the US would pass the rule for extending the OPT STEM program.

This is for students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics or STEM.  \n\nLast year, the Center for Immigration Studies found that this program CAN have an ADVERSE impact on American Tech workers.  For example: there were 497,274 work authorizations granted through OPT between 2009 and 2015.  These workers AND their employers are exempt from payroll taxes costing the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds $4,000,000,000. (that's 4 BILLION DOLLARS).  Also, employers are not required to pay prevailing wages meaning they can hire OPT workers for lower wages than American workers performing the same tasks.\n\nThe OPT program was designed to allow the students to gain work experience while they study so that they can return to their country.  INSTEAD-this proposed rule would help create a bridge to an H-1B tech-worker visa and possibly eventual employment.\n\nThis amounts to the administration caving in to tech companies giving them the cheap labor they want, and essentially  turning their backs on AMERICAN tech workers (where they would have to pay taxes and the prevailing wage).  How will this help AMERICANS studying STEM get jobs?\n\nA group of tech workers, the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers had sued the federal government-they showed that indeed, there would be lost jobs and wages for AMERICAN tech workers which is why the federal government is going through this rule making process.\n\nLet's have some fairness to American Tech Workers!

Support all types of jobs for USA citizens. Let the foreign governments support the education of foreign students. Let the foreign governments provide jobs for their own citizens\"\n\n--The United States has been attracting the most talented students to bring productivity, creativity and innovations to its land. The Chinese and Indian government are desperately trying to attract these talents to study and work in their own countries, so that they could beat the US company competitors, and relocate businesses, factories, technologies, and job opportunities, to their own countries from US. \n\n\n\"I'm against the expansion of foreign , aliens, UnAmericans & anyone who believes in Sharia Law to stay in AMERICA after graduation. 60 days or Deported.

Because I have witnessed so many brilliant foreign students in the university I work for.

What I agree with is the extension is necessary. The STEM majors are significantly from other majors, they need experience. No graduates can assure to be 100% qualified for the job, so there is a gap between graduation and becoming a qualified employee, and this gap mostly will need 2 to 3 years with the training of the employers. \n\nFor those people who adverse such proposal, I can truly understand them.

Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world.\n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Besides, basically an international student need to spent more than $100,000 in education in order to get a BS or MS degree. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n\nAdmitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vincent Mowery", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22225", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because:\n\n1. American universities spend a large amount of resources to train STEM students. If the US is going to simply let those highly trained students to go away, then the US is simply wasting its own resources. As a result, I believe the government should try to retain STEM students to contribute to the US.\n\n2. Many people believe that retaining foreign STEM students create a competition against Americans in the job market. Even if we assume it is true, competition still does more good than bad in this case. Because for the US to maintain its dominating power in various field in the world, it must have the most competitive work force in the tech field. And increasing competition also urges local Americans to increase their capabilities as well. So this would increase the general competitiveness of talents within the US to face the rapidly changing world.\n\n3. It's doubtful that OPT can cause bad competition for American workers. In my graduate school, there are only a few Americans STEM students. Yet almost all graduate students(foreign or American) are able to find a high-tech job after graduation. This means the high-tech job market is able to accommodate foreign STEM students, and the few numbers of American students are simply not enough for the high-tech fields in the US.   \n\n4. The US was the land of freedom for immigrants. Most of the population of this country are descendants of people from all over the world.

Hiring foreign workers is wrong when so many Americans need jobs.  Just look what Disney did to their AMERICAN workers.  You want to see more AMERICANS out of work.  Just read below all the things that have happened to hurt AMERICAN workers!  I know first hand about being not hired because of foreign workers.  You really need to go after businesses that hire foreigners and especially the illegals.  Stop this hiring and more Americans will find work.  Businesses will have to up the wages to a living wage to pay for the American worker.  For too long businesses have been allowed to pay under the radar for cheap foreign labor of which many fail to follow our laws like coming here legally, getting insurance for their vehicles and many drive with no DL's.  I know because I have met them.  Oh and let's not even talk about those workers at the packing plants!  They don't speak English and they are paid well under what an American would be paid.\n\n\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\tOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n\tOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\tThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\t\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\tthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\t\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\t\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\t\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n\n\n\n \nMichael J.

Whoever comes to the US for a doctorate is likely to start his OPT after the 5th year, therefore paying the same taxes as a US worker. I have been here for 7 years and I do pay taxes down to the last cent as anybody else in this country. \nMoreover, please consider to include in the rule all the issues that a corporation has to undergo when hiring a foreign national. Hiring foreign people means that an immigration lawyer has to be paid in order to file H1B Visa petition. As all of us know, there are many more petitions than available VISA each year. Therefore hiring a foreign national means that you may invest in someone, train him to do his job well and then when you are ready to take advantage of his skill set you may have to face the fact that you have to fire him because of the lack of H1B visas.The result is that on 100 applications that you send out, 90 come back just because corporations do not want to deal with the immigration issues. This rule will provide more stability. Well done. Now please consider all the negative comments (stealing US jobs thing) and answer to them. In 2015 a world leading country cannot, repeat cannot, afford to think in that way.

A 24 month stem opt extension offers students more valuable working experiences and in the long run build a healthy ecosystem for students studying aboard.\nMost oppositions against 17-month opt extension itself or against improving 17 month extension to  24 month are short-sighted and even biased. Stem OPT students are great workforce to drive up economics of US.  Ruling out 17 month opt extension will break the workforce for now and in future, causing a great loss of lots of American Company too.  Many may say foreign students took away jobs from citizens and residents, while I believe that job market is a fair game. The fear of jobs being taken away by others is an illusion. The economy will only be able to create more jobs when it has many good workforce to drive it forward. \nIf from the very beginning when US schools accepting students from foreign countries, the deals was to be clear that perspective students do not have the opportunities to stay for training after they graduate, simply less students would come for the education. It is a loss for many universities as they don't think that foreign students are taken away opportunities for others students to go to college or grad school. In the opposite, based on my observations, foreign students are more likely filled in the departments whose majors are less popular with US students. In these senses, foreign students has made great contributions to revenues of the universities, and grad students in particularly contribute significantly to research done in many research universities. In many senses, a 24-month OPT extension is a healthy stimulant and a win-win policies for students, universities, and employers.

I am an international student at a university of the U.S. According to my observation, over half of the students majoring STEM are international. Just like me, many of those students are attracted by the original OPT extension policy. My university is located at a small town of the Northeast. However, this small town is becoming more prosperous than any other towns nearby. One crucial reason is the growing number of international students in this town. The housing, the food, the retailing commerce has been growing fast in this town because we those international students are the major customers. It is predicable that once the STEM opt extension has been cancelled, most of the U.S universities will see has tremendous decrease in international students since the policy will be no more attractive than those of Canada, UK, Australia, or any other nations with high quality education. It is common that the families of international students invest a lot of money on their education. Many of the families buy cars or even houses for their children just in order to create an good learning environment. That's really a large amount of investigation. It is obvious that the investment will dramatically decrease if opt extension does not exist anymore.\nSecondly, it is true that many international students majoring in STEM find job in the U.S., but there are still a large portion of students who cannot find job in the U.S. Employers are smart enough to hiring only the qualified person. Therefore, even the OPT is extended, those international students who are not strong enough still cannot get hired, which does not create any threat to the U.S. citizens. On the other hand, if the OPT is not extended, Most of the U.S. citizens who are not strong enough still cannot get hired by those technology companies due to their hiring standard. Therefore, the OPT extension does not hurt the benefits of the U.S. residents/citizens. \nThirdly, the core reason why U.S. is the top nation around the world is that U.S. attracts talents all around the world. Most of the technology companies highly treasure talented scientists, engineers and mathematicians as they are the fresh blood of the companies. If the OPT extension is cancelled, it is certainly that U.S will lose a quite large amount of talents. \nTherefore, I strongly AGREE with the proposal for 24 month-extension of STEM OPT.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Oliver Ran", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12880", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Here is how I think of this extension.

For starters, this is not the poor international-student population from decades past, living on ramen noodles and making do without a winter coat. This is an increasingly affluent crowd, often coming from families that have accumulated great wealth in their home countries.\n\nThere are nearly 900,000 international students studying in the U.S., and they pump $27 billion into the U.S. economy each years, supporting 350,000 American jobs. It is not uncommon for an overseas family to budget $100,000 or more per year for their child's college tuition and living expenses in America.\n\nBut the real economic payoff to our cities and states happens when these students graduate and somehow find a way to stay.\n\nFirst, international students often possess the kind of science-technology-engineering-math skillsets that are in high demand in an innovation-based economy. For every 100 international STEM students who remain in the U.S. after graduation, 262 American jobs are created.\n\nSecond, immigrants play an outsized role in America's innovation and startup ecosystem. In Silicon Valley, much of the tech talent is foreign-born and 50 percent of the tech companies, from Google to eBay, have an immigrant founder. Forty percent of the Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child or an immigrant. And despite the foreign-born comprising only 13 percent of the U.S. population, 28 percent of all \"main street\" businesses in America have an immigrant owner. Studies show that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business or file a patent, compared to the American-born.\"", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4896", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I definitely give a support to STEM OPT extension.\n\nFirstly, when they do professional training here using OPT, they also need to pay all taxes required, which is not correct in some comments.

There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Masters degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nHence this new rule is very important for the U.S economy and timely implementation of this rule will prevent imposing a costly burden on the U.S. tech sector if thousands of young workers have to leave their jobs on February 12, 2016.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Mass Mail Campaign 22: Comment Submitted by Pranav Mungre, Total as of 10/23/2015 (2)", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0331", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}], "totalNumRecords": 22582}

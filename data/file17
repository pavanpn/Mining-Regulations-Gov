It will attract more smart students study in the US for college or higher education since the OPT extension regulation gives them the opportunity to practice what they learn in school after graduation. If more international students study in the US, colleges will have more income since they usually charge international students more. Besides, it will also increase US economy since more people stay in the US and make more consumption.\n\nOverall, the OPT extension is a very good regulation for USA. So I HIGHLY SUPPORT it!

The advancement of science and technology is a great advantage of the modern U.S. . In recent years the U.S. government has put out many policies to benefit the development of science and technology, and many hi-tech corporations as well as research institutes have put on projects in STEM areas. This will generate a huge need of specialists in STEM areas. Without these people the U.S. may  have difficulties in keeping its technology advancement.\n\nAt the same time, many foreign students are studying in STEM areas in the U.S. .Though some of them may not behave well, the majority of them are the elites of their homeland and they want to pursue the most advanced science knowledge in the U.S. .If not, these students can just stay in their homeland and have a good job, do not have to suffer the unfamiliar environment and language. So, with the dream of learning the most advanced science knowledge, the foreign STEM students can always make brilliant performances in their area and become good specialists, which is greatly needed in the U.S. currently. However, due to the restriction of their visa, these foreign STEM students  cannot have enough time and chances in finding works in U.S. . Many students may be forced to leave the U.S. at the end. However if these students can get their jobs in the U.S., probably they will make great progress in their area and these progress are belonged to U.S. companies and institutes.In this way,the modification of the visa regulations can help the U.S. keep significant number of STEM specialists and making the U.S. keep its advancement.\n\nOpponents of the regulations modification point out many problems. It seems the most discussed problem is that this modification can cause the native Americans to lose their jobs. However in STEM areas, discoveries and research results do not relate with the citizenships. Companies and institutes who want to make progress in STEM areas need to recruit people who can make the progress. To keep advancements in STEM areas, the U.S. should try best to gather elites from all over the world and especially pay attention to foreign STEM students. \n\nlong time ago, foreign scientists have made many great discoveries in the U.S..\nThe foreign STEM students today may become great U.S. scientists in the future, as long as they can have more time and more opportunities find training projects and become formal U.S. labors in U.S. companies and institutes. So I think it is necessary to make the modification of the visa regulations.

From a proper logic, US company must want a US citizen rather than an international student when they have equal abilities, not only because the US citizen can be more adaptive to their company culture but also it is more troublesome to recruit an international student. It is really a nonsense that  you blame that international students 'robbed' of your job. It is only because you are not competitive as the international student. It is also racial to request international students to go back to their country and don't rob of your job.

STEM students who received educations from top US institutions will be forced to return to China, India, Russia, France... to build business empires that rival US business.

However, most of the opponents of the program don't even know clearly about the OPT or STEM extension details. They just blindly comment that the program is bad or it puts foreigner's opportunities above the citizen's. However, these are completely false statements. They seem to me that the comments are made by losers who don't have the abilities and skills to take certain opportunities. Given same skill sets and abilities, corporations are obliged to give US citizens the priorities to be hired the under current law, not the foreign students. The only reason that these people are not hired by companies is because they are not well prepared or suited for the jobs. For example, in the Computer Science field, the demand for highly skilled workers are so strong that companies have to hire a lot of foreign students studying in the fields. Supplies for citizen workers are not enough. If these companies have to continuously lose highly qualified workers to companies in foreign countries, the highly technical initiatives that we see today may have great chances to be invented by other countries. \n\nIn a word, STEM students are not given any privileges to find an employment is the US but only a chance.

It is also common in silicon valley. In many large tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, many employee from new graduate engineer to CEO are international. They are necessary components making silicon valley machine running faster and faster, leading to more profound revolution! \n\n2. Many of local citizen hold the opinion that international students make them difficult in finding a job. Firstly, they are vey short sighted and selfish, not considering whole benefits to our country US. In the age of information and technology, not even US, many countries like UK, German, France, China have great need to excellent engineer and scholar, are willing to spend large amount of money to have them. How can we expel them, making these excellent international students return to their own countries? How can we provide the opportunity to let other countries to surpass America. Secondly, it is ridiculous to think international students increase the difficulty in finding jobs. Our country is a land full of dream. If you study hard and work diligently, how can you have difficulty in finding a decent job? Our society would benefit from the competition between international students and local students. Companies always select better people to better position. Thirdly, many international student opened a start up and could recruit more employee in US. For example, Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja. The founders are international, but they develop the company to big scale which has employee of 8000 right now. There are so many similar examples in our country and it happens every day.  \n\n3. OPT extension policy would play an important role to attract best people to US. Excellent international students could also make contribution to US after graduation. Some of them enter university and academy. They are doing research and come up with new theory. For example, during my study in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, my machine learning course professor is also international. He takes seriously the challenge of building agents that can interact with other agents and even humans in both artificial and natural environments. If this policy is abandoned, how can universities and research centers recruit smartest students with interests in doing research. \n\nWhy do many international students come to US to achieve their personal goal? Because we have best quality education, appropriate policy, and open and freedom environment. These elements are the engines contributing to the prosperity and economic boom of USA.                   \n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by David Cheng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21220", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Stop bringing  in F1 Stem students for  'training' .

Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\n \nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.The most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nvedangsawant\n\n\n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vedang Sawant", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5368", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am supporting the proposed extension rule.

There is no evidence that the STEM is the tool for the IT companies to access lower wage workers. You have to understand that companies would have more expenses in order to hire people working on OPT/STEM/H1B, such as hiring lawyers, filing expensive applications, and also having a risk of losing the international employee if work visa/permit expires. BECAUSE of these additional expenses and risks, companies would pay less to people with OPT/STEM/H1B, compared to local people. AND this is why when two job candidates who have the same skill sets, it's always the local person who is preferred for the position. \nAND people have to understand about the hiring process. Companies first post positions with a salary, then interview all candidates, and then give out offers to qualified people, then the candidate can negotiate for a higher salary. (The company can't force down the salary when an offer is provided) Thus, companies would give an offer to an international candidate because he is qualified, not because the company can hire him cheap (because salary is negotiated after giving out the offer).\n\n2. OPT STEM would not hurt local workers. Why would the company go through all these trouble to hire international software engineers? because they can't hire enough local software engineers. Even without the OPT STEM, companies won't hire local people who don't know how to code and train them to be software engineers. But in the meantime, think about how OPT STEM would increase more local jobs. More lawyers are needed. More immigrants and foreigners will come to USA, and they need to eat, live, buy stuff, commodities, right? That's more jobs needed to accommodate them in USA.\n \n3.People need to understand OPT STEM is only for people who has a master or doctor degree in the math, engineering, and technology field. People in STEM would not steal an average American job. People in OPT STEM would probably account for less than 1% of jobs in USA, and these high-tech jobs have a higher demand than supply. I totally understand that if these jobs have a higher supply than demand, then people with OPT STEM could be interpreted as \"stealing\" the local people's job.\n\n4. Once again, I would like to stress out this is OPT STEM, which is only related to high-tech. I totally understand that jobs should go to US citizens first, BUT they should go to US citizens who are fit for the corresponding jobs. The unemployment of US citizens is due to lack of education, or skill sets not fit for the position. Even without the competition of people with OPT STEM, they would still be unemployed. If Americans are worried about immigrants stealing jobs, they should just ban the whole immigration, which contributes to cheap labor. STEM IS NOT CHEAP LABOR. STEM is only about the high tech. All the negative comments about OPT STEM should instead address the overall immigration, not here. Their argument only applies to a proposal that bans all immigration.\n\n5. All the jobs are already going to USA citizens first, who are fit for the corresponding jobs. The companies of course wouldn't take any additional risks to hire an international person, if the company would hire a local person with the same skill. The international person might go back to home country anytime, either willing or forced (due to expiration of the work permit)  \n\n6. I thought America is a country of freedom, a country free of discrimination, a country that has equality of employment. Please keep me believing it this way. \n\n7. Once again, please calculate how many people are unemployed who are fit for the high-tech jobs. Stop using 20 millions unemployed Americans as a sentimental tool to persuade the public. I don't believe any of them have a STEM degree.\n\n8. Take my company for example, my company is paying international people the same as the Americans. And when one of the international colleague left the company because her work permit expired, the company hated to see her leaving, but there was nothing the company could do. There are thousands of this situation every year.

Last year, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to learn more about the OPT program and its impact on American workers. CIS found that:\n 497,274 work authorizations were granted through OPT between 2009 and 2015\n Both the workers and their employers are exempt from payroll taxes, costing the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds $4 billion\n\nAlso, employers are not required to pay OPT workers the prevailing wage, meaning they can hire OPT workers for lower wages than American workers who would perform the same tasks.\n\nThe OPT program was designed to allow foreign students to gain work experience in their field of study that would help them find work when they return to their home countries. However, the proposed extension for tech workers would, in effect, create a bridge to an H-1B tech-worker visa and eventual employment-based green cards.\n\nSimply put, the OPT program is an easy way for companies to recruit cheaper foreign workers at the expense of American workers and STEM students.

My comment comprises two parts: 1) arguments for evidence used in opposing comments and 2) suggestions for safeguarding native U.S. workers. \n\n1) Over 200 opposing comments quoted two conclusions \"OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013\", and \"OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds\" from an article by David North, such as comment ID 1jz-8lz5-5cro, 1jz-8m3a-b3c5, etc. The original article is titled \"Obscure Immigration Program Hurts U.S. Residents  Both Young and Old\".  However, both conclusions are obtained from calculations based on STRONG ASSUMPTIONS, not ACTUAL STATISTICAL EVIDENCE.\n \n1.1) For the conclusion about OPT denied jobs, North \"assume that virtually every job that is now filled by a 12- or a 17-month OPT worker could be filled from the vast number of unemployed residents of this country.\"  \n\nThis assumption relies on an illusion that the unemployed residents are from STEM major and have the same skill set as the job posting requires.  However, studies show job openings in STEM major takes longer to fill than openings in other fields. \"For STEM openings requiring a Ph.D. or other professional degree, advertisements last an average of 50 days, compared to 33 days for all non-STEM vacancies.\" (written by Jonathan Rothwell from the Brookings Institution) \n\nFrom an employer's perspective, hiring a native worker often ensure stable, long-term human resource with less regulatory procedures.  On the other hand, hiring an OPT student is a comparatively unstable and costly choice, because they do not know whether F1 students would be permitted to continue working in the country.  If yes, the employer needs to spend extra cost for possible sponsorship in work visa and green card applications.  If not, the employer may face the extra cost to hire and train another worker.   That is, when employers hire an OPT student, they probably face a situation that they could NOT find a native worker in STEM major with demanded skill set. \n\nFurther, lots of STEM major career opportunities need security clearance, especially in government research facilities and R&D department in industries, which are not available for F1 students.  \n\nIn fact, from my personal experience as a PhD student in STEM major, native students are always among the FIRST ones to land on a decent job, and usually have several job offers to choose from.  Most jobs are government research facilities, R&D department in Fortune 500 companies, and competitive startups.  Further, employers, especially midsize and small companies, often choose natives over F1 students to avoid extra procedures and costs.  \n\nMy personal observations resonate with the previously cited report.  That is, AFTER native U.S. workers with the demanded skill set are hired, there is still an un-filled demand in the job market.  Therefore it is a reasonable proposal to extend the OPT extension to 24 months. \n\n1.2) For the second conclusion regarding the moneys lost from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, North calculated the amount by multiplying years of tax-free status, the average annual pay and the Social Security/Medicare tax rate.  \n\nSocial Security is primarily the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance federal program.  Medicare provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system.  F1 students are NON-IMMIGRANTS who are not anticipated to retire in this country, why do they need to pay social security and Medicare tax for money they will never be able to use? When some of the F1 students change status and do become immigrants, for example through work visas, they are required to pay social security and Medicare.  Therefore, this is not an actual loss, merely stating a non-relevant calculation.  Isn't it too much to ask foreigners to pay for a fund intended for supporting retired natives? \n\nFurther, this opinion did not take into account the extra revenue employers may earn, thus tax gain for government, by hiring these students, or possible economic loss of the employers who cannot get those positions filled in time.  \nTherefore, the staggering numbers used by opposing comments are not evidenced-based and should be considered with critical perspectives. \n\n2) E-verify is a great procedure to ensure fairness in OPT employment. I suggest to consider following improvements A) public monitor pathway, for people with reasonable evidence to report misuse of related regulations; B) punitive measurements for employers who do not follow the regulations; C) differentiated extension period for STEM major undergraduate and graduate students based on job market demands; D) require LCA applications for hiring OPT students with an intended period longer than 6 months (summer/winter internships may be excluded for this measure).

As a STEM graduate, I noticed that my STEM program has been historically dominated by international students, due to the academic rigor and the quantitative skills required in accepting candidates. Giving permissions to international students to work in the United States will not only help them attain relevant experiences, but also help their STEM programs flourish and reinforce the industry-needed skill sets in classrooms. \n\nThe proposal will benefit the U.S. economy because some technical firms would not have a sufficiently large pool of talents to grow businesses if foreign nationals are excluded. Although we see some U.S. citizens that are great at technical skills, the scale of such talents is much smaller when compared to that of international graduates.\n\nOne additional benefit of this proposal for international graduates is, obviously, the extended period to work in the United States. As an applicant who filed for a H1-B petition this year but failed in the lottery, I know that there is preponderance of evidence where a firm files multiple petitions for an employee or a working professional files multiple petitions with different employers in the H1-B lottery process. This significantly lowers the probability of an applicant (who only files for one petition with his/her current employer) to be selected in the lottery. There are even some IT firms that tend to increase the H1B pass rate for employees in numerous ways, but they do this at the cost of the applicants who work for them--the pay is generally lower, which has an unintended consequence to the job market and creates a financial edge for these employers.Therefore, having the proposal approved would help rebuild the level field in the H1B lottery and brings back fairness to international hires in the job market. \n\nIn summary, the new OPT extension proposal is a policy that is beneficial to both the U.S. economy and educational systems. Equally important is that it infuses integrity and fairness to the H1B lottery.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Linan Bi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1491", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Legitimate U.S. citizens should always come first.

The jobs most needed by local people are not those STEM related jobs, and, in fact, companies are struggling to find people with STEM backgrounds because STEM majors are not so popular with local students.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Justin Steindorf", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3076", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the 24-month OPT STEM extension proposal for the following reasons:\n\nIn today's American Universities, more and more international students are enrolled in academic departments.

An average H1 Visa holder who has better work experience will end up paying more taxes than the STEM \nprogram beneficiaries which is unethical.\n\n2). STEM beneficiaries also have the liberty to change the employers while H1 visa holder do not have any such benefits even though he has problems with his employer which will make them more care free changing their jobs which might become problem for H1 visa holder who cannot shift his employer as easily as the STEM holder.\n\n3). More than half the STEM beneficiaries do not work in the area they graduated as their is no one who will check on which area they are doing the work..Most of the foreign nationals especially Indians work in different areas than the area they got the degree from or else they will just pay some money to unethical employers and get a letter mentioning they work for that employer and  get the approval for STEM extension and later they work illegally in Gas stations,Grocery stores etc..\n\n4). Few months back there was another rule which got implemented to give Work permit for certain category of H4(Dependent) Visa holders now this new rule..According to initial figures there are around 180000 persons who are eligible for working...If I am not wrong not even 10% of the that number would have entered into any Job..Personally I know lot of people who are in this Visa category searching for Jobs but not getting any opportunities so if this new rule gets implemented than what justice that the other Visa holders would get?\n\n5).America is land of dreams for many nations so there is no question to think that if STEM program beneficiaries are not allowed to stay in the country this country will not progress...Every Year new blood comes into the nation and out of which who have the merit to stay in the country will stay and the rest will go back but with this new rule lot of undeserved and unethical people will stay in America which in turn makes America not a land of dreams for future generations which could be a serious threat to the country in future years.\n\nThere are lot more problems with this rule but I want to stop here..................PLEASE STOP THIS RULE\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by John H.", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1180", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "More knowledgable and hardworking immigrants will boost our high tech industry and economic in short term, it will also improve US's human resources' competitiveness in long term.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kate Moss", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21701", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.\nI am a international stem student, who is willing to contribute what I learned in the US to the US.

My son found a job after submitting applications for 1.5 years after graduating with high honors with a double major from engineering school.

The developers and programmers at her firm have to be American citizens.  One does not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the discrepancy in wages.  And now with the movement to bring in more foreign workers with more Hb1s visas and the OPT program, the American worker and the STEM graduates will not have jobs. In the last seven years there are more STEM graduates than jobs, an over supply of workers, why do we have to increase the number of foreign workers in such an environment?  Why give employers the motivation to hire foreigners instead of Americans in not requiring them to pay payroll taxes for the foreign worker when the very programs that the payroll deductions provide, social security and medicare are going bankrupt?The incentive should be to increase payroll tax contributions.   Why is it that our president and his administration and agencies as well as our elected representatives  do not represent Americans anymore and prefer to displace the American worker with foreigners?

First of all, American high tech companies heavily rely on smart, highly-educated people who are Americans and foreigners. These people are dedicated to bring benefits to US economy. STEM F-1 students will not affect general unemployment rate because they are completing with highly-educated and brilliant Americans. If getting rid of these F-1 students, many less smart Americans will work for high tech companies, which will potentially do harm to American economy. You can't sacrifice future economy to decrease temporary unemployment rate. Needless to say the number of STEM F-1 students is very very small and STEM F-1 students are top people in the society. \n\nSecondly, this competition can greatly help Americans improve and learn from it. Moreover, US cannot lose these talent foreign people to make contributions to US. Because they are brilliant enough, if they go back to their home countries, US high tech companies cannot be top companies in the world. In a word, these STEM F-1 students are helping America and America economy.\n\nThanks!\n\nKevin", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kevin Han", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5219", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am from China and I think extending longer years for STEM is a smart move.

I am absolutely shocked that why we are here talking about shorten OPT during instead expanding it. Nowadays, non citizen STEM students have become a non-negligible and sometimes even backbone strength in US. They support and guarantee the technology and science of this country running in a healthy and progressive way. It is easy to see this point by counting the number of great scientist and engineers who are not citizens but did a great contribution to this country even world in past 100 years. Stop OPT extension, thus, will let a huge number of STEM students lost their job from universities, high tech companies and even governments. It is very hard to find qualified candidates to fill these positions up in a short time, which will cause millions or even billions of money lost due to this.\n\n2. Stop STEM extension and forbid foreign students working in U.S. do not mean more citizen students can get jobs. Because every qualified STEM students went through at least 6-12 years high intensive training in their areas before becoming an expert and getting hired by research institution, high tech companies and governments. Unless there are enough number of citizen students who can have the same experiences and qualified for high intensity workload in STEM areas, this country still needs a lot of non-citizen STEM students. Unfortunately, as what I saw in past few years during my time in U.S., few citizen students are willing to get a degree in any of STEM areas.\n\n3. Stop STEM extension means, U.S. government has to spent more money to educate a citizen student in STEM areas. Like what I mentioned in second reason, it takes many years and money to train a qualified STEM student. However, as most the case nowadays, most STEM students finish their secondary school education in their countries and just go through two years or even one year training in US's graduate school before they get hired.

OPT extension rule is a big, big attraction for foreign students to study in US. As           far as I know, most foreign students who are studying in US are in STEM major, and one   big reason that they choose to study in US is the OPT extension rule. They know they have 29 months to get trained after graduation. If the OPT gets back to 1 year, many foreign students will choose to study in other countries.\n\n2. If you really decide to close the OPT extension, I think you need to notice the students before they came to US. Many students currently studying in US did not know OPT extension will be revoked before they came out. Some of them are even in extension period right now. It would be a disaster for them if the extension is revoked.\n\n3 Foreign students bring so much economy growth in US by tuition and living expense. If we lose those students, we may lose ~$50 billion/year in economy growth.\n\n4 Many of the opponent argues that foreign students steal the job opportunities which belongs to citizens. They are saying that foreign students are underpayed and undereducated. In fact, OPT extension only applies to e-verify company. The companies enroll in e-verify program to show they treat every employee equally without racial/citizenship discrimination. So foreign employee will not get lower salary than local citizen. SO the only example of lower salary is the interns v.s. the employee. But you know foreign students with opt is only a subset of all the interns. I think they are arguing that companies should raise the intern salary, but it has nothing to do with the opt extension rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wei Shen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6045", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is important to understand that international students come to the USA and contribute to USA's growth, tech companies are booming because of this very reason.

This could be the reason that some people question about offering extended benefits for foreign students after graduation. What if people like us take up too many positions in the US? What will be left for real American citizens? In my opinion, their worries are not unreasonable, but most of them overlook specific details of OPT.\nFirst of all, OPT are short of optional practice training, which means some students would not even apply for it after getting their degree. Take me for example, at least 20% percent of my foreign classmates went back to their home country right after graduation. We are studying thousands of miles away from home for years, not to mention applying for OPT takes money and time, its quite common kids want to go back and have family reunion. On the other hand, college tuitions and fees are extremely expensive for foreigners since we usually do not have discount as domestic students. This means a large part of foreign students, especially undergraduates, come from families with decent income level, rather than we are trying to escape from poverty and war. Many of us just want to see the world and gain some experience, then go back to our not so rich motherland and make money. Usually, with US degrees and working experience, we are competitive in the job market in our hometown.\nSecond, among those who decide to use OPT, its just a beginning. Its only more difficult for a foreigner to find a same job as native workers. I sent out 150 applications to get my current job, and my foreign roommate took a year to finally get a slightly better job. In my class of year 2014, only 5 out of 20 international students got a job. They all tried until the last minutes of the 3-month grace period. We find a job because we failed thousands of times before this one, not because we are cheap labors and companies want to save money. Its hard to find a job in the US, but its not our fault. For most cases employers would worry about communications with foreigners, not to mention helping them get new a visa after OPT if they want to keep those workers. To be honest, employers can save couple grand of money by hiring US workers, thats why we work harder to for the same opportunities than some Americas. I believe most of us are not superior to US workers, we just dig out more potentials under all kinds of pressure as a foreigner.\nThird, we must notice that OPT extension is only valid for STEM students with an undergraduate degree or higher. Do American people feel that babysitters, housekeepers, blue collar labors are full of people who look like foreigners? This could be true, but do you believe higher educated foreign students would try to find such jobs only because they want to stay? In reality our goal is to learn major-related skills and develop ourselves, not to be cheap labors. What is more, we need to have a job related to our major to have valid OPT and OPT extension. Im sorry some illegal immigrations leave bad impression to American people, but we have legal status and we deserve the rights to learn work skills post-graduation. \nLast and the most importantly, by giving OPT to international students, employers have the opportunities to get more high-educated short-term workers without worrying about their status. I know foreign students become a big part of some IT or engineering companies, so people would argue about us jeopardizing American job market. Nevertheless, please thinking about what would happen if we all disappear at once. Those employers would suffer from huge shortage of labors and lost a lot of benefit. We are working to feed ourselves while staying abroad, not to kick US workers out of the market. Even if employers prefer foreign workers due to their skills, remove us from the US wont help native workers from the root. Try to look at tags of your clothes, or even your cellphones, are they made of US? Manufacturers set up factories in less developed countries since native labors are too expensive. The best way to defeat your opponents is never try to make them weak, but to make yourself stronger. Overprotection and localism may work at first, but employers would like more profits rather than hiring people for less salary.\nSo what I seeing here is a win-win situation for both international students and US people. We can learn from each other, benefit each other and make friends with each other. Why do you turn your back to friends and blame them for things they did not do? We came here because US is friendly and open, those are the good characters that make your country standing out for years. We may be unable to write persuasive comments, but I hope my post can help at least a little bit.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by WY ZH", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18422", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree with opt extention.

As a strong supporter for the proposal, I'd like to put forward and reiterate a few counter points to some of the most common misconceptions brought up by people on the other side of the conversation:\n\n1) STEM students work in the United States while on OPT or OPT extension are NOT illegal immigrants. This is absolutely false. Please review the official information following the links below:\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/eir/visa-guide/f-1-opt-optional-practical-training/f-1-optional-practical-training-opt\nhttps://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/17-month-opt-stem-extension \n\n2) Executive order's ability to bypass Congress is NOT illegal. The legislative body is not required to approve any executive order, nor can it overturn an order. \n\n3) Only master's and PhD students in the STEM fields are eligible for OPT extension. This community is only a small part of the entire applicant pool who files for H1B every year. \n\n4) If a candidate of U.S. citizenship is unqualified for a job that requires specific master's/PhD level training in STEM fields, it's NOT because the job is taken by an international STEM student, it's because he/she is NOT qualified. \n\n5) There's absolutely no evidence supporting the claims that companies pay lower than average wage to STEM students or STEM students willfully consent to lower than average wage in order to secure employment.\n\nAgain, in order to have a meaningful dialogue on the pros and cons of this proposal, people need to base their arguments on facts and logic, not lies and accusations.

Those people are so valuable assets to the country that they can contribute a lot and transfer all their technical skills as well as multi-culture background from school life to their work. In a long term, the whole country and the people who live in the country will benefit from F1 students' contribution. For instance, Sundar Pichai, CEO of google and Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft were former F1 student. They  received a good education in the U.S and eventually help a US company to succeed in the World. \n\nF1 students will add more diversities to the companies and potentially help the US company expand the business to the world. For example, I, myself, was a former F1 Student nowadays transferred to a H1B working visa. My current job is working as a technical consultant and help our client learn how to use our engineering software to solve their technical problem. When I worked within the group and with client, I can always provide a different perspective and help people make more thorough decision. My bilingual(Chinese and English) skills help me deliver the training classes more easily in China and some Asian country. I can see my company would like me to help them expand their business in Asia because I know the culture, have good education background and understand their local language. I am just an simple example representing thousands of international student's value.\n\nSome opponents may say those F1 students will steal the jobs of US citizens. Nevertheless, I can see a different perspective. In fact, most of the time those F1 students just help the US government fill the shortage of the employment in STEM subjects. U.S economy's booming replies on innovation. But in those high-tech areas, the companies cannot find the right candidate who are US citizens. That's why they want to employ F1 student even taking the risks of losing them due to the visa. If we help those F1 students, actually we are helping the US high tech companies.\n\n\nAll in all, I fully support this proposal.\n\nChen Su", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chen Su", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10678", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Yes, I agree to the expanding of OPT.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation.

If only students have more than 2 years training experience, they could actually learn and bring the skills back to their countries and apply. Therefore, students need longer OPT extension time for their training after graduating. For example, Uber has a China Growth department now only focusing on Chinese market. Let's say if a talent engineer student gets training here in the U.S., once he/she returns back to China, he/she could still contribute to Uber. Otherwise, if the student only gets training less than 1 year, how can Uber trust them and let them work in China. How will Uber be successful continuing business with China, the fastest growth market in the world. If STEM program gets cancelled, students will not get enough training before they go back own country and apply their skills they learn in the U.S. \n\nSome people think OPT extension is unfair. However, please pay more close attention to the requirements. Only E-verified companies have the right to give OPT extension. In that case, students who get OPT extension need to be smart enough in order to get this spot. When competition exists, you have to face the jungle law of capitalism. Companies need most talented people to complete their missions. It is very fair for both local Americans and international students since this competition is for everyone not just some groups of people. Just because companies open positions for anyone, it is the time to be on the same platform and show your talent. If OPT extension gets cancelled, a lot of companies are afraid to train international students because the time frame is too short and once students start to contribute, they have to leave. If that is the case, U.S. companies will not have enough work force to speed up company operations. I believe that, if OPT extension gets cancelled, students go back to their own countries and contribute. Sooner or later, developing countries like China will catch up the speed of technique in the U.S. Without doubt, the U.S. government will borrow more money from China. It will be a vicious cycle for the U.S. \n\nI appeal that all the people in the U.S. need to think carefully and predict the future when it comes to a big decision. Thinking about how bad effect it will bring, rather than just looking at superfacial or current results. OPT extension is the most powerful decision that gives American sustainability in items of economy and leading status in the world. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jane Yu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11653", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The extension of OPT program fuels US economy with more skilled and qualified manpower in STEM fields, which has a much lower unemployment rate than general work force (data from NSF http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NSFTable-large.jpg)\n\nForeign students pay tuition that is usually twice as much as American citizens do (taking Purdue as an example http://www.admissions.purdue.edu/costsandfinaid/tuitionfees.php) .

While American students have unlimited time to identify career opportunities and unlimited access to jobs (no objections here, totally respect citizen's rights), foreign students are faced with a three-month period to seek employment and limited access to career opportunities due to visa status and limited networking (more than half of companies listed in my university's job portal do not sponsor work visas thus do not offer employment to OPT students).\n\nThe OPT students who successfully find employment within the three-month deadline through fair competition among all candidates, foreign or native, are proven to be competitive and skillful, and should be granted the opportunity and time to further develop working experience.

This whole tuition burden thing is even more for the International students. The only reason that so many of them are still willing to pay the high price and get educated in the U.S. is because they not only get a degree here, they also get the industrial experience and practical trainings through OPT, which enhance their job competencies and competitiveness in their home countries once they return. If we are no longer granting OPT extension to these students, obtaining higher education in the U.S. would all of a sudden become all of a sudden too much sunk cost, too little foreseeable return, and not so attractive to them. And the truth is, there are more than enough countries out there who are still looking to bring in talented foreign students to help conduct research in higher-ed institutions, work in and enhance the high-tech industry, and last but not least, bring a huge amount of income to just about every industrial sector. And shall the U.S. let go it's OPT extension attraction, countries like Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, even the European countries or Japan/Korea would act quickly and steal these productivity and income-generating talents with their own versions of OPT or other immigration benefits. What would the result be? U.S. universities looking at many empty seats in lecture halls; professors cannot find enough competent and hardworking students to help with research and TA works; shops around college campus taking hit for losing bit chunk of their business, I can go on for a long while.\n\nNow let's take a look at our companies. Both established companies and hot startups in the U.S. are looking to enter foreign markets nowadays, especially large markets like China and India (which also happen to be the two major sources of STEM students in U.S.). OPT extension in such cases will help these companies find and hire the best of foreign STEM talents, and not only use their technical competencies to the companies' product development and operations, but also take advantage of these students' rich understandings of their home market. Take Uber, Google, or Facebook, which are either fighting hard against local competitors or trying to enter long-banned markets. Having a good number of OPT-backed employees speaking on the companies' behalf should definitely help building on positive company reputations in front of local customers and even the governments.

A and B both get jobs during good economy as all the companies are recruiting more people. Then after two or three years, during economic downturn, A still keeps the job but B lost his job. With this new OPT extension proposal, A will have a higher chance of getting H1-B than B. In this way, US gets to keep the talents US really needs instead of just getting those lucky international students.\n\n2. For STEM fields, the new graduates are the main workforce and engine for innovation. 3 years (the more would be better) would actually enable a talented international student to actually make something great happen with the knowledge they learned at school. (For example, some research projects in Tech companies or have a start-up)That is good for international students themselves as they realize their values in US as they might not have those resources back to their home country. It is also good for US'name of attracting talents. Tesla's CEO is also originally from a foreign country. \n\n3. Why OPT extension is good for US citizens: I think it is true that with this influx of newly graduated international students, new graduates of US citizens would have a hard time to find jobs. However, at the same time, it means less competition in managerial roles as large amount of international students are leaving after 3 years. Besides, the argument \"international student taking away jobs from US citizens who are newly graduated from college\" has the assumption that \"the number of jobs is constant.\" This assumption might not hold true. International student also consume, which means a multiplier effect and creates more jobs such as food providers, delivery guys. Especially most of the jobs can actually be hold by older guys whose skill sets are out-dated. The only people who might be negatively affected by this rule is the college new graduates of US-citizens. I understand new graduates have a lot of pressure of paying back student loans, but competition for those new graduates is good for them overall and long-term. After all, they are young and competition might push them to reach a higher goal. Once they pass the intensive 3 years, they become managers and they can manage international students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joe Su", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8287", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree to expand opt for students", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by bruce gu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16689", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "America's prosperity largely relies on the work and contribution of immigrants, especially in technological area.

More students will be willing to pay tuition to get a chance to have a STEM degrees from these institutes, and these institutes therefore will have more funding to develop their education resources, bring better education quality to the public.\n\nStudents who graduate with STEM degrees can have more time to work at U.S. before getting an H1B, and contribute what they have learned from U.S. universities back to U.S. society. \n\nSTEM related industries can benefit from hiring OPT students. Currently, talents shortage problem is serious in STEM industries, especially the IT industry. The industry is growing dramatically and demands talents.

The previous OPT extension with 17 months had been effective for years, but the STEM skills shortage is not eased. Even if the OPT extension is canceled, the STEM talent shortage problem in U.S. will not be resolved by hiring more native STEM talents, since the number native STEM talents is big enough to fill the gap.

I am an international student who just recieved my master degree in Financial Engineering in May 2015.\n\nI list several reasons below to support the new STEM OPT extension.\n\nFirst, compared with european countries, the most attractive aspect of the U.S. is the students can have longer training period after their graduation. It is hard to believe that a plenty of talent students who majir in STEM will still come to the U.S. to study without this new STEM OPT extension.\n\nSecond, based on the first reason, the large amount of students means huge tuition fee and incredle comsuming power. These are nice incentives to the U.S economy. According to the data from Association of International Educators, the international students made more than 26 billion net contribution to the U.S. economy in the 2013 to 2014 academic year. Besides, The foreign students also contribute their creation, knowledge and skills in the academic fields.\n\nLast but not least, standing on the employer's view, normally, the projects or trainings for their international employee are more than one year. It is also hard for them to hire talent foreign students, if there are not enough working time for those employee. It is a huge loss not only for international studednts, but also for a lot of american companies.\n\nIn sum, it is a win-win for the U.S. and the international students to extend the STEM OPT program to 24 months.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xuan Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15070", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "At the heart of this issue is obviously protecting Americans, their wages and jobs. I applaud Washington Tech for standing up against depressed wages. I truly wish that more lawsuits would occur involving unpaid interns. So many employers want free labor and students engage in this work to gain the experience to be competitive in the market place. The trouble is that employers get a taste for free labor and they want more. This is what is truly driving down wages and new hiring for everyone.  There should be enforced limits on unpaid internships and employers should be held accountable. \n\nWith regard to international students, it is extremely important to remember the value that these individuals and their families bring to our country and our economy. First and foremost, is their work ethic, drive and creativity. The ones that make it here are living their dreams to study and work in the land of opportunity. Generally speaking, they are some of the top students you'll find within US universities. This is certainly the case at our school. Secondly, is their contribution to the cultural richness and diversity that makes the US such an incredible nation. These students engage with domestic students and everyone benefits overall from improved communication and cultural skills helpful in the global workforce. \n\nAnd then there is the financial benefit to having international students here: According to NAFSA findings, during the 2013-2014 academic year, \"the 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy.\" \"This is a 8.5% increase in job support and creation, and a nearly 12% increase in dollars contributed to the economy from the previous academic year.\" You can see more about this study here: \nhttp://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/\n\nAs a former DSO and current career adviser for a university with roughly 3,000 international students and 11,000 domestic students, I have seen both the cumbersome paperwork DSO's must already handle daily as well as the way employers shy away from international students due to a lack of understanding about existing work authorization opportunities for F-1 students. Many of our employer partners already state they won't consider internationals, PERIOD. It is really unfair for US universities to attract international students (they all pay full-tuition and cannot take out US loans) under the notion that they will have the opportunity to gain US work experience when we know that employers increasingly won't consider them.  \n\nWhile the new proposed wage protections are good for all workers, the training plans and 6 month check-ins are too cumbersome for most any employer to consider. There is also too cumbersome a burden on DSO's who usually don't have expertise on fields of study or constantly changing academic subjects. They aren't going to have enough knowledge about programs of study to be in a position to approve these plans. \n\nAs a final note, I'll state that we will be driving international students back to take roles outside of the US where more American jobs will be outsourced. If the talent is abroad and it's cheaper there, employers will still hire these folks, only it will be in a place where we have no control over wage standards. With today's technology, the work can be done anywhere.  Don't we want to keep the top minds that we are training here in the U.S. where they continue to drive our economy? These are consumers, tax payers and top minds we are sending away when we include too many burdens on would-be employers who need these workers' talents.\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Brook S.", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4142", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the rule.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n\nThe message from this Regulation is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joel Jamison", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3630", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, how important these four area to USA's economy, development and safety, I think a person with basic common sense can clearly and significantly understand.

It is horrifying to think that after 12 years since Middle school I have spent and worked very hard in the US and landed on my dream job, I have to consider looking for other job in other countries that I have not considered before in the middle of my career.\n\nMy OPT period has started right after my graduation, which leaves my end of OPT date, with the STEM extension, at December of 2016, which will be common to most international students who has graduated from American Universities with STEM degree and has landed in a job in the same field and are working very hard. If I had 7 more months, then all of us get one more chance for the election. If we do not get elected then, we would already have at least 3 years of experience in the field, and we would be on a much better term leaving the country with what we had come in for. In the society where less than 3 years of experience equals to almost nothing, having to leave the country after all we have been through is a little harsh. I fully support the idea and would really hope that this proposal gets passed.\n\nSincerely,\n     Soyoung Yoon", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Soyoung Yoon", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19047", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's really a good decision to extend opt for F1 students.

When they do, they bring with them the understanding of democracy learned from here. Some other students that really excel in their position through hard work may be considered to continue their work. It is the American companies' decision whether or not an international STEM student is worth sponsoring a longer working VISA. Even if the company wants to hire the student for longer terms, the working VISA often may not be approved due to limited openings each year. Rational decision-making would only maintain those that benefits the American company the most.\n\nInternational STEM students are a source of income to American universities. Most of the students self-finance their education, while universities are allowed to charge a higher tuition fee from international students. Only a small portion of students receive any financial support from the US universities. When they do, they are often tax payers.

Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\n \n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\n \n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\n \n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nForeign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nChanging temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students.

What is going on? The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S? Employers use it to get around the H-1B cap. \n\nDHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. \nGiving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65% when they hire foreign students instead of US workers. They don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range?  While costing Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. Stop this asinine practice and place Americans first. Social Security is bankrupt we need workers to fund it for American born retirees.\n\nThe proposed rule is open to every and all the world dregs to come here and take advantage of the American Tax payers hospitality. This Rule does not take into account the intelligence of the applicant or what the applicant can provide to our nation monetarily. By that I mean can the foreign student has the ability to support themselves while attending school. Without taking advantage of the American tax payer.\nThis is unbelievable that we have left this  continue while Americans are suffering. Allowing corporations to take advantage of a loophole that is detrimental to the American people should be closed.\n\n The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. \nIn short, every and any school is a qualifying school.

The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition..I'm fuming to learn while OPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is no-ones definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months. \nThe OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program.

That would have allowed me two chances - April 2014 & April 2015 - to apply for Industrial H1b. At that time that my Ph.D. supervisor was gonna to keep me as a post-doc in the lab for another two years for the sake of helping him train new students and explore new research projects. So I knew I was going to miss the first two chances for H1b application. With all the considerations, I had to delay my graduation till end of 2013, so that my initial OPT started from Nov 2013 and thus my STEM OPT would cover a third chance in April 2016. I am currently working in a company so I am waiting for the industrial H1b lottory in April 2016. Should we have the new rule of 24-month STEM OPT, I wouldn't have to delay my graduation date to end of 2013, which made some differences for me as I was then grouped into the graduate class of 2014 instead of 2013.

Particularly, STEM/professional education demands significant investment of time, money and effort. The transition from the title of 'student' to 'employee' has become extremely taxing, given the current job market. The very same scenario adds an extra challenge if you are an international student, requiring employment sponsorship to qualify for a job.\n\nAs commented by other people in this forum, companies look for professionals ready to start effectively working from day one. On the other hand, students are willing to groom themselves into young professionals by acquiring the necessary training. Internships/apprenticeships (OPT and CPT) are great ways to bridge the gap between the university and an employer. The proposed F1-OPT STEM amendment by DHS is an extremely laudable step towards positively stabilizing the need-supply balance of student-employer dynamics. This 24-month extension will help companies retain their trained workforce as well as provide ample job experience for the trainees. Needless to say, this proposal content by DHS splendidly emphasizes the benefits of this extension to both students as well as the US companies.\n\nMoreover, E-verify limits the students from pursuing many potential opportunities as many major employers in the market are not E-verified. Also, these companies are not willing to participate just for the sake of international students.

For instance, a commenter stated that demand for technical workers was very weak in engineering occupations and growing modestly in computing and mathematics occupations. The same commenter stated that, especially when combined with H-1B, L-1, and other skilled workers, the number of students taking advantage of the STEM OPT extension would distort the domestic labor market. Some commenters specifically stated that employers would prefer to hire F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions because these students would work for lower wages. Some commenters noted that some U.S. firms had previously advertised STEM positions as being available only to OPT students. Commenters requested that DHS consider written reports, testimony, and other sources describing the state of the U.S. STEM workforce. Commenters also questioned the veracity of studies and reports cited in the preamble to the 2008 IFR, and some questioned whether DHS had interpreted that information correctly in assessing the then-prevailing STEM labor market. Some commenters stated that the STEM OPT extension was contrary to the academic purpose of the F-1 statute. In general, commenters who made these and similar points requested that DHS eliminate the STEM OPT extension and the Cap Gap provision in their entirety.\nDHS's initial assessment, consistent with many of the public comments and following consultation with the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor, is that the direct benefit to the academic experience resulting from the STEM OPT extension is significant, and that on the whole, positive indirect effects on educational institutions and academic exchange support the availability of a STEM OPT extension at this time.

The expenditure in these countries for hiring talented students will be much less. This can help these companies reduce their US expenses while still being called American companies. Keeping the students here helps prevent this situation.\n\n3. Many of the students in STEM programs have advanced degrees (MD, PhD, etc.). They have contributed to the research in USA and have helped bring new innovations. Many of these continue to take up Academic jobs in Universities and in turn help the American citizens effectively. Restricting STEM opportunities for PhD, MD level students would be disastrous for the research and innovation in these fields.\n\n4. F1 students are non-immigrants with legal VISA. They work and contribute to the tax system, which benefits all the American citizens. \n\n5. The STEM based OPT students from Computer science fields have joined various start-ups and have created new startups (once they become full citizens). These startups have hired a large number of American citizens and have added jobs to the tally. Many companies such as Whatsapp, Baidu, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. have benefitted from these start-ups in term of acquisitions and job creations. If not given an opportunity to stay in America, these students can create an equivalent competition in their home countries, which can reduce the performance of american companies. Examples of Alibaba (China), FlipKart(India) have not allowed companies like Amazon (USA) to dominate their markets. Similarly, phone companies such as OnePlus, Xiaomi, are based from China and have eaten into companies such as Motorola (USA based).  \n\nAllowing students with advanced degrees to stay in USA and contribute would in turn help the American citizens. As these individuals have legal documents and have not crossed any borders illegally. They pay taxes and live by the law of the land.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yash U", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19717", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the OPT extension policy. First of all, many objection voices come from the conclusion that US already has enough qualified employees right now so they don't need more new fresh faces. However they neglected one fact that this is based on a large amount of employees already in the OPT position who are waiting for winning a luck in H1B lottery. By abandoning the extension, the company could lose many well-trained workers while the short 12-month will be hard for any employer to give a correction evaluation of the new people. In this case, human resources loss will be unavoidable in the near future in most STEM field. Secondly OPT extension provides US education an absolute priority for study abroad. As we all know, the financial contribution from international students largely help the education of local American students. Without this policy, I believe the amount of international students will be significantly reduced, which will be a big loss for US eventually. Last but definitely not the least, US is known as a melting pot, which allows the development of various culture. The OPT extension policy obeys this origin and provides chances and hopes for every new curious face coming to USA to achieve the dreams. I agree that problem of unemployment is challenging for US government, but definitely it won't be fully solved by decreasing the amount of international workers. The OPT extension will bring more advantages from long-term consideration.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ni Fan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19561", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As an international student, I truly know how much this policy means to us: we can apply what we learn to practice and realize our self-values.

Education: with longer OPT duration, a lot more international students will be attracted to America to seek further education. And as we know, the college tuition is a huge amount of money. This will definitely increase education incoming. And a lot of PhD students are sponsored by universities and governments, which means US government will suffer a huge loss if they are kicked out immediately after they graduated.\n\n2. Economy: those international students who can find a job are mostly extremely excellent elites in their fields, because they'll have to be much more outstanding to compete with US citizens. In lots of fields, there are serious shortages of talents and the employers always first consider US citizens. The reason why so many foreigners are working in those fields is they can't find enough Americans to work on it. If employers don't hire international students, these industries will absolutely crash.\n\n3.

Currently many nonimmigrant/international students are being trained in the US in the field of STEM, including a lot with advanced degrees.

In addition, such training will enhance international business tie between globally as more global collaboration is likely to occur once the student return to the home country. More importantly, the extended time period will provide more time for the student to start up a company, which will very likely to increase the job opportunities for the people in the US. Lastly, this expansion will provide better gap for the H1B visa, through which eligible students will transfer more smoothly to the new visa status, which will benefit the US companies a lot.\n\nOn the other hand, because such OPT is still temporary training(up to 3 years), it will not affect the job opportunities for the US citizens significantly. In contrast, it will fill the gap on the market as the US economy needs a lot of people in the field of STEM, which cannot be filled alone by the US citizens. Under the new OPT, the best talents all across the world will be more likely to remain in the US and continue to contribute to the innovation in the US, which is of great value to the US. \n\nIn conclusion, the newly proposed OPT expansion will definitely better benefit US economy as well as the diversity of US and therefore I fully  support the new proposal.\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Hang Ren, University of Michigan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2724", "postedDate": "2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually.

This proposed expansion will ensure that our kids will never be able to find a job again.  In a time where college tuition has become unaffordable and our kids are drowned in student load debt, we are importing hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals to compete for the few available jobs in STEM. \nWhat is amazing to me is that foreign nationals are able to comment on this board in favor of policies that favors them at the expense of American citizens.  It seems that this administration is more concerned about the well-being of everyone except the citizens of the country that elected them.   I guess, that after our politicians received so much campaign donations from Silicon Valley, they have to find a way to pay their big donors by increasing foreign worker visas.\nI have a PhD in a biotechnology related field from Cornell University and a postdoctoral degree from MIT and the job market for me and my colleges has been horrible.  If there is a shortage of STEM workers, how come people with degrees from top universities are not finding jobs?  If there is a need for H1b visas and OPT visas, why are companies so eager to lay off so many workers?  I would guess that companies would be hesitant to loose talented people if they thought that they could not find replacements.  Iven in saturated markets like chemistry and biotech, companies are using lots of h1b and OPT visas.\nCould the use of H1b and OPT visas discourage companies from hiring capable and qualified people that may just need some training?  Is it possible that by flooding the market, our government is taking leverage form the workers and giving all the power to corporations? \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alexis Torres", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10973", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I would like to elaborate the benefits and the shortcomings if this proposal was denied. \nIf the proposed policy was denied: \n1. Many companies concerning the STEM disciplines have to recruit a huge number of employees at a short time to cover the vacancy. The number could be as large as hundreds of thousands. As we know people majoring in STEM disciplines are minority compared to art psychology and economic. A large part of STEM students are from other countries, will the companies recruit enough employees shortly? Who will pay for their lost then? \n2. The US is acclaimed for her freedom and equality, this is a land where every one share the equal right of human, no matter whats his race and ethnicity, no matter his nationality. This impression will be ruined once the proposal is denied. \n3. If you think its good for the American employees majoring in STEM and the US citizens career, you are definitely wrong. Some people may know the Gresham's Law, which is a law briefly stated as bad money drives out good money. The companies, of course, hire the right person that can maximum their benefit, otherwise, why they would pay extra money to sponsorship status of the employees. They will have to hire some people may not be perfect for the positions where the employees on OPT used to work. Its hard to say the latter is better than the OPT people. \n4. Foreign students will drastically decrease. According to the statistics, about half of foreign students go back to their countries after graduation, one third of them will go back after a short term of work in the US, only a tiny ratio of them will stay in the US. However, a short OPT period will damage more peoples interest rather than the tiny part, and lead to the decrease of foreign students.\n\nLets see from the other side, what are the advantages if the new rule is approved?\n1. The world is becoming more and more united and smaller than the past, people are looking for their positions fit for them all over the planet. American people serve in every country, people from every country serve the US. It is according to the optimal allocation of resources, and will benefit the US finally. \n2. The countries where the foreign students were from are trying to get the talented people back, meanwhile the US government is committed to get rid of them? Actually, it is not like what people expect that OPT students robbed the American peoples job. To the opposite, foreigners promote the native workers to work better. The environment will be better with this stimulation.\n3.

There are several benefits that this policy can bring. First, it will continue attracting excellent students from the world to study in the US, and this is good for our economy. The US has the best education system in the world, if the people know that they are allowed to get work experience after graduation, they will have a huge reason to choose the US as the first education place. Second, the companies in the US will have high-quality workers to hire, filling the labors gaps caused by the retirement of baby boomer, as mentioned above. Large portion of students who hold the OPT extension have high degrees, such as Master and PhD, and that will meet the high requirements of the companies who need the specific knowledge. Third, during the students with OPT extension working in the US, they will spend, pay tax, even buy the house and so on, and all of these have positive contribution to our economy and country. \nIn summary, I strongly recommend that the DHS will continue and extend the OPT extension policy\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by David Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14853", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": " For to long the U.S. Government has been overly concerned for foreign workers and immigrants while preventing American citizens from obtaining American jobs. 45% of Americans are unemployed now and the few who are employed are in many cases underemployed.

So to the people who are arguing the STEM students will cause them lose jobs,  at first make sure you are from STEM. \n\nSecondly, if you are really from STEM, i want to say it is fair competition, you cannot expect American government to drive away internationals to guarantee your competitiveness, which is very unwise for the whole country in the global competition environment. If America doesn't try to attract them, they will go to other countries like England, Austria, Canada, Taiwan or China. In the long-term run what is the result? The America as a country will lose its competitiveness finally. Is that what you want? You may not feel the pain instantly, but how about your children, your grandchildren? Have you think about them, can you stop being so selfish and shortsighted? Can you think about your whole country in the long-term run? Can you start working harder, build your expertise and take courage to compete with those STEM students? Stop being lazy and blame the government rules!\n\nAlso, there is always a great need in STEM field. I worked in Software Quality Assurance area in an engineering company in Indiana.

Students like me only have one year of work authorization after graduation, which I would say is too short for a college grad to really learn to apply knowledge gained throughout their many years of learning. In the finance industry where I work in, it takes at least two to three years to for us to establish our knowledge base in what we are doing and be fully equipped with the necessary skills to step up a level in the work place. What really happened is that many foreign students like me are sent back to their home country simply because they were not lucky enough to win the H1B lottery after their OPT expired, which cost not only the students dedication and commitment to the work they were doing, destroyed the consistency in their adaptation of skills, but also cost the employer a lot of resources to find replacement and arrange alternative deployment for the employees. The fact that they were only one or two years in the job means that they were't able to leverage the short experience elsewhere.

At that time, you will lose the excellent high quality students you produced, unless you offer good lure to the high quality students.But what you are going to do is expel the high level intellectuals.Hope you won't regret at that time.\n\nSecond,I want to remind you that is really not benefit for your economic.

If you don't offer anything to attract foreign student, you will lose the position what you have now in the part of aboard study. What's more, there are more and more students will select Germany, France, England, and so on, because the other countries can offer more benefits for the foreign students.

US is a great country with great people who have or should have confidence in competing with people all over the world. Using the law to protect the weakness of mind is a bad bad idea for the sake of this country. If US born Americans in STEM are really competitive and know what is going on, the OPT and its extension has nothing negative on them but stimulating their growth. \n\n2. A lot of Americans think they can do STEM jobs, which I agree. But the problem is there are not enough options for STEM employers when they need STEM students. Using my department (Civil & Environmental Engineering) as an example, professors desperately want Americans to join their research group. Unfortunately, not many Americans submit the application (we are not talking about the qualifications of these applications). So, now the situation becomes, if you don't hire international students, you don't hire. So, it is the choice of US born Americans. You create the problem to STEM employers. If you lose jobs or can't find a job, it is not problem of international students, it might be owing to your choice of your education at the beginning. Note, the situation I am referring may not represent the entire STEM departments, but it is true in my area. \n\n3. The majority of F-1 students who come to US are exceptionally talented and brave. That is why they can be here. They pay rent, they pay taxes and they support the development of the country, if they are hired through OPT. They are not sucking the blood of the country.

Only those who are truly talented will be given H1-B or Permanent Residency, since very few employers are willing to petition the H1-B Visa or Green Card unless the employees have truly contributed a lot to the companies, in which case they can be considered talented and should be kept in the US so they can future contribute to the US economy and technologies.\n\n3.

From the STEM program I am in, there are over 80% students come outside of the States. When we go to top university in the USA, we will find thousands of hundreds of students who study there master degree in the STEM program come outside of USA and they are really good at mathematics, physics, chemistry and so on. For students who come here to study, they will pay high tuition fees, which helps to promote the growth of the universities, helping good universities and colleges to hire more professor, providing greater facilities to serve the students and then the society. \nHere we want to know why more students who are top students in their own countries would like to come to US to study instead of England, Germany or other developed countries. The reason for most students is that USA provide the OPT for these students after their graduate programs so that they can gain experience. If the rule is not passed, more of students would consider whether they would spend a big amount of money to come to USA. They would rather stay at their own country or go to other developed countries to study and spend the money.\nBesides, extending the OPT program to 24 months would benefit US employers. We know that the process to hire a skilled individual is high and important to a prospectus company. If OPT only remains for 1 year, students only learn some knowledge from the company instead of making contribution to the company. However, if the OPT can extend to another 24 months, students who gain the formal training from their employers can start to think deeper and contribute back, which will benefit the company and bring more returns. Furthermore, we know today that there are some great investment opportunities outside the States and many USA companies would like to do business with Internationally. Having trained the people from overseas will help their future negotiations and cooperation, which in the long term, will bring more employment to US local people.\nFor the local economy, international students help the local people to get their rent payment, help the malls to gain more money and local supermarkets to operate more profitable. For students who study and then work for a short period, the monthly rent payment will be $1000 or more per month and this is only for one student. It can be counted as a very large rent payment number if we take that example into account.

All of these will be a huge income for many of public university, and with these income the University can devote more into researching, reduce local American student's fee, and also recruit best professor to improve the education. Thinking about in university, the major in mathematics , engineering or computer science, you will find almost 85% student in these majors come from outside of USA. In other words, if OPT extension is cut off, maybe this will lead about 50% budget reduction in these majors'incomes. Without these budget, maybe you will find these major course will become a really small course , just 5 or 6 students here.\n\nSecondly, as we all know that the STEM degrees stand for the major in mathematics , engineering , science and some basic researching major in university which are the foundation of technology and technology applications in our life. In NASA, and Corporations in Silicon Valley , the international employees are huge part of power in here. If you cut off these, corporations may not find employees who are good at mathematics ,engineering and computer science, that means high salary rate , lower productivity and even move the company outside to other countries. Because they cannot find the residents who hold STEM degrees in local. Business really need such human resource to power the technology in USA. And these international workforce of course will not take the opportunities from local people, even local people always want to take majors in literature , psychology. \n\nThirdly,the reason that USA is powerful in the world is that diversity brings energy , innovations to this country.

TO attract more international students and enable them to contribute to the society, the department of Homeland Security(DHS) announced an expanded list of science, technology, engineering, and math(STEM) designated- degree programs in 2012. There are several psychology programs that are eligible for the OPT extension. Currently industrial and organizational psychology is not officially on the list; however,as far as I know, all around America, this major is very research focused. It will be a big loss for both international students who majored in I/O psychology and the society if our international graduates lose the opportunity to contribute to the American scientific and social development with what we learned just because of the difference of several figures. There are much less international students majored in psychology compared to many other majors. Definitely, international students could bring in psychology multi-cultural insights and more education investment. There are 4 I//O program in Great New York Area now, which is I/O Psychology Program in NYU; Social/ Organizational Psychology program in Teachers' College, Columbia University; I/O Psychology Program in Baruch College, CUNY; I/O Psychology Program in Hofstra University. NYU has taken an initiative in changing the code of their M.A. in I/O psych from 42.2804 to 42.2799. and made it eligible for STEM OPT extension. With more and more international students studying in psychology, especially interested in I/O psychology, I think it's time to bring this problem to public's attention. \n\nI'd like reiterate the necessity of changing I/O psychology major code and make it eligible for OPT extension. \nFirst, it's unfair to claim supporting for research projects for OPT extension on one side, but on the other side exclude our major in list, which is a very research oriented subject.  Attached please find curricula from all four programs in I/O psychology. Almost all of our courses cover research methods, statistics, social psychology, and focus on theories in I/O psychology field. As an I/O psychology major student in hofstra myself, over 80% school works do with literatures, readings, studies and researches. Out of 43 credits required in this 2 years program, only 6 points are for internship training, which is obviously comparable to other STEM major. You can't deny I/O psychology is still much more research oriented though some programs also emphasize practical aspects. Both scientific and practical aspects are crucial for I/O psychology. They are not contradictory. Such a research oriented subjects should be included in STEM in terms of STEM's purpose and equality.\nSecond, because now I/O psychology is now only offering 12 months OPT extension, less and less international students are going to pursue higher degrees in I/O psychology. It definitely has an adverse impact on I/O psychology program development and research. Multicultural environment raises more research topic in workplace psychology research nowadays. America needs more researchers from different cultures to work on it. International students are the major source for this important I/O field. Please don't intimidate those who have a strong desire in I/O research by merely setting  limitations in their OPT. Extra OPT time will definitely attract more international students in I/O psychology field and even promoting other psychology programs' recruitment. This opportunities allows international students to gain more experience in I/O workplace and be more confident in their future career in I/O research. More internal researchers will only benefit I/O psychology development in the long round.\nNeedless to say, education investment from international students is a great incentive for higher education development. Considering most of I/O students are encouraged to get Ph.D degrees. Recruiting more international students will definitely refill the funding gap in current programs.\n\nI believe including industrial and organizational psychology major into STEM is both necessary and beneficial for the society and research development in America, while excluding it is a big loss for both American academia and society.

I can see the rationale of giving foreign students the opportunity to apply the training they have acquired at U.S. institutions of higher learning so that our nation may profit from the investment made into these students' lives.  What is extremely objectionable to me is that it is being used to hinder American citizens who have paid dearly for training believing that they would find jobs in the U.S. to offset the cost of their education and enable them to provide livelihood for themselves and their families, keeping them off welfare and other assistance programs that drain resources from the tax paying citizens of this nation.  I have seen statistics showing that in a four year period, over 400,000 American citizens have been denied jobs in favor of hiring foreign students under the OPT program.  That is unconscionable!  Our first duty is to the needs of our own citizens, particularly in a time of severe economic downturn resulting in thousands of Americans being laid off work.  DHS is actually proposing to give financial incentives to employers who hire foreign students over Americans.

This is erroneously explained by a decrease in gas prices, when the truth is that money stolen from this fund are being used in part to fund a program which in no way benefits the people who gave into the system, It actually benefits people who have only received from our exceptional institutions of higher learning and now will be preferred for jobs over American citizens with the same or better qualifications.  \n\nThese are serious matters to every American citizen and must not be taken lightly.  The decision is ultimately in the hands of the DHS, but it is the moral responsibility of this department of a government \"OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE\" to consider the ramifications of such an act on the very people whose rights this nation's government has a responsibility to protect.  OPT, of itself, is a reasonable program as long as it doesn't inhibit the welfare of the citizens who support the government with their hard earned resources, but an expansion of this program can in no way be acceptable.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Valeta Bush", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3441", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This rule is definitely important and necessary to the economy of United States.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n\nAdmitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by dianwen zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20483", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The 24 months The new 24 months OPT policy is not only helpful for foreign works but also for the U.S high tech companies.

Students from different countries over the world devote themselves contributing to the development of U.S., especially in those area that requires professional training.

We are weak in English, we are weak in social relationship. We are not competing by taking low salary, so I would say, the only reason that any company would hire international students is because they can't find suitable US citizens to fit in their job. Competition might harm those who are not good at their professional skills, but if one domestic student and one international student has similar level of skills then its to see who the company would prefer. Overall, competition will benefit whole U.S. by increasing the average skills of everyone, which will make US economy keep growing.\nReason 4. We can say that United States is the most powerful country in the world. What makes it strong? Because it's open to professionals all over the world.

Here are my reasons.\n\nFirst, new OPT extension rule helps IT companies to avoid unnecessary costs of talents training. Take FLAG(Facebook, Linkedin, Apple, Google) as an examples. These big companies have many training programs for junior engineers, associate designers and product managers, which last for months. The companies invested lots of money and resources in talents training. As a result, every time an employee fails to be selected in H1B lottery and has to leave U.S, it causes great waste and loss to the company they served before. More seriously, if they engaged in developing projects, it's also a big hamper to the project progress. \n\nSecond, new OPT extension rule keeps U.S academic sectors competitive and attractive globally. Compared to academic sectors from U.K, Canada, Singapore, Japan and other countries, one of the biggest advantages of U.S academic sectors except for academic qualities, is the opportunity to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience. However Canada has already improved its working VISA policy and consequently results in rapid increase in the amount of international students. This new OPT rule helps U.S academic sectors to maintain their attraction in global talent competition.\n\nThird, new OPT extension rule benefits United States society. Nowadays, most of core technical talents in high-tech companies and industries come from China and India. Without this OPT extension rule, they could only work in U.S for a year and then it will be a disaster to many high-tech companies and the whole industry. What's more, these foreign STEM talents greatly drive the economic. In 2014, the total consumption of all international students in U.S reached 26.8 billion. They greatly contribute to catering business and housing in America.\n\nHowever, many people are worrying STEM students will take jobs from local students. But it's not true. STEM students could only work in STEM industries so they won's take jobs from other industries like finance, medical and etc.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I highly appreciate the OPT extension and working experience in U.S. The three-year experience will greatly increases my horizon in software industry and contribute a lot to my future career back in China.

Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT:\nFirst, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Second, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nI urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

It is more effective to ban those (perhaps illegal) companies and to check the qualifications for OPT Extension more strictly, instead of arguing for OPT Extension cancellation just based on those few bad examples.\n\nFollowing the above point, the rumor that many companies pay international students lower-than-average wage and hence a lot of American ppl are losing job opportunities is also NOT TRUE. From my knowledge, it is ILLEGAL AND VERY RISKY for companies to against the labor laws to pay such a low wage. I've seen most international students DURING OPT AND OPT EXTENSION are enjoying the same wage rate and benefits as many locals do. Moreover, in almost all job descriptions pages from all companies, it says \"All Candidates have EQUAL OPPORTUNITY\", which means it is NOT the fault of OPT international students who eventually win the interviews and get the job offers. \"AMERICAN FIRST\" somehow also SHOWS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST those more capable international students, which SHOULD NOT be the universal value of USA.\n\nFrom the history, we can see that international students help raise company values and boom the US economy.I see from so many company websites that many senior positions are taken by who are originally international students, which means companies recognize the value and contributions of international students and therefore just reward them accordingly. Also from the past news and papers, a lot of international students are putting their efforts in revolutionary technologies or patents, and hence create values for their employers, which also benefits the US overall. Another important culture value international students can bring is diversity. ALL US firms, schools and institutions encourage diversity instead of kicking international students out. If the OPT Extension Policy is cancelled, nobody can guarantee that those jobless American workers will find a position. If all OPT Extension students have to leave US, I believe this will be a disaster for thousands of companies and some companies may even start laying off US workers as well and make the whole society unstable again, which is not what we want to see.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael Yang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19785", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I believe this is a good measurement to strengthen our country's edge by encouraging talented students working for America instead of going back right after costing our education resources for 2-5 years.

And here are my reasons:\n\n1. OPT students will benefit from this. With extended time OPT student can gain more experience in the related field. And they will have a better chance to build a better career which will impact their entire life. And this will, in the long run, benefit their family, their children and their country. With the time extended they will also have more time to think about the next step, either continue in the industry or pursue a higher degree.\n\n2. OPT students make great contribution to the goverment, their company and even more. I work as a engineer in a tech company. Our team has a total of 7 people and 5 of them are either currently working using their OPT extention or uesed to be working under OPT. They contributes to 70% of the human resources in our team. And each year they can contribute up to 30% of their input to the federal as tax. From our company's perspective without OPT we would spent more time and money trying to recruit qulified employee from our sources or we would end up not having enough skilled engineers to power the whole comany. This great loss for the company means great loss for the customers of the company and our customers could be anybody in the nation. As whole OPT students plays an important role in boosting both the technological and economic development in the U.S.\n\n3. This rule will be a win-win for both existing U.S. citizens and OPT students. Competition does exists but will create a win-win situation as this kind of competition will raise the human resouce quilty in the U.S. Knowing the existence of the competition will help people to realize the need to improve their skill set constently. In the long term this will help to raise the level of the education across the whole country.\n\nFor more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed people from all around the globe, enhancing the diversity, culture and economy. And that is what makes the United States the UNITED STATES. And that is what keeps making it stronger and stronger.

The total number of H1B visa assigned every year would still keep the same even if the OPT (Optional Practical Training) duration extended. This limits the total # of foreign students who would like to stay in US in a long term. As a result, the extension of OPT would actually increase the competition for lottery of H1B among international students themselves. The only potential influence would be the competition among recent US and foreign graduates.\n\n2. Many projects in the STEM industries will last more than 1 year. The extension of OPT provides more tolerance on the project timelines for both employers and employees. Therefore, employers will not need to suffer from the risk and cost of losing qualified workers only due to the limited OPT duration.\n\n3. The proposed rule to expand the OPT program would help build a benign competition among recent graduates. Since the employers would be able to find more qualified and diversified candidates for the work, it incentives the development of the STEM industries and creates more job opportunities in return. The benign competition would also incentive the educational achievements for both foreign and US graduates especially college students. Instead of the malignant competition preventing the job markets to optimize its functional interest, it would be a better choice to set both employers and employees free in finding their best candidates.\n\n4. From the perspective of education industry, the programs in colleges and graduate schools for foreign students have brought high profits in recent years especially in STEM programs. Not only the high educational quality, but also the Optional Practical Training opportunities are also huge attractions that cannot be overlooked. The cancellation of OPT STEM extension would detriment the motivations for foreign talents to study in US colleges.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Steven Jones", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19650", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Making STEM major OPT extension to 24 months is very crucial to both international student and the U.S.\n\nFor international student:\n1.

From my observation, most of the international STEMers work harder when they are employed during the intern programs. When I was doing my summer intern at Applied Medical Inc., I contributed all my knowledge and focused on the work all the time which can be proved by my supervisor.I worked harder and always stayed overtime to study my projects for the goal of gaining more experience to get a better job when I came back to my country. As a result, all my teams were surprised by my design and my design provided a perfect solution for Applied Medical. Thus, if I have more time to legally work in U.S., I could get stronger background for my domestic job hunting and the U.S. high-tech companies could receive a perfect technology solution from me. It's a win-win situation for each other.\n\nOn the other hand, to keep U.S. academic sectors global competitiveness, OPT extension is a fantastic option for U.S. academic circles. I'm from UC Irvine Henry Samueli Engineering School. Why I choose here? I could have chosen Japan where I can also get a better education abroad and close to my hometown-China. Just because U.S. colleges have OPT option and I think the best engineering education comes from work experience. If cancels, I assure that most of Asian students will choose Asian counties for their further study and so do other international students from other continents. In addition, when I was doing my academic projects with my professors, they always complained about the tough financial sponsorship from their department. I believe that it could be perfectly solved by the increase of U.S. academic sector global attraction. \n\nAt last, it is also a fact that the local financial condition can be largely improved by international students input. Take my householder for example, I rented her room for two years during my master program. She told my rent helped her families to get a better life and we finally became a pair of friends. I always help her living problem like how to use smartphone etc. Based on the international students' input, the local company-Irvine Company also gets a great profit from us. They constructed a lot of communities around UC Irvine campus which provide us a big convenience at the same time.\n\nIn conclusion, OPT extension absolutely comes out great profits for all U.S. circles and for us, we are just with the aim of pursing enough foreign working experience so that we can be competitive for our dream positions when we return to our own countries.

If the 17-month extension is shorten or canceled, I will definitely leave my company in 2016 Feburary, which will cause a big problem not only to us but also to my company due to the large international employees who have the same situation as me.\n\nAlso, from another aspect. Before I came to US, I can choose between US and UK. But considering that US will have a lot opportunities for international students to have more trainings, then I decided to came to US. If the 17-month OPT STEM extension can be changed to 24-month. US will be much more attractive to international students, which means more students will come to US and more educational investigation will come to US. I think American people will also benifit from that.For example, my college is in Hoboken, which is a small town in NJ. In my views, a lot of local resturants, local residents and local toursist industry benifit from more and more internatinoal students.\n\nFianlly, some one may say that more international students will take over American people's working opportunities. I think US is a great country where every people with different color can have the same opportunity, rather than a country with monopolism.

I think both US people and international students will benifit from this plan. More and more students will come and appreciate US. This is the responsibility that a great country like US should take.

Opt extension give students more time to become such skilled people, and contribute what they have to the whole country.\nAlso, for education, Universities are now welcome students from other countries, if the opt extension are cancelled, when students think about the choices for university, and the number of students applying for US university may decrease a lot.\nWhen I choose University one year ago, why I choose US is because I know I can have 29 months working time here, and I can use what I learn in really industry.

Until our unemployment issues are solved, and our backlog of current immigrant \nvisa violations is addressed, we do not need to encourage employment of foreign workers.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mary Matthews", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3379", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Good for  US enconomy!

As part of the agile team, I'm responsible for developing creative software solution that helps sales representative in the United States to excel their performance. It'll benefit huge number of people working in the sales domain, and I'm proud of the impact my job will make. Without OPT extension, my output to this meaningful career will be hugely limited, and it'd be such a pity that I can't implement my knowledge set in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and full-stack development further/longer in the US. There are tons of other students in STEM major like me, and we are/ will be making huge contribution to help move forward cutting-edge technology that benefits at least millions of people across the country. We spare no efforts to work hard because we treasure this precious opportunity of being able to work in the US, thus we certainly don't want to stop serving the industry and end up early leaving the country because of no/less OPT extension. \n\nWe help boost the US economy and create job opportunity as well. With this many F1-OPT students in the US, landlords are able to collect/raise their rent frequently due to high demand (especially those areas close to IT firms and graduate schools). For instance, rents in the SF area rises up to at least $3,000 a month and still as tech people we can afford and we will afford the rent because all we want to have is a closer housing to cut the commute hours and work harder. We help boost the travel industry in the US as well. As students with no car at hand, we tend to take public traffic and rides like Uber and Lyft a lot. The hugely increasing demands are served by more and more Uber/Lyft drivers, and us STEM students staying longer in the country will certainly bring them more job opportunities. Meanwhile, relatives and family of STEM students regularly pay visit to the US, touring around the country and make huge amount of purchase in the states, which as well boost the US economy a lot. Moreover, we are no threats to natives in the STEM field, since as native speakers, they are more familiar with the company culture, pace of work and are born great communicators. With similar level of skill sets, I believe tech firms will prefer them to us (international students). Also, the field of IT is still increasing at an amazing speed with greater needs for smart and hardworking people. I believe the extension of OPT is the exact move to accelerate this trend.\n\nWe bring culture diversity to the IT industry in the US. Take myself as an example. I come to the US with a dream to make real contribution to people around me, to make a change in my life path. I used to learn physics during my undergraduate study in China, then struggled to become a skilled software engineer through graduate school in the US. When I worked with my former colleagues (natives), they are often inspired by my perspective/approach to a specific problem due to my background in physics, and it actually turns out to become real profit and a more reliable/stable solution. Thus they value my inputs to the company's engineering problems a lot. My former experience of interning at Japan also brought inspiration when we try to give the company a new name. I believe that there're tons of other STEM students better than me in improving the working environment within their company, and adding to the existing culture in a great way. The voice from different background is actually the key of creativeness and inspiration, and I believe that extension of OPT will bring only good outcome from this perspective.\n\nUnited States has always been a symbol of dream, by making \"the impossible\" possible. Disabling OPT extension for STEM students is like pouring freezing water on passionate people who desperately wants to make a difference/ achieve his/her life goals in the US. We don't want to see the value and reputation of American dream go down since it indeed means a lot to us, and conversely I believe it means a lot to the American people as well. Overall, please approve this beneficial proposal of 24 months extension for STEM major. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhi Li, University of Pennsylvania", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20584", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This must stop.

I am not against foreign workers or immigrants by any means.  However, my family really dislikes the OPT program, after looking it over carefully.  \n   The OPT takes jobs that my sons would love to have, and has denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013. It has also removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which affects millions of American citizens.  That is the problem, it takes resources and jobs from the American people and then the OPT participants do not have to leave.  We simply cannot afford this kind of thing and we must put our own kids' futures first.\n   This proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.  It used to give foreign students extra tools to go back and help their home countries, but nowadays it is used as a bridge to stay in the U.S. and by employers to get around the H-1B cap.\n   Here is what I am reading:\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.  My husband is in IT, and he says that he has seen these foreigners hired because they are cheaper and younger, undermining his job stability and my sons' chances at good IT jobs. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.  How can this be a good thing at this time in our country? They pay no FICA or MEDICARE!  And apparently no Social Security!  This is a travesty.  American workers are disadvantaged by this program for these and several other reasons.  \nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n  In short, this OPT plan is a very bad deal for Americans of working age and my family is tired of seeing such programs as this that favor foreign workers at the expense of our own American people.

Through this proposal, more international students can have the chance to stay in the US and diversify the skills and culture in the country. Meanwhile, they can be given more time to make contribution to the country. I have many friends from other countries who stay here, survive and prosper, become the academic and industry leader finally. Without this kind of proposal, they would have been sent back to their home countries and no more contributions can be made to the US.\n\nSecondly, more diversified people, better technology will be made, and greater the country would be. Some one may suspect that the international students/workers would give more pressure to the domestic students/workers. However, the reality is that, from my experience, we work and study together with the domestic students and support each other. In this way, we grow up together and become more skilled and professional.\n\nThirdly, to the contrary, without this proposal, more and more current workers will be mandatorily sent back to their home country. The population is very large and thus potential social problems will arise. For instance, many of them already married and have children who were born in this country and are US citizens. Furthermore, some of my international friends are engaging with the US citizens. If they have to go back, they may become a risk for the country. More social problems are ongoing.\n\nIn sum, I strongly support this proposal and hope it can be finalized and executed.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kirios Nieto", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12434", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Before became a university staff and got green card, I was also an international student.

However, the out-of-state tuition paid by international students really made contribution to improve the awful financial situation of universities.

International Students.\n2. Employers.\n3. US Government.\n\nLet me describe each of the above benefits.\n\n1. International Students: All over the world, many students have their dream of studying in USA. This is mainly because of the quality of the education the universities in USA provides. But only concern to fulfill their dreams is money. Because of the high tuition fee's the universities have for education, most of the students try very hard to arrange money for the tuition fees and leaving expenses. Even the students spend 20 hours per day to work as part time, student cannot afford complete education tuition fees. Hence most of students takes the help from banks to get education loan and completes their studies. They get the bank loan in a hope that they can pay the money back by working after graduating. Due to high amount of tuition fee, students need to work for minimum of 2-3 years in USA to get the loan. Because of this we the student gets opportunity to work in USA for at least 3 years, he can clear the debts. Because of this more international students will be coming to USA for the education. \n    Along with these, the work permit H1 visa applications are limited to 65000+20000. Recently we have seen around 2200000 applications applied for H1 visa and only 85000 got the visa. So out of 4 applicants only 1 has got the visa. Allowing the students to work for 3 years will make the students less dependent on H1 Visa approvals.\n\n2.  Employers: Many employers are in USA and they need good quality candidates for each of their job roles. Having the student working only for 12 months will not help such companies in long term. Hence companies will loose such quality of employees if this rule is not implemented. This in turn may effect the quality of product and economy of the company. If this rule is not passed, more students will leave to their home country after 12 months which makes the employer have few options in selecting candidate.\n\n3. US Government: More the students work here, more people will be paying tax and US government will have have strong economy resources. Because this rule improves the economy of Universities, Companies and US Government, this rule is definitely a great benefit to USA.\n\nHaving all these above reason, we could see the chain linked between each of these entities. Allowing students tow work for 36 months -> increases more students coming to USA -> Increase the economy of universities -> increase the economy of the companies -> increases the economy of US government. If the rule is not passed, it might have reverse effect which effects many entities. \n\nBy considering all of above reasons which are true according to my knowledge,  I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule to be implemented as soon as possible.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anup Nadig Malathesha", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17295", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Providing OPT extension will make the US economy benefit.

So providing opt means providing the opportunities for companies to keep more qualified alien employees, which will surely benefit the overall US economy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuzhou Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12752", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposal and this proposal will benefit both international students and America.\n\n1. The OPT extension rule will attract far more international students to America. Only a small portion of these students will eventually stay. Most students benefit the US economy by paying a huge amount for housing, tuition, food, service, etc and leave the US after graduation. \n2. The US high-tech industry is driven by admitting highly-skilled foreign workers. In major US universities, there are a large number of foreign faculties. They are dedicated to research and develop new technologies which make the US the most innovative country in the world. US technology giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft rely on highly-skilled international employees to stay on top of the competition. The American-only labour force will not be able to satisfy the need of the Universities and high-tech companies. They need foreign workers to have enough resource to keep the US economy youthful and full of potential. \n3. Some people might believe that OPT extension will allow companies to hire international students for a lower wage which leads to a decrease of benefit and job opportunity for US citizens. However, this is completely not true. US companies are NOT allowed to hire an international student instead of a US citizen for a lower wage. As a matter of fact, it is much harder for an international STEM student to find a job than an American STEM student. International students have cultural and communications barriers which put them at a much lower hand during interviews. Furthermore, most companies prefer American students over international students because they do not want to go through the extremely complicated and unpredictable process of H1b application. Last but most importantly, in order to sponsor an international student, the employer will have to open the job to American citizens first. Only if no suitable American candidate is found can this position be awarded to an international student.\n4. Most highly-educated and intelligent international students in the STEM field rely on the OPT extension to work in the United States. Once they obtain the working visa, they will be able to contribute greatly to the tax income of US government, research and develop cutting-edge technologies and diversify the society. Countries that shut their doors to highly-skilled foreign workers ended up suffering from the stagnation of the economy. America relies on the introduction of foreign workers to continue to be the greatest.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jikai Yin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12504", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n\n1.

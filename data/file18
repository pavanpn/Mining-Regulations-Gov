I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. I am an international student. Before I came to the US, I had chance to go to schools in England, Canada, Singapore etc. when I was applying for schools. I ended up coming to US because I think I have better opportunities to put what I have learned in school into practice due to the OPT STEM extension policy. If the STEM OPT is not extended to 24 months, and even worse, if it will become less than 17 months, the U.S. will not be able to attract international students, or it will attract significantly less international students. Thus, there will be a significant decrease in number of students in the U.S. universities and the U.S. will experience the lack of qualified employees in science, engineering and technology related areas.\n\nThis is also important to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. For many companies, their projects would last at least two years. If the OPT period is too short, employees cannot finish their project and companies will need to spend more money and time to seek for other employees.\n\nIn addition, US employers will benefit a lot from the STEM students. For example, many US companies such as Facebook and Uber are trying to open their markets in other countries. International students can bring more insight knowledge of markets in their home countries, which can benefit both the US companies and US economic in a long run.\nIn general, the extension of 17 months of STEM OPT to 24 months is a win-win situation both for the U.S. and the international students studying in this great country.\n\nThanks!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cora Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14126", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this rule because its very important to allow the students to increase their practical knowledge on their studies.Honestly I support this great decision.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Prashanth Kumar Vuthuru", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0284", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "          The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n              I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.  I believe this will this will in turn create a \"buddy system\" of employers that will solicit more of this type of employees...edging out opportunities for American citizens.  With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nRespectfully,  D.

Please note the following comments.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III A]  I support the proposal by DHS to reinstate the OPT STEM Extension in response to the judgment issued on August 12, 2015 by the U.S. District Court in the case of Washington Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security. I further hope that the final rule, following the period of public comments and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), will be published at least 60 days before the date of vacatur indicated in the courts judgment, i.e., the final rule be published in the Federal Register 60 days before February 12, 2016. This would allow time for review by Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), so that the final rule will take effect by February 12, 2016.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  I support the proposal by DHS to increase the period of OPT STEM Extension from 17 months to 24 months. Further, I also support the proposal to provide an additional OPT STEM Extension of 24 months for earning a second STEM degree of higher educational level. This regulation implies that if an international student on F-1 visa earns a qualifying STEM Masters and Doctoral degree from an accredited U.S. university, he or she would be eligible for a total of 6 years of practical training in their selected area of study. As a result, the student will be able to obtain valuable work experience and STEM skills, which might not be readily available in the home country of the student.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  The proposed rule by DHS requires students and employers to implement a formal Mentoring and Training Plan that would be submitted to the Designated School Official (DSO) before the OPT STEM Extension is granted. Further, every six months, the student is required to provide the DSO with an evaluation of his or her progress towards the training goals agreed upon. While this requirement is made in good faith, I note that there could be several reasons due to which the training goals might change. For example, the employing company might stop working on a project that was expected to increase the participating students STEM skills, and instead, request him or her to work on different project of similar nature. Therefore, the Mentoring and Training Plan must not require the student and employer to be overly specific regarding the training goals, and how progress towards them would be measured, because the projects and opportunities provided to the student might evolve or change with time.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  I support the proposal by DHS to include the 2008 Interim Final Rules (73 FR 18944) Cap-Gap provision, under which the DHS would temporarily extend an F-1 students duration of status and any current employment authorization if the student is a beneficiary of a timely filed H1-B petition and requests a change of status.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B]  I support the transitional measure proposed by DHS to allow a subset of students already on a 17-month OPT STEM Extension to take advantage of the proposed 24-month OPT STEM Extension by requesting the remaining 7 months of employment authorization up to 120 days before the end of the students 17-month OPT STEM Extension period. DHS has estimated that this proposal will benefit up to 18,210 students.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B]  Please clarify that, according to the proposed rule by DHS, if a students 17- month OPT STEM Extension period has begun, or will begin, before the date of vacatur of the 17-month OPT STEM Extension, and the 17-month practical training period is expected to conclude after the date of vacatur, then such students may continue to undergo practical training after the date of vacatur and remain employed until the end of the 17-month OPT STEM Extension period accorded to them.\n\nTo summarize, I strongly support this proposed regulation, and hope that it will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register in a timely manner, without incorporating significant changes. I note that if the final rule does not take effect before the date of vacatur of the current 17-month OPT STEM Extension, up to 34,000 students who are currently taking advantage of this provision will be forced to resign from the current employment and depart the United States.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vinay Krishnan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0013", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "i think itis obviously that Rejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market.

Im writing to express my complete support for extending the STEM OPT extension by 24 months. I briefly listed out the benefits of this new regulation from the perspective of international students, U.S. employers, and U.S. society in the following:\n\nFirst of all, this 24-month extension would give an immediate benefit on the international students who make up more than half of STEM advanced degrees earned at American colleges and universities, according to a study released on June 18, 2015. As we know that in order to continue working in U.S. beyond the OPT time period, the internationals need to get approved with a H-1B visa through the USCIS lottery which has a notoriously high failing rate of 51%. Without the 24-month OPT extension, more than half of international STEM students will be forced to leave the job occupations in U.S. This will not only hurt millions of international STEM students every year, but will likely have a great negative impact on the U.S. colleges and universities, because prospect international student enrollment will be hindered. If they knew that the country that they are going to earn a degree in is not supportive for their career development after graduation, why would they come to earn a degree here paying the expensive tuitions?\n\nSecondly, without the 24-month extension, the U.S. employers would lose millions of well-educated, high-skilled international employees with STEM degrees. It would result in a complete waste of the employers hiring effort and expense, training resources, and most importantly, a great reduction on their talent pool. A huge impact on the overall company performance is likely to be seen, therefore result in a great reduction on their overall productivity and revenue.\n\nLast but not the least, the U.S. society in general will benefit greatly from this new regulation. Diversity and equality are two of the most important factors that make U.S. a strong and beautiful nation today. With open arms to embrace the highly educated, top talent from all over the world, U.S. society will undoubtedly benefit greatly in all aspects including economy, science, technology, and developing even faster to reach a greater goal. It is the great talent that propels the advancement of technology and economy throughout human history. With more and more supportive regulations to encourage the top talent to contribute in U.S. society, U.S. will fly towards a brighter future with strong wings.\n\nThanks so much for your concern and time.\n\nSincerely,\nLaurie Zhang\nGraduate Research Assistant\nUniversity of Washington", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Laurie Zhang, University of Washington", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0185", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We are being taken over by foreigners.

With this extension, US universities and colleges would be much more likely to attract international students, each of whom would spend averagely 25000 dollars on tuition a year in US. Besides, they would also have extra spending on living, shopping, and renting. This kind of spending would stimulate the growth of US economy, not to mention that they would bring relatives to come to US to visit and shop. This adds to the revenue of US touring business and sales business. If there is no benefits like OPT, international students might tend to choose Australia, Canada, New Zealand etc which have better regulations for international students, and they would probably obtain the revenue which could have been gained by US.\n2. This extension would also benefit companies which are in need of selected IT professionals. As the IT industry grows enormously in US, almost all the companies have evolved, and need at least web support. However, the H1B capital has not increased. There exists lots of arguments on whether the number of US STEM students is more than the number of STEM jobs, and this subject, in my opinion, bears little relevance on whether OPT should be granted to foreigners since the ratio ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 in various studies.\nFirst, even the number is larger than that of job postings, it does not mean that the company needs are satisfied. In STEM field, quality is at a lot of occasions more important than quantity. That is to say, companies choose candidates based more on their qualifications, and lots of unqualified candidates is worse than a few qualified candidates. It is not to say that US STEM students are not competent, but they are not all that competent and companies do not have to bear with it.\nSecond, many STEM students ended up working outside STEM fields. After years in STEM, those students find more suitable career paths. So the number of degrees earned does not mean the actual work force.\nThird, companies which choose international students are mostly focusing on international strategies. They truly need people from different areas of the world, and they need the best, not in US, but internationally. Choosing the best people in the world would mean that they can be the best companies in the world. Otherwise, they would not necessarily be the best. Therefore, OPT extension simply provides companies more choices, and if they do wish, they can always choose citizens.\nFourth, companies have every intention to make money. Hiring foreigners means that they have to go through legal procedures, which is costly. If citizens would do the work, they have no need to hire foreigners. It also rebuts the claim that foreign workers are cheap so they are hired.\n3.This extension also bears moral and humanistic meanings. As we are all aware, the former OPT regulation is becoming obsolete in February 2016. However, lots of graduate students have already obtained permission from DHS to work longer than February 2016. If this extension does not pass, it means next February millions of students have to leave because US changes its mind.

To keep them working for the US is significantly important to maintain our lead in technical and scientific areas and to compete against the emerging power like China. We would not want to see these future field-leaders go back with the technology and experience gained here to benefit their own countries. Never! This will absolutely dampen our economy and global competence in the long run. 2. the major objection seems to stem from the fear that the international students will take American's jobs. This is really absurd. Can you show me any evidence that international students is taking jobs from US students in the STEM field? OPT is meant to fill out the deficit in the need for STEM talents. We are so desperate looking for qualified people and the supply from US students is far from enough. 3.Even competition does occur sometimes, as far as I know the company will always prefer domestic candidates over international students if they are equally qualified. 4. can anyone tell me who havent been children or grandchildren of immigrants, like those from Europe? We ourselves are offspring of immigrants and why we now have such big issues of being a little big generous to other immigrants, especially those international students who are truly talents and would benefit our country?

Competition helps our great country to hire and get the most brilliant talents in the world and makes the U.S. a better and stronger country in the world. So why do we want to push them away and give these talents to our competitors such as China and Germany?

Since these students have proven themselves in the work environment with their potential during their approved 17 month extension they should get a waiver from the proposed Mentoring and Training Plan if it becomes part of the final rule.\n\nAs stated in the section 'Safeguarding U.S. Workers Through Measures Consistent With Labor Market Protections' and being  STEM graduate who had benefited from the vacated 17 month extension I believe that US citizens and STEM graduates are treated equally by employers with job responsibilities, compensation and benefits. From my experience and those around me I have not come across a STEM graduate being employed in place of a US citizen for accepting less compensation.\n\nI firmly support the proposals towards the STEM graduate program and the contribution these graduates can make towards the economy of the United States. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vignesh Swaminathan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0778", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Expanding OPT is a good way for American high-tech companies to hire more employees easier.

F-1 students have always been a great population in supporting the science and technology fields of US. However, it has been hard for students to pursue a chance to get optional training because of their student status even given a 12 months period. The expansion of the OPT extension period to a 24 months will be a great support to these students who want to get some training after getting the degrees in STEM fields. Therefore, I hope this decision can be approved!\n \nI fully support this regulation. America's economy significantly relies on high-tech industry. One of the most important factors that America has world's first class high tech companies is that it has access to world's brightest elites. I work for a famous high tech company in silicon valley and I have numerous colleagues who are from different countries. They are all smart, nice and hard working. Without them, I can't imagine the company being same great. Some people oppose to the regulation because they think having too many immigrants will lower the wages of employees but this is not the case. If you come to silicon valley, you will know how much a company is willing to pay for a talented people and how hard it is for them to find one. There are too few rather than too many talents to support this industry.\n\nGiven the current H1B situation, many talented people are forced to leave the country when they lose the lottery. How can those high tech companies continue to be advanced if they can't hire the most talented people? These people are irreplaceable and they are NEEDED for high tech industry. Therefore I will strongly support this rule.\n\nExtending it further to 36 months would be great . It improves the professional experience of international students working in the United States. I strongly support this and a 36 month STEM OPT extension could be much better. If students got more time in their opt then most of the companies would likely apply for green cards directly and that would make sure the talented and experienced people could stay in United States which is necessary for creating more jobs and generating income to United States.Also this would reduce the competition for the H1-B visa lottery.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Akshay Mittal", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5156", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "With 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S., 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs, and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs, American (tax payers) are obviously getting the raw end of the bargain. \nHow exactly does this program benefit the American, tax paying Middle Class?\nEmployers obviously have incentives to take advantage of this ridiculous program.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Nathan Halabrin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4155", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support STEM F-1 OPT extension.\n\nAs a software engineer in Indeed.com, I help people get jobs.

For direct development of the US technology and economics.\n(1) The policy of OPT and its STEM extension is definitely an advantage to attract elite students from all over the world.\n(2) At the period of OPT w/ext, international students are contributing to the US using what they have learned at school, by helping large numbers of companies in various area: IT, Hardware/Software, Health care, Insurance, Financial, Agricultural and Industrial.\n(3) Lots of companies have already been relying on international students for their development --- not only current OPT students, but also H1-B employees (remember they used to be OPT status as well), and even future OPT employees (outstanding on-campus international students have great potential and are certainly the target of those companies).\nB. For indirect development of many domestic fields.\n(4) The policy of OPT w/ext attracts international students to come to the US for study as well as a period of time to work. During that period, their living requirements bring attractive potential to Domestic/Civil development as well.\n(5) A few examples: They need to live, which benefits the real estate field; they need to eat, which benefits the restaurant field; they need to wear clothes, which benefits the manufacturing field; they need to travel for entertainment, which benefits the tourism.\nC. For all international students' co-benefits including myself.\n(6) As an international student myself, I'm currently in OPT extension status and working for one of the most famous banks here in the US. The project I'm working on will last for at least two years. If OPT extension policy were revoked, I would have to leave immediately, which would cause my bank direct inconvenience and great loss for myself as well.\n(7) For future consideration, if OPT extension policy were revoked, I believe that tons of my younger fellow students would no longer consider studying in the US. Instead, they might turn to countries who provide better training opportunities, like the UK, New Zealand, France, Germany, Canada, etc, which may have foreseen disadvantage for the development of the US.\n(8) In conclusion, having OPT extension expanded, we gain knowledge, we practiced it by working, we earned money; the US got lots of work force, got technology and economics (actually most of the fields) developed.

This proposal focus on the STEM industries, which grow very fast and have a large amount of job openings that it is hard to find the right candidates to fit in. For example, one of the biggest IT companies in the world, Google, has 2062 job openings and at least 95% of these positions are STEM relative positions. For a lot of companies, no matter they are IT companies or in other industries, no matter they are large-size company or small size, they all have the similar situation--A lot of STEM positions are open but it is harder and harder to find good candidates for them. These companies all play very important roles in and make huge impact to American economy. \n\nFor a company, If it continues to have this problem--it is hard to find right candidates for the openings, its growth and development will slow down or even the business will fail eventually. For an industry, if this problem continues and expands, the whole industry will stop developing and start  falling apart. If this kind of depression happens in a lot of companies and across many industries, there will be another really long and harmful winter for American's winter. At that time, large amounts of companies will close their business, which cause millions of people lost their jobs. \n\nBut if this proposal is effective successfully, it will solve this problem and bring a big positive impact to the companies who are lack of candidates. It will help them to grow faster, healthier and more strongly. At the same time, they will create more job positions for Americans and are more willing to pay higher salaries. \n\nThus, I think supporting this proposal and making it effective is extremely important for U.S, to keep  the rise of its economy and also the development of the companies.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Che Ayya", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15266", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Support!\n24 months extension provides more opportunities for both students and the companies.

If the STEM OPT extension is canceled, it would make it much harder to gain enough experience after we graduate, and much fewer students from abroad will consider an academic program in the United States, especially those STEM programs. \n\nWith a lot of competitive international students coming to the US, the academic programs in the US are constantly exposed to talented students from all over the world and their different perspectives, which is really important for the general creativity of the academia.\n\nFor myself, I really hope that this extension will be supported by more and more people, since it will enable me to get some experience in the United States for a few years before I go back to China, which can make me more competitive in Chinese job market. If the OPT extension is canceled, future international students will take that into consideration when applying for academic programs in the US.\n\nSTEM OPT extension is not only beneficial to international students, it also contributes to the growth of the US economy. With more international students studying and traning in the US, there will be more demand for housing(rent), food(restaurant), electronic devices and softwares(APPLE laptops and Microsoft softwares), transportation(Subway, Buses, American Airline, Car Companies) and all sorts of other things. These demand can help drive the US economy and create more jobs.\n\nMoreover, US companies such as Uber that want to enter the Chinese market or other countries can benefit from the market knowledge and cultural understanding of international students and use these resources properly to contribute to their profit and strategic goals.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Hongchen Luo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7668", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree with new rule.

Their product is changing the way we live, helping us to know more information (Google, Twitter), get in touch with new/old friends (Facebook) and provide more convenient way to travel (Uber). But to achieve that, they need ENGINEERs, and there is a lacking of engineers right now in California. In contrast, many students of OPT STEM majors are qualified engineers, they are smart, passionate, and willing to make this country a better place by building great product. Without them, many tech companies can't even run their business since they can't hire enough engineers. To make it worse, since the probability of getting H1B visa is getting lower and lower every year, if the OPT STEM is revoked, then most students will doom to go back to their homeland after 1 year of their graduation. Right after they are familiar with their work, learned the skills to work efficiently and ready to make greater contribution to the company or even to the country, they will have to go back home. Or they might even decide to study in a different country (e.g. Australia) if that provides them with higher possibility to stay in that country after graduation.\n\nIn short, there is no doubt that 24 months OPT STEM extension can boost the economy of this country, improve the qualify of our life, and make America stronger and more competitive in the world.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiao Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1421", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Apparently such extension is necessary to boost US economy.\n\nA lot of funded projects usually run for about 3 to 4 years and my company has been involved in some of those.

Firstly, I don't agree that the extension of opt would make companies tend to hire international students than US students. The reasoning that companies would like to hire international students because of less  payment has no evidence to support it. First most opt students are working as intern and of course might be paid lower than full-time workers. On the other hand, the payment to interns are the same for both international students and US students based on my experience and the information from others. Actually most company would like hire US students if both international students and US students are qualified. Secondly, I see a lots of benefit for US from the OPT extension. From the academic view, the OPT extension that enables students to gain working experience attract most elites to US. These intelligent students have made significant contributions to academic researches and thus make US the center of the world in academic area. Academic researches also play an important role to drive the growth of economy as we can see from history. Thirdly, the economic effect from international students is very huge.

The policy is beneficial to international students, STEM field companies and American economy, more importantly it is in accordance with the spirits of United States. \n\nSome comments is arguing about this is using the tax payers' money to support foreign students. This argument is totally on the opposite of facts. In fact most of the international students pay their tuitions in full compared to their American classmates pay way less, especially for in state students in a public school. A lot of universities even intentionally admit more international student to support domestic students and support the researches conducted since international students would pay more for their education. It is very reasonable to provide practice trainings for the full paid international students for them to gain experiences and gain advantage in their own countries' job market. At the same time, due to the lack of STEM professionals in US, the students are also necessary to US. \n\nFor those who think the policy is giving the job opportunities to foreigners, I would say, it is not the policy but people's competence that gives the jobs to foreigners. However, most of the employees in STEM field are still Americans. The companies would hire students for their knowledge and special skills. In fact, if the students are later sponsored by their employer for H1B visa, it means the student has special skills that the company would pay even more on supporting student's H1B status. The competition is always a great way to foster economy and because of the diversity the ethnics and US's open policy for immigrants, could US be the No.1 in the world. The short vision of thinking forbid internationals students to work in US would lead to less and less international students to study and work in US. Since the students who are capable of surviving in highly competitive admission process of top universities in US, this would hamper the leading position of US in education, technology, science, engineering and economy. The people who argue about job opportunities, I would deem, care more about themselves than this country, and just boasting an outdated parochialism.\n\nMoreover, the intentional discrimination of citizens and foreigners is quite unjustified since to this land, except for the descendants of native Americans, every one is a foreigner at some time in history.

As we all know, the US is playing a leading role in such areas than other countries, whatever in aerospace, automotive/electronic/bio-medical/chemical research, internet technology, and so on. We may ask ourselves what is the reason for that? The most important thing is the US is open to great people all over the world and provides good research environment for development and growth. \n\nAn obvious issue is how companies identify excellent graduates? A good practical training program is essential. The length of the training program itself does not have to be very long, but there are more and more graduates have to participate in the annual H1b petition (since many of them are accumulated from previous years) which makes a longer extension for OPT in STEM area necessary and urgent since there is a potential loss of elites. Some opponents think a longer extension will lead to an intense competition in the job market of native Americans? Is it true? On the first sight, yes, it is. But if you think carefully you will get to the other way. First, only those outstanding graduates who uses this program can stay, while the other who could not survive in the market competition will be back to their home country. The people who stay have already contributed to the development of industry: they work hard, they pay for taxes, and they makes our lives more convenient through their jobs. Will you send them back to their home country and spend more money to hire and train a new employee? Of course, a wise person will definitely not do this since it is a waste of \"everything\". Second, the job market is fair for everyone. People use their knowledge to find a job. If there is a more appropriate person in front of a position, why should we use the other? Thirdly, a good competition environment can stimulate people to discover their potentials and study/work harder. Isn't it a great thing? Last but not the end, the origin of the US is uniting all kinds of cultures to build a great place for her people. If she closes doors to diversity outside, how can it be united? How can it be more creative? And how can it be great in the long run?\n\nAs a summary, I strongly support the 24-month OPT extension. We all must be aware that the problem right now is finding ways to create more job opportunities other than leaving foreign graduates out of the door. Another thing is to make the job market fair and provide equal opportunity to everyone by controlling and preventing illegal competitions.

As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree from Johns Hopkins University and graduated with a master's degree of Computer Science. Currently I am working for Amazon.com as an engineer using my 12-month OPT working permit. There are a few reasons that STEM OPT should be extended with 24 months. \n\n 1. With a good OPT policy, United States will be able to keep attracting global talents to study in U.S. One important reason I chose to pursue a master degree here is because U.S. provides great OPT plan so that I can gain practical skills after graduation. This would directly benefit with U.S. high tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. With talents from all over the world, these companies are able to thrive in this era of information. \n\n2. Currently I am working on a few projects in the company. I am the direct responsible engineer for a few of them. In industry, one project typically has a lifecycle of two to three years. If STEM OPT program will be terminated, I think it will cause lots of trouble for the company to find another person to train and let him work on it. \n\n3. I do not think OPT extension program will affect US citizens to find jobs. Personally, I will go back to my home country after I gain enough experience here in the US. I believe three years will be a good timing for me to practice enough. Before then, I would like to contribute my knowledge to US high-tech companies. \n \n4. As a fresh graduate, I am always trying to be innovative and come up with new ideas in my daily work. All these new ideas are improving people's life in this country and generating more job opportunities within and outside of the company. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe STEM OPT extension policy will benefit US economy, long-term development of US high-tech companies, and keep US universities attractive to best talents around the world. \n\nThanks.

The reasons are:\n1. We live in an information society which is built on STEM and these highly educated STEM students can surely help us build it better.\n\n2. We are in a shortage of STEM talents. As far as I know all technology companies, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Intel, etc., partially rely on F-1 students with OPT. The abscess of this rule will seriously hurt those companies by making it even harder to recruit employees they desire, which will raise unhealthy and unnecessary competition on employee resource. And it would be impossible for startup IT companies to recruit high-quality STEM talents - those huge companies are likely able to pay much higher. Innovation in this nation will slow down without fresh startup companies and we won't be able to stay at top of information technology.\n\n3. Universities in U.S. have one of the best STEM education in the world. It makes sense to keep these talents in our nation rather than sending them to other countries -- sometimes enemy countries.\n\n4. Universities rely on international students as well. Their tuition fee has supported our education system. According to NY times -- \"This is the University of Washingtons new math: 18 percent of its freshmen come from abroad, most from China. Each pays tuition of $28,059, about three times as much as students from Washington State. And that, according to the dean of admissions, is how low-income Washingtonians  more than a quarter of the class  get a free ride.\". The absence of OPT extension rule will also prevent international students from applying U.S. universities because OPT is an important reason that they are choosing U.S.\n\n5. We don't lose anything by offering this OPT extension. Those international students with Master's Degree usually work hard and can hardly have negative impact to our society.\n\n6. One may argue that these international students compete with our citizens on jobs and thus lower the salary. That is not true. STEM jobs are well paid, which means we don't have enough STEM people.

Every department, tech or non-tech, marketing or sale, I can see an immigrant working hard for his American dream just like me. However, year by year, it is getting harder and harder for a STEM degree student to get a working VISA from petition. This year, only 6 out of 10 master or above degree student get a working visa and only 3 out of 10 bachelor degree student can get a working visa.\n\nWith the current 17-month extension, I would say a lot of my hard-working fellas in my company, in fact it also includes me, would have to face the destiny to quit job no matter how big contribution we have made to our company.  On the other hand, my employer, would have to constantly deal with brain drain. Only this time the brain drain does not come from competitors, but from an outdated immigration policy. \n\nI have seen a lot of oppositions for this proposal. The main argument they propose is that, immigrants took most of the job opportunities from native Americans. But the truth is, we didn't steal the jobs from native Americans, we took the jobs THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS DON'T LIKE. Anyone who learned a STEM major in any university would find foreign students always takes a large portion in the STEM departments. And the same situation happens in STEM career fairs, interviews. IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT COMPETING AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS, IMMIGRANTS ARE COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER! And the competition is only to become more and more brutal had F-1 OPT extension not going to expand. \n\nI hope anyone who is involved in making this decision would take a rational view on how much impact immigrants have made to the US. United States is a great country because it opens up opportunities to everyone, equally despite gender, race and origin.

A lot of high tech companies performing cutting-edge researches need to hire high-educated employees. Of course they prefer US citizens at the first place, but the fact is that they cannot find a qualified US-citizen but have to hire a foreigner.  \n\nOver the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhuoru Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13692", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this regulation for the following reasons:\n\n1.

I'm an international applied mathematics major with actuarial concentration student from China and currently Im a business system analyst in a bank. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my bachelor degree such as US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents like me. Without this OPT extension rule, I do not believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. Furthermore, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech and data companies, such as Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nI think that 12 months regular plus 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at DePaul University, most large data mining/research development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China.

On contrary, American students have the opportunities to get trained and find a job in any fields (including STEM) without any time or field restrictions. This regulation doesn't require companies to select F1 students over American students. It just provides F1 students with a little more grace in time for training or getting approved to contribute to the US companies and economy.

It may happen in some cases. But F1 students are well trained as American students, and I've seen some of them left their jobs in the US for jobs elsewhere which pay them what they think they deserve. I don't think top F1 students would want to settle for less, even if the job is in the US. On the other hand, I don't think companies would want to hire people who are less qualified for the job with less money. Also many companies stated clearly that they prefer US citizens over F1 students. So it's hard to say that F1 students are the ones who steal American students' jobs, because they got paid less. I would like to think that the students who are better prepared for the job or more qualified took the job, which can be a good thing for the industry and economy.\n\nI think the regulation has more positive impacts, as it makes the US a preferable place for top F1 students to stay and contribute what they've learned in the US to the US.

I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2014 with a masters degree in the field of Computer Science. My company has applied the H-1B visa this April for me, but without luck, I didn't get it in the lottery. However, I have been approved for 17 months OPT extension. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, I will have to leave the United States in next February, and cannot catch the H-1B visa application filing period. It would be a huge disappointment and caused a lot of troubles to me. I was very glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. \n\nThis OPT STEM Extension not only benefits all of STEM Graduates, but also the U.S. academic sectors. I have been in this practical training period for more than one year, and worked for several companies. This experiential learning allows me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates should be given more opportunities to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields. The additional OPT time will provide us with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits encourage many international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. academic sectors and companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension will also Benefit the STEM Employers. Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. Moreover, it costs a lot to train new employees, especially new graduates. With just 12 months practical training, the new graduates may just be well trained, and ready for the work, but have to leave the company. It is certainly a loss to these companies. \n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. The STEM graduates can make better and more contributions to their companies after the training in this period, and these companies can assign them more challenging projects, which helps fuel the company, and further fuel the economy. \n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa. \n\nMany opponents argued that these foreign students will take the jobs from the native-born workers. They may indeed affect the employment opportunities for these native-born workers in a short run, but in the long run, these students with advanced educations and skills help them build and expand the economy. They make the US economy more competitive in the global, and create new jobs and new opportunities for all. \n\nWith all of the benefits discussed above, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sherwin C.", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8237", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This proposal is great!

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, considering the lottery status of H1B, its highly possible that graduated students will not be able to get H1B before their OPT expires, and hence, a lot of companies may not hire international students considering their maximum working period could be one year only, which is not enough for them to take responsibilities in any major projects. But there are far from enough native students or workers that can qualify the standard of cutting-edge IT or related companies. So this will eventually harm the development of the IT and related industry of United States, and will lead to fewer position for native workers too. This is alose-lose situation, and can be avoided with a 36 month OPT! \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. The OPT will allow me to apply what I have learnt in classroom into real world, and develop my skills in professional environment. 12 month is not enough for students to gain a clear view about an industry or their own career path. We need additional time to prepare use both on skill level and on professional soft skills. Extended OPT will attract more international students coming here, making contributions to various industries in this country, helping US companies to maintain their competence and leading position with a source of high quality employers. \n\nOne of the reasons that many of my classmates, including me, come here to study is that we will have the opportunity to work for best companies in the world. If those companies cant hire enough outstanding candidates here, they may have to expand their oversee offices, and find candidates in other countries. Is this the expected result for native workers? We, before and after graduation will help boosting the economy of US as long as we are offered legal opportunities to work here. Otherwise, much fewer students would come in the first place, and all the expenses they could have made here would be redirected to their homeland or other countries, which could be a loss for US and also a loss for students as we may miss a wonderful experience here.\n\nBy all means, 36 month OPT is a rule that can benefit international students, US companies, US economy and US native workers. There is no harm of implementing it, but a tons of benefits. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nSilvia\n\n \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Silvia Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16564", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Opt extension rule is absolutely beneficial for US government, U.S. Company and U.S. People.

Finding a job should depends on the guys TRUE professional ability and technical skills. People should rather compete on a same platform, NOT just rely on things like REGIONAL PROTECTION policy. We couldnt discriminate them just because they are foreigners. The best way is to improve ourselves! Now under the globalization circumstance, no one can stay in a place that is free from competition but can still get great welfare. The regional protection policy will be harmful to the nations development and economy in the long time! \n\n\n2. Those guys who get STEM degree are the ELITE with higher education and professional technology. If we lose the guys like them, this will be a GREAT LOSE to the nation. Say, they get the knowledge from here and then go back to their homeland, they will contribute to the economy of their countries. Take a look at High-tech company, such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. They contribute a lot to USs economy and provide so many job opportunities. Now it's the time when economy depends a lot on High-Technology Revolution. Also, a lot of the CEOs are from India. They all did very great job. If we lose people like them, then they will go back and develop India. not the United Status!  \n\n\n3. I understand that F1 students may increase the competition in the short run, but we still need to think more about it from the long run. Competition is NOT a bad thing. Why are we afraid of competition? It has at least 2 advantages: \n\n(1) This can prompt people to get more professional skills and become better to find a job. I dont think employing guys like some apples of Sodom would be a very good thing to the corporation. We need people that have true abilities, such as the guys with STEM degrees. \n\n(2) If F1 students can urge the job market to be more competitive, and people will struggle to get more professional technology, then we can do the job even better! Then the companies and corporations  develop better and bigger, they can provide much more job opportunities than before! Finally there will be more and more opportunities which everyone can benefit from this. It can also decrease the unemployment rate. The economy of the US can become better and provide better welfares to all the citizens! \n\n\nLast but not least, United Status should be a place that welcome everyone has an American Dream, including those foreign elites with STEM degrees, not a place that refuse competition and prominent guys!

Based on my research experiences, most large research or software development projects would take at lease 2 years or more. If the OPT extension is too short, foreign STEM workers would lose their VISA before the completion of projects. That will be an immeasurable loss for the research project and the companies.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Siqi Fan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18842", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n\n1.

With an extended practical training session, international students could have a chance to get this experiential learning to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. \nFurthermore, the majority of the students with STEM degree works for US Fortune 500 tech companies after graduation ans has contributed their efforts to the US economy, especially the recovery from 2008-2009 recession. As we can see, companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, etc are leading the innovation and driving the economic value of technology. Without foreign workers, this could not be achieved in such a fast pace. \n\nOn top of that,  the duration of the STEM Extension should be 24 Months in order to be a meaningful learning experience. This will allow international students to support key long-term corporate projects and add more value to the company.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chao Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12428", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this rule. its a great rule to improve economy", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Aron Finch", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5237", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is wrong to give the jobs of American citizens to foreign workers Please do not put more American people out of work just because immigrants will do it cheaper and also take money from the Social Security System.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Seaford", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8761", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Student is necessary.\nBecause there are too many jobs about science, technology, engineering, mathematics which not too many skilled people or individuals who have experience about these subjects do not want to do.

During the second Bush Administration, an additional 17 month extension was added in cases where the F-1 visa holder works in a STEM field. The program was further expanded under the Obama administration where the numbers increased sharply. The total number number of participants in the program increased more than 34%, from 73,849 to 99,143, between 2009-2013.\n\nAccording to CIS, since these foreign college grads are defined by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as \"students\", neither the employer nor the alien has to pay payroll taxes, which are mandated on resident workers and their employers.

I strongly support this rules for expanding training opportunities for F-1 Students with STEM degrees. \n\nFirst, collaboration is critical in the STEM field, which will eventually create more job opportunities for both US students and international students. For example, in the area of public health, especially in the field of International Health, there is plenty of long-term collaborative research ongoing in Africa and Asia, which aimed to investigate the natural history of infectious disease and chronic diseases. As US-based liaison, international graduates with extensive perspectives in the culture and customs of both home country and United States, have been actively involved in these research studies. If international students have the expanded training opportunities, they will be able to be involved in the entire process of the research, which usually takes several years, and to help the implementation of the research projects internationally. These research results have and will continue to shred light on the disease prevention and treatment world wide, which have been used to guide further research projects, policy making, and cure development. Consequently, the success of these international collaborative research projects will bring in enormous job opportunities such as in pharmaceutical companies, non-profit organizations, and research-oriented universities for both US students and international students.\n\nSecond, the economic boost from international students both before and after graduation have been tremendous. For example, it is very common for international students to either take a break to visit home country or to have family members come to visit them in US. This active international travel will bring in plenty of potential in the Services sectors, such as hospitality industry/tourism, entertainment, and investment management. Thus, with more opportunities available for students with STEM degrees, US economic status, especially in the service industry will be more prosperous. \n\nThird, this rule helps to maintain and strengthen the current culture diversity in America, which has been emphasized in US. through the decades. International students are more likely to pursue further studies in US at the first place where culture diversity and self-identity is widely valued as compared to other countries. Moreover, the possibility that international students will stay and continue to work after graduation is higher given that this rule is passed. Therefore, the diversity will be strengthened both among the student-level population, as well as among the workforce. \n\nTo summary, with this expanded training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees, there will be more job opportunities available for both US students and nonimmigrant students, as well as continuing improvements in the service industry, meanwhile, the culture diversity will be valued and strengthened. Therefore, I strongly support this rules for expanding training opportunities for F-1 Students with STEM degrees. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12806", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.

Roughly, 20% of graduates find permanent positions in Architectural firms, with the remainder finding only temporary work, or finding in work in an unrelated field. This OTP program makes it that much more difficult for American graduates to find gainful employment in their chosen fields. When will you, our elected officials, and those of you who work for American taxpayers start standing up for citizens instead of trying to bring more and more, unneeded foreigners into this country, in effect stealing jobs from citizens? It is not fair, it is not right, and not a single one of you who support this practice deserve the jobs you currently have. Would you still support this program if it were your job that was going to be filled, leaving you unemployed? The Disney scandal brought to light exactly what  can come of this program. Thise employees that were displaced have still not been given their jobs back, or been able to find work elsewhere. This program has never been approved by Congress and basically provides an avenue for F-1 Visa holders to renege on their agreements (as I understand it, F-1 Visa holders are NOT allowed to hold a job here in the US, and promise to LEAVE the country within 60 days of completing their coursework. The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years.

Opening up more training opportunities will help more companies benefit from hiring international employees and help boosting economy of the country.\n\nFor students, they simply did not pay such expensive tuition to just get half of education, without proper training opportunities.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Regine Ning", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20944", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the extension and believe that the proposal can help US companies to avoid additional hiring costs. Using myself as an example - my employer has agreed to offer me a full time job relevant to the practice of Mathematics after I graduate in April.  This decision was made before the change and it will be a huge loss to both myself and my employer as the program is designated to be two years.  There are thousands of financial services firms, IT firms, and research programs that have extended the full time job offers prior to the ruling, and therefore it will be a huge loss to those US firms should they go through the hiring process again next year.  In addition, I also want to argue that a lot of the evidence used to negate the STEM OPT Extension is more like fallacy in the other part of the labor system.  First of all, about hiring international students will drive down the wages - according to the rule, employers can only hire an international citizen unless there are no suitable US candidates, and the hiring notice is required to be shown public in the firm before the decision, i.e. everyone is notified that there's no other way but fill the opening using a non-US citizen.  If a firm chooses to use lower wage to discriminate candidates, then this is not allowed by the hiring process mentioned above, and should this happen, it is against the labor law and OPT extension should not be questioned to be responsible for the wrong doing.  Second, STEM OPT Extension has nothing to do with limiting the opportunities of US citizen with a STEM major degree.  As I mentioned above, hiring a non-US citizen is only allowed when the position has no suitable US candidate.  Using the same logic, it can be indicated that in fact there is still a huge lack of STEM talents nationwide should these positions still be open.  Finally, I would suggest my fellow US citizens who opposed the proposal argue in front of the right delegations to express their complaints on low wages and unemployment rate.

Please refer to the attachments). For U.S. total GDP, 11.9% came from Education and Health Care, 19.6% from Government, 12.9% from Real estate and rental and leasing, 6.6% from Durable goods manufacturing, 6.0% from non-durable manufacturing, 8.3% from retail and wholesale trade, and 10.2% from Arts & Entertainment, Construction and Transportation. All above sectors contributed a WHOLE 63.6% of US Economy. At the same time, all these foreign students majoring in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) are the customers, instead of competitors for employees of these industries. THEY CREATED DEMAND. AND THE DEMAND THEY CREATED GIVE US WORKERS JOB OPPORTUNITIES. \n\nOn the other hand, in the industries where these foreign STEM kids tend to find jobs, such as Information Technology, Finance, and Research Institutes. All the Americans who are CAPABLE of doing the same job can find full-time jobs much easier than these foreign kids. (You don't want to hire international students for the uncertainty related to the visa issue if you were an employer, as long as there was an American kid who was able to do the same thing.) However, companies still hire international kids just because of AMERICAN WORKERS ARE INCAPABLE OF DOING THE HIGH-TECH jobs. THESE FOREIGN TALENTS ARE NOT COMPETITORS OF AMERICAN WORKERS!

I have to say this extension is the smartest choice to make US get better. As all we know one of the key point why US get successful from the beginning of this century is that it provide equal rights to people with different background, different color and different language. We can find out that the success of US is really similar to the success of Roman Empire. The trigger to make both of them become one of the strongest country during their period is tightly related to the provide the same rights to everyone. Yes, the US citizens need to find good jobs, but they need to find the job they are really like and good at. Life is not that simple, if we really put them into the position related to STEM. What will happen? They may become feel tired about the things they did everyday and when they get tired their family will get unstable and then the whole nation will get unstable. Actually, most of my undergraduate school's US friend do tried to build their interests on the STEM fields at the beginning of them college life. But after one or two semester's study, they do find out what they are really interested in. Some of my friend find they are really interested in musical, painting and history.Then they do switch their study fields on these. After graduation, they all find jobs. To put in another way, if they really tried their best to get deep inside of the engineering fields, I don't think they will be happy as what they are right now. On the other hand, from the education of most international student, we are much good at the STEM fields. This is the best place to let us make some contribution to the US. The extension of OPT can be one of the best way to let more talent student get their chance to work in US, make the company they work at get strong. When the company get strong, the nation will get more tax from them. When the US get more tax, it will create more working positions which are suitable for these group of US citizens who really want to chase their dream. When their dream come true, the nation will become more close to paradise. So why we need to cut the OPT off and let all of these stop?

Some may argue OPT students receive lower payment and would affect domestic student's competition ability. However, we would have to ask who was the one gets discriminated if it was true, and obviously it should be who got less paid. And the fact is there is no such phenomena because of e-verify program. The difference of payment mostly comes between internship and official job, not because of the visa.\n\n3.

Many argues this could hurt minimum wages or take over US citizens job opportunities. However, that is not true. OPT STEM applicants need to be hired by E-Verified employer. The E-Verified programs gist is to not discriminate any employee, it protects both US citizens and other legal workers. Any violation would put the employer on the E-Verified program blacklist. Moreover, even if the OPT employees wage is lower, its not because of his or her status, its because this program originally is designed for internship, and interns could be reasonably paid less than full-time employer. Thus, the argument is false.\n\n2. The OPT STEM program is necessary when facing international students. US is famous of its education system and leading position in many industry areas. And in many years it successfully attracts many elites to come to the US. However, the visa could be a huge problem for international students, and be a crucial factor of decision. Many other countries now are following the US and even offering better visa programs for international students, including Canadas Post-Graduate Work Permit and Australias Post-Study Work Program. US is losing to many other competitor countries on visa programs. If this could not be changed, it would eventually hurt USs leading position in many areas.\n\n3. The new rule could even matter to the USs reputation. Many international students including me consider the US as the first choice due the OPT and OPT STEM program. Since I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering, it requires tons of professional training and years of experience to fulfill the high requirements in the job markets. Taking this program could help me be in the advantage place in my own country. Furthermore, Im now already on OPT STEM program. If this program be cancelled, it not only is going to hurt thousands of current employees like me and their employers, but also lead to questioning the US governments credibility, not even mention the legal risk.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Liang Yuan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12640", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I feel that OPT should be extended to 36 months as this will contribute to the increase in the revenue of the US government through State and Federal taxes.

As far as I know, at least, for Chinese students, lots of them go back to China after graduation. Some of them cannot find a jobs here. Some of them think they will be better off in China. For some find a job here, they might go back to China in the end. And finally for those who REALLY REALLY into American life, they STAY and \"take\" away you jobs.

Because you guys are the slackers, while the U.S need the most intelligent ones to push forward, to keep the first in the game. I see the effort have put to push U.S kids into STEM education. But it just doesn't meet the need for now. Again, U.S is a fair capitalist system. There is high demand for STEM graduates, and the U.S COULD NOT meet the need without the help of foreigners.

I believe this is one important factor that makes America great. I know many Americans are sick of the issue of illegal immigrants and it is easy to extend the resentment to legal immigrants. But legal immigrants have made significant contributions to this country. For example, most silicon valley companies are started by legal immigrants.\n\nIf an international student come to this country legally, finish his or her college degree and is wanted by a company while this company cannot hire an American to do the job, why not let him or her stay and contribute to the economics? Companies still paying high wages to such persons indicates that these international students did not steal the jobs from Americans by lowering the wages. If you look at the STEM majors at universities, foreigners are the majority there and to be frank, most of them do perform excellently in their study.\n\nGranting illegal immigrants amnesty and sending away outstanding legal immigrants would be a huge mistake by the US government and would weaken the US substantially. I believe this OPT extension is a good thing for the US economics and the American people. The highly-skilled foreign students can produce more job opportunities in the US and that is actually what's happening right now.\n\nThis OPT extension can help the US attract and keep more and more skilled immigrants whom are needed by this country.

The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers.

A good amount of them get scholarship or stipend for their study, especially for the students in the top universities. Cutting the time international students can legally work in the US means that the US is encouraging them to go back to contribute to their home countries after this great amount of investment upfront from the US government/ organizations. This does not seem like a smart deal for the US. Second, keeping more international students in companies and teams can greatly increase working diversity. Since the US economic is getting more and more global, adding more international perspectives can only do good than harm. Third, the extension of OPT does not post any threats to the US economy. Now the unemployment rate in the US already drops below 5% and it is projected to become even stronger in the near future. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned with threats to the US employment market as some people propose. Fourth, when post-graduation employment odds is not as welcoming as before, a lot of international students may decide to go to other countries instead of US. This will greatly cut a lot of revenue that educational institutions currently collect from international students.

If there is such a need for STEM trained employees in American, why have billing rates gone from over $150 per hour in the 1990s to under $50 per hour now for an expert?  On top of this, clients stopped paying for travel during this time period as well.\n\nMost companies now have an \"India first\" policy when staffing for projects or positions.  This means that all positions and projects are funded low in the expectation of staffing with H1b candidates or candidates on this program.  These companies all have H1b dependent vendors.  They try to source all staffing through these firms in order to get low rates.  This means that no Americans get these jobs due to these H1b dependent firms' racist preference for Indian employees.  I have never once seen an Indian employ an African American.  This program is essentially an unlimited source of additional candidates for these H1b dependent firms.\n\nI am an American Citizen.  I have worked hard the last 20 years to build my career and my company.  Please don't take that away from me.  Please provide Relief for Americans - end this program now.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dana Showers", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2487", "postedDate": "2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It would be great if opt is extended.....great advantage for students", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lakshmidhar reddy Avuthu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19806", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I Strongly support OPT extension with 24 months for STEM international students. \n\nFirst, OPT extension policies ensure U.S schools become especially competitive versus other countries(e.g. UK, Canada, Australia), by OPT's allowing international students to apply what they learn to business practice, to gain solid skills and experience before they returning to home countries.\n\nSecond, attracted by OPT extension policies, hundreds of thousands international students come to U.S to receive education, contributing to U.S schools, educations and research by paying billions of tuition, and to U.S domestic consumption and economic growth by spending billions on living expenses.\n\nThird, attracted by OPT extension policies, the most talented students from all over the world will prefer come to U.S to contribute to this country's research and development on science and technology sector, which basically has contributed and will contribute to U.S long term competitiveness globally.

Also, the OPT extension could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree\n\n* The OPT program is corporate welfare.

Many older STEM workers that get caught in this cannot seem to get their foot back in the door - employers don't want to hire them because they don't have to! Dont' believe me?

If they could not get a H1B visa, then they have to leave US and move to another country.

Please note that I'm speaking based on my experiences as a recent Statistics graduate (M.A.).\n\nFirst of all, the OPT does not take jobs from qualified Americans. There are many, many reasons for this,and it's difficult to describe them all. \n\n* Companies have a very strong preference for domestic talent, due to language issues, visa issues, and cultural mismatches; thus an equally skilled American worker will ALWAYS win over a foreign worker (in fact, even a significantly less skilled American can often get the job). \n\n* There aren't enough Americans in post-graduate education, and the ones that are are simply not as talented as foreign students. There is a flagging domestic interest in STEM postgraduate degrees -- in 2015, less than 50% of postgraduate STEM degrees went to American citizens, according to the Pew Research Center. For many schools, the actual percentage is much, much higher. In my department, 80% to 90% of students were foreign. If you think the solution is for schools to hire more domestic talent, then know that in my cohort, my school had 20 domestic applicants and 220 foreign applicants. It's much harder to get accepted as a foreign student and thus the foreign students who do get accepted are better. Thus, it's clear that Americans (at least in my field) simply aren't chasing the post-graduate education that many employers need. Foreign students are fulfilling a need for skilled workers that Americans cannot supply by themselves. \n\n* The opt only lasts 12 months, and the proposed rule allows for a 17 month extension for STEM graduates only. This is less than three years, not a long time from the perspective of companies. In order to retain workers hired via OPT, they need an H1-B visa, which is expensive and limited, and requires that no qualified Americans apply for the position. For this reason, many companies don't seriously consider OPT candidates that will eventually require a visa sponsorship, unless they have no other choice.\n\nA close look at the job search shows how much companies favor Americans. After graduating, I applied to about 30 jobs before I got an offer. Based on communications with foreign students, I would estimate that, on average, they submit about 200-500 applications before getting a job, and 1000+ is not uncommon. These are graduates who are as talented, if not more so, than myself.\n\nSo foreigners are not taking our jobs. Why do we need this rule? The reason is we need this talent. We trained them in America, and they are reaching the highest level of education that we offer. America has spent a lot of time and money developing their talents. Most importantly, they overwhelmingly WANT to be here. They wish to work in America and contribute their considerable skills to the American economy. A great many of them wish to immigrate. This rule really does help America's best and brightest, our smartest and most talented workers who will contribute to the US economy. Why, oh why would we kick them out 12 months after we give them a degree?!\n\nPLEASE allow this rule to take effect. This rule is a major step forward to improving immigration and improving the US economy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gregory Chandler", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15003", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I fully support the proposed rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Viswa Murali", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2502", "postedDate": "2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal because I've seen many talented international coworkers, they are making huge contribution to our country.

I will outline the benefits of this program to US employers, US economy, US universities, and the international students which are the crme de la crme in their respective fields.\n\n\nWhy we need OPT Extension?\n\n1) Allows students to obtain work visa\nOPT extension covers a gap in US visa laws. Unlike other countries such as Canada, Australia etc, in US having a job does not equate to being eligible to apply for a work visa. For example in Canada, students after graduation find a job and if they get one are automatically given a work permit. The same holds true for many other counties in the world. \n\n2) Importance to US Universities\nWithout OPT extension, US would see a sharp decline in international students coming to the US. With no clear path to stay in the US students would seek opportunities in other countries which are open about work-visa. International students currently make up 50 to 70% of enrollment in graduate programs alone according to National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), international students play a critical role in sustaining quality science, technology, and engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduate programs at U.S. universities [1].\n\nIt is therefore in the best interest of the US Economy to retain these students as many of the US universities are partly funded by the tuition fees these international students bring. If immigration were a deterrent several programs would collapse.\n \nI further quote Stuart Anderson, NFAPs executive director International students help many universities have enough graduate students to support research programs that help attract top faculty and that also thereby help U.S. students by having a higher-quality program than they otherwise would have, youd see a shrinking across the board where youd have just certain schools that are able to support good programs. That would lead to a shrinking of U.S. leadership in education and technology if you have many fewer programs with high-quality research and top-level professors.\n \n3) Importance to US Economy and US Employers\nThe US Economy needs international students to retain its place as the global head of innovation. It should be a clear that if US employers have enough jobs for these students, it is up to the US government to find a way to amend the immigration system to allow the companies to retain this talent.\nFurthermore, these students are important anchors in building global connections between their hometowns abroad and their U.S. metropolitan destinations. Researchers have found links in between entrepreneurial activities of U.S. educated foreigners in Silicon Valley with their home regions. Immigrant entrepreneur networks play a critical role in technology industries international expansion, linking Silicon Valley to new technology hubs in Bangalore (India), Hsinchu Technology Park (Taiwan) and Shanghai (China) [2].\n\n4) Overcomes comes limitations of current H1B Process\nOPT Extension gives multiple chances to those who wish to remain in US, to obtain H1B through a lottery system. But putting all talent in a randomizer is no way of assuring US retains the best [3]. Approximately 250,000 applications were received by USCIS for H1B in April 2015, without OPT Extension one is relying on pure luck with only one chance to earn an H1B or exit even if they are more capable than those who managed to pull through the draw.\n \nH1B Visas are first come first serve or lottery based if more than 80,000 people from anywhere in the world apply and does not allocate visas based on industry demand or sector. It offers little or no benefit to those who have studied in the US versus outside which is not the case in several other counties. Anyone with a bachelors degree in India or China and from a non-US university can apply and get H1B work Visa even outside the US. \n\nThe problem here is that in many cases IT companies such as Infosys, TCS, Accenture, Cognizant, Oracle etc. apply in huge numbers for H1B just to show to their potential clients in the US that they have a resource ready to be sent to off-shore locations in the US. Many of these people who get H1B dont even come to the US, while successfully displacing international students in the US who wish to remain and work in the US. This however is topic for another debate. \n\nOf course in the absence of this rule, not much will change for the approximately 50,000 workers [4] being forced to leave the country in Feb 2016. The best talent will find competitive positions in other countries or even their home counties. However the OPT extension will benefit the US immensely and help realize the dreams of those who have invested the best part of their lives in the US to further their careers and contribute to the US economy.\n\n\nBackground and Cited Reference List in Attached File ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sahil Popli", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4676", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I would like to thank DHS for proposing the new rule to support STEM program.

Generally, I am never wanting for stimuli that foster a visceral disgust at the everyday sellout of U.S. citizens in employment context; there is a rotten cornucopia of anecdotes involving U.S. citizens being cut loose so that foreign workers can take their place. On occasion, U.S. citizens have had to endure the humiliation of training their foreign replacements. \n\nThe laws and regulations concerning the conduct of business and commerce in the United States ought to form a framework that unequivocally makes the training and hiring of non-citizens a measure of last resort. \n\nLet me repeat that thought in a different context for emphasis. \n\nAs of October 28, 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau's \"Population Clock\" (http://www.census.gov/popclock/) reports there are roughly 322,049,XXX million persons residing in the United States. The \"USA QuickFacts\" from the Census Bureau (http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html) reports that in 2014, 23.1% of people in the U.S. were under age 18, with 14.5% over age 65. Businesses in the United States should be compelled by law to hire from that vast pool (over 18 and under 65) a U.S. citizen. There should be provision in the law for the hiring of non-citizens, but *only* as a measure of last resort. Common sense compels the conclusion that to do anything less is to give U.S. citizens seeking employment the proverbial \"shaft.\"\n\nI am doubtful that there are not enough U.S. citizens with STEM degrees, either unemployed or seeking employment in STEM fields, to fill the vacancies that these businesses purport are best filled by foreigners. To a greater degree, I am certain that the businesses which complain of an ache that can only be soothed by foreign labor are motivated by the desire to pay lower wages and lower employment taxes.\n\nMake the right decision, and be lauded for sticking up for U.S. citizens with STEM degrees that are unemployed or seeking employment in a STEM field.\n\nMake the wrong decision, and this U.S. citizen will make yet another entry in the list of \"Instances of the Government Favoring the Interests of Foreigners over the Interests of Citizens.\"\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dale Race", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2791", "postedDate": "2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As an international student, I DO AGREE the statement of OPT Extension. \nAs a F-1 student, we appreciate the opportunity to study abroad in US. However, we think we are able to do more than simply taking your resources but contributing nothing.\nAs an undergraduate or graduate student, we averagely spent four years studying in US. In these years, we studied in the same libraries and classrooms as you Americans did, took the same resources as you American took, and enjoyed the same public facilitates that open to students as you American enjoyed. That is, WE, INTERNATIONAL STUDENT, have already taken all of the resources that you provided in universities and colleges. We have already in a great percentage compared to you native people with advanced education. \nIndeed, based on many kinds of reasons, many universities are expanding their admissions year-by year. For example, as myself, I come from a Top10 school based on the ranking of US News while this is currently my fourth year. As I experienced, more than 300-500 international students out of totally 5000 are joining in our schools EACH year compare to the previous one.\nTherefore, is it fair that we SIMPLY take your resources for knowledge and research BUT do not contribute ourself according to what we get from you?! Admittedly, some PHD students can contribute themselves from some researches. HOWEVER, will this profit your country so much? No! This is mostly profit PHDs themselves in their future career.\nThen, the BEST and the ONLY way for us to make contribution to your country is to working here and make REAL PROFIT to your economy! How much time is it enough for such contribution? 12 months sounds okay, 17 months sounds good, 24 months sounds great BUT still not the best. \nACTUALLY, IS IT FAIR AND WORTHY TO YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE, THAT WE TAKE FOUR YEARS OF YOUR RESOURCES, BUT CONTRIBUTE ONLY ONE YEAR TO YOUR PEOPLE AND COUNTRY?!\nThe more contribution we make to you, the more profit your country will get, and the better life quality your government can provide.\nAs we F-1 student here, as we make contributions, we can not only make you profit via the companies incomes but also the tax we paid. All of these money can \n(1) help you provide better life quality to your native American people, \n(2) give you money to open more companies that offering jobs to your native American people.\nIn conclusion, this statement of OPT Extension is really important based on what I illustrated.

A lot of citizens complaint that the new OPT policy will reduce the opportunities for the American people to find jobs. However, I don't find any relationship between them.

Its result in the lower opportunities of employment for American people if most of the employment positions are filled in the traditional industries ( food, travel and traffic ).

The approval of this proposal will obviously increase the national strength of US and benefit general people who lives in this country as well.\n\nFirst of all, modern society is kind of driven by high-technology and new technology, we have already seen dramatic changes in our lives brought by high-tech idea and products. And all those positive changes couldn't even happen without the support of all the people who devoted themselves to the high-tech career, STEM one of them. And the amount of these people needed are way beyond the amount of the domestic student who are major in this specific area. So there are thousands of foreign students came to American universities to study and to apply what they learned in the industries after graduation. These students are all young, creative, talented and knowledgeable. These talents are welcomed all over the world. The reason that these people come to American is not only because American schools provide the best education in the world, is also because US provides better training opportunities for them. And in return they contribute what they learned to the industries and at the same time make US a better country. On the other hand, to many companies in the US, current foreign STEM talents are dispensable, and once the proposal is denied, all the STEM people who will be influenced will search for alternative career opportunities in other parts of the world, which will be a disaster for many companies. And for those who participate in large research/software development projects, which would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, those foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nSecondly, as I mentioned earlier, these students are young talents who can contribute a lot either to academic fields or to industry world. On the one hand, they provide strong competitiveness to their companies. On the other hand, let's take the people who have H1B for example, The average salary from H1B last year is about 100,000 each year. They pay average about 15 percent of their income to US as tax.We all know US is in big amount of debt for this social welfare which gives its economy a trouble. If we keep those young people in our country and let them keep paying taxes. It will release the financial burden of US significantly. With the taxes paid by opt users, we can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research. And the these people wouldn't occupy much resources at all while they are producing more than the average produce of American citizens. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yu Deng, Indiana University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12539", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "NO ON OPT PROGRAM.

I also believe that students currently on STEM Extensions should not be impacted if the rule does not go in place by February 12, 2016. This will cause unnecessary gaps in employment and will prove to be unnecessarily complicated for USCIS to rescind approved work authorizations. \n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2013 with a master's degree in the field of Digital Media from New York University. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \n\nIn April 2008, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued an interim final rule with request for comments that extended the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrants with a qualifying STEM degree. On August 12, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the 17-month STEM extension created by the 2008 Rule, but ordered that the vacatur be stayed until February 12, 2016. If DHS does not issue a final rule to replace the 2008 Rule, thousands of foreign students with work authorizations, such as myself, will be forced to scramble to depart the United States. This will impose a costly burden on the U.S. tech sector if thousands of young workers have to leave their jobs on February 12, 2016. \n\nForeign students represent half of all U.S. graduate enrollments in engineering, math, and computer science. There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Master's degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit. \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers. \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by extending the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees through a new rule submitted for proper notice and comment by February 12, 2016. \n\n\nThank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSaranya Kapur", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Saranya Kapur", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0705", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The new proposed 24 months STEM OPT extension length is appropriate and will be extremely beneficial to U.S. universities, U.S. advanced research project agencies, and for promoting efficiency in U.S. education.\n\nAs a professional research associate at a university, my experience showed that the average length of a research project in Electrical Engineering is around 3 years. While the average program length for Ph.D. students is 5 years. Therefore, it is very common for students to be involved in two or more research projects, and to graduate with their research project unfinished. Some graduated students choose to stay with the university for a bit longer to either help new students get involved or finish report writing. This promotes smooth transitions in these research projects. \n\nHowever, after graduation, foreign students without OPT cannot be employed as research assistants nor continue working on their original research project. Most foreign students choose to leave the university and look for industrial work experience very early because of the pressure from limited OPT time. As a result, the research projects have to go through the hardship of finding support and guidance for new students and fall behind due to these issues.\n\n\nWith the new 24 month OPT extension, foreign students will be both able and more willing to help wrap up their research projects after graduation.

The government should let the students who gained knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. Many of them are actually really excellent students and are well encouraged by the spirit of U.S.. And they are very willing to make contributions to a wide range of areas, especially in science and engineering. \n\n2. Diversity is an very important factor for the U.S. . People are working with outstanding people from all over the world, and learning from each other's different cultures and concepts. The world in the future will be a global village where people should learn and get used to working or living with people from other countries. Thus this proposal is a very good preparation for it.     \n\n3. Moreover, as a well-known immigrant nation, the United Stats can not be the most powerful and democratic country in the world without those outstanding people from all over the world. In the United States National Academy of Sciences, many academician were actually just excellent international students years ago. And now the rapidly developing science and technology in US are promoted by those people.\n  \n4. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can make the industry to choose those actual prominent people in that area. And the average professional level will be raised when more excellent people are standing out. Thus an industry area, or even the whole society can not get advancement without benign competition. \n\n5. For some areas, international students are not  taking the jobs and positions away from domestic people just because lower salary. On the contrary, these areas are having a large  demand for talents and can not get enough human resource just from domestic people.  \n\nBased on all the reasons listed above, I firmly support this proposal and be sure that the whole country will gain large benefit from it.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Du Tang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14276", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As an international student, I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, as we all know, the United States is a developed country which has the most advanced technology, which is the reason why the United States attracts so many international students every year. We appreciate the knowledge we acquired here and would like to do something return to this country. This is the main reason we need OPT extension.\n\nSecond, from my own observation, international students accounts for a primary part in the field of technology, say, computer science. As for me, I am also a graduate student work in this area. If international students cannot get the OPT extension, internet companies will lose a huge part of excellent employees, which will definitely obstacle the development of these companies and then may influence US economy significantly.\n\nThird, each position has specific requirements and employees must match these requirements. If a position has much more foreigners than US citizens, this means that the company cannot find enough qualified US citizens for the position since most companies prefer US citizens comparing with foreigns for the lower cost in recruiting and fewer troubles in the future considering identification. Therefore international students will not bring too many competitions to US citizens but fill in the shortage of qualified employees in certain area.\n\nTherefore, I do hope this proposal could be approved.

A lot of the mentors in my career have suggested keeping the first job for at least 2-3 years to truly learn something from it. With extended F1 OPT visa, some of us don't need to go through the hassle of applying for H1B (which becomes more and more competitive these days). Instead, we could get enough training and then return to our home country. With limited time of F-1 OPT, some of us are forced to apply for H1B, and forced to stay here longer given the difficulty of obtaining a H1B visa again. \n\nCurrently, I work in a research and development department in a structural engineering company. This is also the most diverse group within the company. We have several PHDs, and some really talented engineers from all over the world. This atmosphere and cultural diversity not only bring different ideas to the group, but also encourage different approaches for problem solving and outlook for the industry. \n\nAlso, this group brought a connection with India. Our company just opened an Indian office several years ago and it brought so much more income and profits to our company, which benefits all employees.\n\nMaybe local people tend to regard international students as invaders, but we are not. Several researches have shown that immigrants, (especially those with advanced degrees) don't steal jobs from local people, instead, they create more incomes and revenues, which boosts the economy. It is very hard for local people to possess the same point of view as us, because we have been local for our own country, and new comers for USA.

Many of my fellow contractors/co-workers are STEM students either still on OPT or just awarded an H1B visa. The engineers and scientist I've worked with have benefited tremendously from engaging with international citizens in ways that most Americans do not. It is a well known fact that most Americans don't travel outside the US and most have little to no understanding of cultural differences. In my experience these issues were organically addressed in the workplace, which was about 50% international. My American cohorts got to learn more about other places and cultures and got to teach us more about America as well. An additional advantage of allowing international students to partake in the American job market is that it also makes it more competitive and encourages US citizens to obtain higher degrees and additional job related training. This in turn makes the workers more productive and effective and increases the overall economic productivity. Another factor to consider is that although some people claim they can't find jobs because STEM students have saturated the market - this is not the whole truth. But even if it were partially true, the fact of the matter is that these workers are needed in the US. There are a more American students studying liberal arts instead of sciences, which leaves the market lacking skilled workers young workers, thus forcing mature workers to work even longer. \n\nI think that even with the STEM extension, internationals are only here temporarily. There's a cap on the H1B visa and the extension only affords STEM students multiple opportunities to apply but guarantees nothing. STEM students won't saturate the market if the extension is allowed. I see the STEM extension as a win-win situation because ultimately there's a great brain exchange occurring. Inexperienced but highly educated international students acquire skills in the American job market. Some of them may get visas and stay while others have to return to their home countries or find opportunities elsewhere. Those that stay, continue to help the US economy and those that leave help their own countries and inadvertently maintain a healthy free market competition with the US and other western economies.

The OPT extension was originally designed for students who received higher education in specific fields of science and technology to practice what they learned in various high tech industries which nowhere else in the world has a more advanced entire eco-system than the United States. The competitive advantage of this country has been and will always be built on technological innovations and progressions, depriving STEM students the opportunity to stay in the US for the long term and contribute to technological advancements is step back from making this country better and more competitive, and more importantly it sends an unwelcoming message to the international student community.\n\n2. STEM majored international students do not pose a threat to U.S. citizens who also seek employment in similar fields because for decades there has been a severe shortage of STEM majored master/PhD students in the U.S. OPT extension was first implemented to solve this exact problem. In addition, over the years the number US college students who choose to study in STEM majors has been decreasing, so why all of a sudden the government needs to cut back on the supply of STEM majored students to the labor force. This simply makes no logical sense.\n\n3. STEM majored students is only a PART of H1B applicants every year. They should not be singled out and targeted for a broader issue. STEM students contribute to the U.S higher education industry and they put in really hard work to seek opportunities to contribute to the greater society, they should be placed on a level playing field with all other qualified candidates.

Contrary to what some may believe, the fact that foreign graduate students try to take highly skilled jobs to work in this country makes it increasingly competitive. The work they have done in places like silicon valley has benefited this country as a whole as well as its people. \n\nNevertheless, it's been significantly more difficult for foreign STEM students to stay and work here now compared to 5 or 10 years ago because of the obsolete immigration regulations. The chance of scoring a H1B visa has reached the lowest in the history which drives foreign students out of the country. It just makes no sense for the US to educate students with its best colleges for other countries and then force them to go home, especially when many of them receive scholarships and free tuition for their graduate level studies. \n\nSTEM students take jobs that require special training and skills in science and technology. In fact, when both foreign and american STEM students with similar background aim for the same job, companies rarely pick foreign students and everyone knows recruiting them and going through the process for their visas is a pain.\n\nExtending and improving the OPT program can potentially give more foreign students more opportunities to work here and stop the immigrant exodus.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sean W", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13335", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I would say that I strongly agree with the new rules assigned by DHS this time. The reasons are quite obvious and straight forward. Before I list my reasons to support the new Regulations, I would like to simplify this regulation's goal in one sentence. The purpose of this regulations is to support the international students graduated in US to work legally with longer time. \n\nHere I would argue for the support with following reasons based on the points view from the government, employers and the students themselves. \n\nFor governments, the benefits are HUGE. First, they will receive more tax and fees from the employers with longer time. Also, the longer time the students stay, the more steady tax they will get. Second, the students would drive the economy locally in various ways in this case. Once the student get a good pay job, they will spend on the foods, living purchases, renting or buying the houses, cars, and even traveling. Thus, not only the local governments, but also the other local companies will be benefited from the international workers with long time permit to work. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the President also know that clear: the economy in the US is the best ever since the financial crisis in 2008. They know that for sure the more international workers staying in US, the stronger US's economy is. When we look back in the history, the international workers always dedicate a lot to the economy since the United States is built. And it is also known that the US is a country build up on immigrants from the very beginning in 1776.\n\nFrom the employers' points of view, the benefits are straight absolutely. As far as I know, the STEM related jobs are most fitted with international students' major in US, for example, computer science, math, financial engineering, mechanical engineering, robotics engineering, chemical engineering, electronic engineering and etc. These engineering and scientific workers contribute a lot to the societies' economy and the boost the companies and especially startup companies to develop.  When people are using Google, Facebook, iphone, ipad, Amazon, they should know that there are hundreds of thousands of international workers developing and maintaining those companies and inventing new things to facilitate the life for american people. The new CEO of Microsoft and Google are Indians, they are the great examples among those foreign worker in the US that contribute to the country and society.\n\nAs an international student, I have to say that the each person's career path and also their knowledge as well as the view of the world would be refreshed after their longer time of working experience in the US. They would more likely to accept and broadcast the values of the US. The more people favor of the US ways of doing things, the less enemies there exist in the future. In addition, most of the international workers like to work in the US since there are great work environments and the great colleagues to work with, also they are better paid and better lived in the US.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Junwei Guan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13301", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is my second submission. Read a couple of comments, feeling it's necessary to clarify a few points.\n\nOne point made by Charles Hofacker is as following:\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nI am really doubtful of this data. So please give the EXACT reference for these data. I couldn't find 2009-2013 job opennings, but I found there are 5.4 million job opennings this August 2015(http://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm). 430000 out of 5400000 is 7.96%, which means there is less than 1 OPT worker out of 10 job opennings. Needless to say 430000 is the accumulative number from 2009 to 2013. How can you make the conclusion that OPT workers are aggressively stealing jobs from American workers. Seriously? If you know the math, you know the answer.\n\n$4 billion from SS and Medicare, woo, that's tons of money for sure. But again, please list data resources. Most non-citizens students do not have any assistantship or scholarship. In another word, they need to pay tuition, to be more specific, out of state tuition, which is way more than in-state tuition which most citizens pay. With the tuition paid by non-citizen, schools can make tuition much lower for US citizen and also allow school to get more funding. Right now,  I am working on OPT and I pay social security and medicare tax every month.\n\n\nPoint made by Steven Thompson is as following:\nWE have enough STEM workers in the USA.\n\nWhere is your support reference? How do you make such a conclusion. I don't have exact data for Stem works number. But when I was at school(LSU), there were only a few US citizens compared to the number of non-citizen in stem majors(like mathematics, statistics, computer science etc.), although citizens have have much lower bar to get into these stem programs. Why? Because citizens don't like stem majors, they don't want to play around with these hard and time consuming majors. Instead, they prefer non-stem majors(like MBA, finance, economics etc), which is relatively simpler and could also make them much richer in the future. As US becomes the leading power in technology, especially IT, there are lots of new opennings in these area every day. For example, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, even hot start-ups, like Airbnb, Uber, all these companies needs huge amount of stem workers. I am sure that all US citizen stem workers can not fill the gap.\n\nPoint made by James Mangan is:\nThis is just another method of GOVT pandering to big business to drive down wages. STEM college students shouldnt have to compete with foreign students who will accept lower wages just to stay here. \n\nI don't know where this low wages coming from. I am working on Amazon, and my salary package is way above average(Note I also pay social security and medicare a lot every month). All of my friends including both citizen and non-citizen, they all make decent amount of money. However, there are cases that several consulting or outsourcing companies offer opennings in US to foreigners at a super low wages(Note these foreigners do not have education in US and therefore, they don't have OPT at all). For example, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro. If you look at how much H1b applications they file each year, you will be SHOCKED! Here is the H1b application and average salaries for the companies: http://www.myvisajobs.com/Reports/2015-H1B-Visa-Sponsor.aspx. I do think these outsourcing companies are hurting US citizens, NOT OPT students who get excellent education in US.\n\nThanks,\nAlex", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yu Ge", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13933", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The proposal to re-institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry.

Giving them a better opportunity to find a job will help the technology of high performance computer spreads to other fields of industry with a speed two times higher than the scenario that many of them lost a better opportunity to work in a relative field in US. Furthermore, with the more widely use of high performance chips, the manufacturing industry will benefit a lot from it. That's the reason why this policy will bring wealth to the nation.\n\nSecondly, international students play an important role in many fields within STEM.

The US education system can benefit a lot from the opt-extension rule. The most important reason why so many international students come to US for education is the opportunity to work here and apply the knowledge they have learnt after graduation. And they have paid a large amount of tuition to thousands of colleges in US. Now days, many other countries such as Canada, England, Australia, they all offer work opportunities to international students. If the opt-extension rule was disapproved, it will make the education in US very much less attractive, which will damage the education system not only in a short term, but also in a long term.\n\n2.It will be a disaster for the economy if the opt-extension rule is disapproved. Most foreign STEM talents choose to stay and work in US only because of the OPT extension rule and they have made huge contributions to US economy. Without the OPT extension rule, so many STEM talents will choose to leave US and work in other countries, and the detrimental effect on US economy is obvious and clear. And those US-high tech companies (Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook etc) also won't agree with the termination of opt extension rule because they are all supported by thousands of international STEM talents.\n\n3.OPT extension rule can guarantee the continuity of projects. For example, I work in a automobile component company and most of the projects we are doing will last at least two years, and the opt extension rule can give enough time to international STEM employees to apply their skills and finish the projects, which will definitely benefit the company and the economy.\n\nThere are a lot of other reasons why I support the OPT extension rule and I cannot list them all.

I would like to summarize my arguments in the following points:\n1.\tFrom an economic perspective, allowing STEM students to continue to work in US for an extended period will undoubtedly continue to push the new technological development, which creates more and more jobs for the growth of US economy. Take the new IT companies such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft for instance, F-1 STEM students from all over the world to do innovative work so that these companies are generating lots of profits that benefit common US investors, where consequently drive the economy through consumptions, transportation, and entertainment. If such period is restricted to 1 year, the US economy will observe a large outflow of young talents as they will no longer be able to obtain their H-1B by the lottery process. Without such strong support for the technological development, the economy will undoubtedly be negatively impacted and the job creations result from the new technological development will decrease.\n2.\tFrom a freedom perspective, it is the import of brain powers from all over the world that makes US a great nation. Since the US was established about 400 years ago, because of its respect of freedom, people with all kinds of backgrounds, cultures and religions are living in this gods chosen world. Creative thoughts are being generated, and lots of first times of brilliant events occurred in this place, such as Transistors, Computers, Airplanes, Space Discovery, and so on. A great component of these innovative work can be traced back by talents born in foreign countries. Take the past 10 years of Nobel Prizes for example, 61 scholars in US were awarded this prize during 2006-2015 (from Wikipedia), among them, 20 were born from foreign countries. Given that the H-1B is currently in lottery process, adding 1-year constraint to the STEM F-1 students will force these young talents to leave US and threaten new foreign students to study here as they will experience the hardship again when they graduate. Such a constraint is clearly not supporting the freedom of people who make contributions to US economy.\nI hope my comments are helpful and worth my time in writing them.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mao Ye", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20650", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this proposal. \n\nFirstly, to boost the economic and scientific development, the U.S needs more high-educated and qualified scholars especially in STEM areas. \n\nAlthough it is true it would be easier for Americans finding a job, if intern students were sent back after graduating. However, the decreasing competition would result in worse employee resources.

Just because if you have both of the working and studying experience abroad rather than just studying, it would be more easier to find a job when they go back to homeland.

As far as I know, there are a lot of programs (mostly belong to STEM program) encouraging their students to get more engaged in the real-industrial and learn how to apply their knowledge in the real world. OPT extension will definitely give students more opportunities to gain real-industrial experience. In turn, it can also help enhance the quality of US college education. \n\nBesides, a high quality education system will certainly attract more students all over the world to come US pursing knowledge. We are all saying that diversity and equality are the most significant elements in American spirit. The pass of this new rule will definitely persist those spirits.\n\nIn addition, I believe OPT extension will reduce the stress and cost for both companies and society. If there is only one-year OPT, after 1 year, the company need to look for another candidate to do the same job. Hiring and training new people will take companies a lot of time and money cost.

Thirdly, cancelling OPT extension would only bring drawbacks to US economy in the long term, the logic chain is very obvious - less foreigners would be willing to study in the US - less available talents for academic and commercial worlds (international academic collaboration, international companies) - less promising profits/achievements realized in the future - US becomes less competitive in this globalization era.

I'm an international graduate student from China and will be working in the U.S. soon. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.\n\nSTEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. As a master student, I have had offers from U.S., UK and Germany when applying for graduate school. I came to U.S. because I believe it will better prepare me for a professional career in the OPT and the extension period. Though tuition in U.S., especially in private school, is  huge amount of money, I still feel it worthwhile if I am able to develop professional skills, and also to have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry because I will have excellent resume to bring back to China. One year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.\n\n12-months seems not enough for foreign students to gain enough work experience. For example, some school doesnt have CPT. And if students want to have an internship to get to know more about the industry, they would have used 3 month on internship. And after that, if they feel really interested in working in the  industry in U.S. they would like to seek a full time position. Some companies spend a few month training fresh graduates, so it will only be a few months left for foreign students to contribute professional skills to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company. \n\nIn addition, I believe U.S. employers will benefit from the knowledge, not only professional skills, but also customs and languages of  their own countries from STEM OPT students, and this will give the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast.

It extends STEM students work and practice time, with no proving competition effect for US citizens. With a 24 month extension, after a long term training in school, STEM graduates can have longer time to practically contribute to their specific industry, creating much more values to US society. Compared with returning to their own countries with the knowledge they mastered here in US, the US would benefit much more if these graduates stay here contributing for 2 more years. They will boost the tech development, and they will also boost the consumption and economy. The OPT extension only allows the graduates do certain very specific work in their fields, and usually, they're in high end cutting edge topics, which can hardly be competed with most other US citizens, and without these OPT students, many projects will not be finished at all,  \n2. Whoever that says \"foreigners get out of the country\", are the ones either being competed away, or the ones holding discrimination, and the point is that they over-exaggerated the case of the OPT extension to be equal to a surely increase of immigrants, which is absolutely wrong generalization and quite emotional with no logics. For foreigners who have the tendency to immigrate, they prepare for it in many ways regardless with the OPT extension. No proving evidence so far could support the assumption of OPT extension facilitates the immigration, instead, it only exists in some extremists' imagination. What they can see might only be a temporary increasing population, what they don't see is how US technology and economy rely on these OPT trainees' work and efforts. For a normal US citizen, it's forgivable to focus only on one single point in the trivial life, but for US government, it's your obligation to vision the case in a national scale of view, and realize that the OPT extension does nothing but contribute to US economy and technology, and without the OPT extension there will be a drop in both that are expected, and, the OPT extension has nothing to do with the immigration situation!\n3. A current situation for the foreign graduates: for the 80s generation coming from China, most of the students returned to China either right after the graduation or after the OPT ended. For my year, in my PhD program in my lab, we used to have ~10 Chinese students in the past, and 6 of them returned already, while 3 of them are waiting for the degree to be finished and have booked one-way tickets back to China right after graduation. You can see a trend of students gave up the US and return their own country with the most advanced technology already. If OPT extension is not a possible solution in the future to keep these students, I would envision a dramatic drop of the industrial achievements, and also there would be a dramatic drop of students applying for US universities as a whole in the future.\n4. Speaking about the graduate school application, people go to graduate school to prepare for their career. If they know it's harder for them to get a practice opportunity after graduation due to the short OPT time, they of course turn their eyes other ways. Nowadays the European graduate schools application is getting hotter and hotter, and you can how these foreign students went there and boosted the local economy, the tourism, the industry, the technology etc. Failure to extend the OPT will make the US university less and less appealing, and in this unstable economy situation worldwide, it does no good to prevent students coming in US to study. Therefore the OPT extension attracts the students to apply for US schools and eventually boost US economy.\nTherefore, I strongly support the OPT extension. And I sincerely hope current US citizens calm down and think about the current situation, and understand the benefits of this OPT extension, which does much more good to US development than to the student him/herself.

The disadvantage for banning OPT extension is obvious and there are potential severe outcomes. Following is just some simple fact that you might find helpful for your decision-making. The OPT program as a good training program aids vast attraction to international students for coming to US to accomplish their college study. According to the Department of Commerce 2014, the international students contribute 27 billion dollars to the US economy in a single year, which is equivalent to the market value of Yahoo! For a four-year period, this group of people contribute around 110 billion dollars to the economy, which is more than half market value of Warmart, twice of Target and thrice of Adobe. Just thinking about how many jobs can be added if we have another two companies like Target? You cannot simply ignore it. Furthermore, this number is increasing because of the OPT extension policy.

It is uncountable that the United States has the most innovative and advanced science level in the world. However, these scientific progresses cannot become something usable and helpful to everyone without the interpretation of scientists. When I was doing my internship in a pharmaceutical company this summer, I saw thousands of foreign employees like me who devoted that night and days by the benches and tested on all these new molecules and available drugs for rare diseases. As one of the many, I came to the United States to gain my knowledge and gradually started to dream about bringing better life quality and healthier life to everyone in the world. The science we have learnt and worked on for years would be meaningless if we couldn't turn it into real treatment to help the patients. The earth of equal and justice offer us with the opportunity to make our dream come true, as the pharmaceutical companies in the United States spend the most amount of money in drug and medical research compare to the rest of the world. We foreign employees have the opportunity here to turn the science into real medicine and medial technology. In fact, the United States also has the fastest pace in medicine and medical technology innovation. \nHowever, if we don't get the chance to work in the United States, we, as well-trained scientists, would have to go back to our own countries, which are mostly developing countries whose government or industries unfortunately don't have the power and insight to support the development of social welfare and medicine. The money and time that the entire higher education system of the American has spent on these foreign talented young scientists would turn into nothing. \nThe pharmaceutical industry in the United States will also collapse because it is currently largely depending on the well-trained and low-paid foreign scientists. As I mentioned in the previous text, the industry of pharmaceutics is greatly money consuming and labor intense. Most pharmaceutical companies cannot afford costly research and massive well-paid workers at the same time. Therefore great amount of medical researches and drug researches will be suspended. New medicines would be postponed forever because there won't be enough people to work in the health care industry and those nearsighted objectors will be complaining about not having the popper treatment or medicines for their health issues. \nAs the country which currently has the most innovative scientist technology and money to invest on science researches in the world, the United State certainly has the power and duty to keep the science going forward and let eh world benefit from science. We as science student with foreign citizenships are looking forward to the opportunities to stay here to bring the science to the real life and benefit the entire population of the United States and the world. The money that the government are spending on our social welfare and medicine and turning into a much bigger wealth of medical and pharmaceutical technology output and achievement that even those objectors are receiving benefits from. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zinnia Kong", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15459", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "To be a stronger nation, is not based on narrowing the number of International workers, but oppositely, depending on the diversity wisdom and multi-culture. \n\nOn the other hand, mostly international graduates have higher degree and do high-tech cool things, which bring powerful energy to our country and do not hurt the rights of guys who just can collect rubbish and make coffee. \n\nOur country need them and ought to give them more time to make contribution for our nation! \n\nSo I strongly SUPPORT the extension of OPT!!!!!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Brown", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19670", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Hello Sir/Madam,\n\nI would like to express my complete support for the proposed STEM OPT extension rule. This rule would greatly alleviate the US tech industry's shortage for right talent. The industry is already feeling it difficult to hire the right talent and retain them. US being number one destination for international students seeking quality education and exposure, it attracts lot of young and diversified talent from across the globe, it makes no sense to let go these highly trained and capable students and not to use their skills to make this nation economically and technologically more powerful. A careful glimpse at the number of international students contributing to the research and development in the universities and industry shows how valuable their services are to this nation.\nThe argument which says international students taking away the jobs of local Americans is not true at all. These students do not get any reservation for jobs in any sector. They are hired solely based on their skills and competency. Without the right skills and knowledge of the technology, no industry would be interested in hiring any candidate either local Americans or international graduate. Having the right skill is the key for getting hired.\nI am glad that DHS is driving this proposal promptly to get to final stages. Having said that, I would like to express my concerns regarding the implementation of this rule. In section B (STEM Extension Period for OPT) DHS says that it lacks authority to approve any cases after 13-Feb-2016, and would consider different options to deal with the situation. I would like to stress on the point that almost all the students (Bachelor, Graduate, Doctoral) who graduated in Dec14 - Jan15 would have their 12 month OPT end date in Jan16 - Feb16. In case of a delay in implementing this rule before the deadline, what would be the status of the students who still have their applications pending? How can they maintain status before they are approved under the new rule? I therefore request DHS to please consider the situation of such students and make provisions accordingly so that they maintain status and leverage the OPT STEM extension under the new rule. Getting this rule into implementation before 13-Feb-2016 is the key factor in avoiding all the chaos caused by student statuses.\n\nThank you \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Prashanth Giri", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1522", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n\n1.

Thus, there is no doubt that their capability of handling high-grade tasks with superior difficulty is remarkable. This will surely make huge profits for American economy and the whole society. These talents, if can stay in the U.S.A. for a longer time, will influence deeply on many aspects of th country. We have little reason to reject the opportunity for the technological and economic booming. Also, some people may argue that more students in America seeking for jobs will lead to fiercer competition, which may increase the rate of unemployment. But I would say the competition is a good thing for it will promote people in US, no matter domestic people or nonimigrant students, to strive for their jobs. I believe this will make the American society to thrive and be more productive. Fianlly, America is a country with diverse culture and human race. It should be more tolerant of different people as long as it will not do harm to the national security.

It is known to all that the huge amount of international students have made significant contributions to the development of many US companies, especially those technology oriented companies. If this proposal can't be approved, then those companies will suffer a lot from lack of sufficient talented and hard-working workers to make the stable improvement of the leading techniques, which is also a bad thing for the US society.\n\n(2) The most attractive part of US is its diversity. Only by allowing a combination of people from totally different cultures can the society be active. Different backgrounds and different experiences can produce different thoughts, inspire different insights. If international students are not allowed to stay here, then the US society will lose the chance to select the essence from other cultures.\n\n(3) OPT policy is a selling point of the US educational market. By allowing students to work here, students can develop real world skills by actual experience and raise their competitiveness in job market, which is the main reason why international students come to US seeking for more opportunities. Those who blame this policy should ask themselves why they fear this, maybe the answer is that compared to international students, they are not good enough. International students can make the job market more competitive, which I think is not a bad thing.

I am a international graduate student in Pittsburg state university kansas.I had a very good graduate program and i would likely to have a greater time in expanding my knowledge through opt extension. 95% of PITT state graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.\n \nI strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months\nI am planning to use OPT after graduation.\nThe extension helps the student in making them wide open in the knowledge of their interest. Im pretty sure students will come and get more opportunties with this 24month extension rule.\n \nI am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.\n \n \nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.\n \nBest regards,\nSachin S\nPittsburg state university\nMET electronics\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sachin  S", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10711", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT is very important to attract international students to study in USA.

I'm an international graduate student from China and working at a U.S company. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, when I first thought about going abroad to pursuing a more advanced degree, I considered to go Hong Kong, Europe, Canada or USA. There are too many options, but finally I made my decision to come here is mainly because of the opportunity of practice. Compared to other places, American, as an immigration nation and the biggest economic body, provides the most attractive working experience. So extending STEM OPT to 24 months will attract more and more international students. I seriously considered the opportunity offered by STEM OPT extension when I made my decision whether to pursue my degree in the United States.\n\nDuring the past two and half years I've been here, I've already spent over $100K for tuition, rent, shopping, traveling, etc. And I also invited my parents and friends to come for traveling. There is no doubts that we have helped the whole country's economic situations. Nobody will deny that. if that is not true, why almost all of the universities want to involve more and more international students? Because they made a lots of money from our spending. No one could deny the economic increase we brought to the local development. If there is no OPT extension, there will be less and less international students, which would be a great pain for the whole nation.\n\nCurrently I'm working at a consulting company and doing a project with a top pharm company, helping them to increase the efficiency of operations. This project will last for 2 years at least. If my opt expires on next Feb, it would bring a lot of pain no matter to myself, my company, or my clients. And there are lots of my colleges also working under OPT. if all of our OPT expire on next Feb, my company will lose the trust from our clients, the business would be impacted terribly. And the CEO might consider shut down the business. It would be even worse for the American employers. Cutting off our working opportunity will also impact your own citizens.\n\nThe company I'm working at is considering extending the service from United States to other countries. India, China are certainly the most promising markets. Having us here could help them to know the foreign markets much better and to develop the business there much easily. Building branches overseas will definitely help increase the overall tax income of U.S..\n\nWhen talking about our existence decreased the likelihood of the American people could find a job. It's definitely not true. Because all of the companies we got hired are through the e-verify program. The e-verify program prevents unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. So the criterion for a company hires people is not based on there race or nations, is purely based on the skills.\n\nI believe here is a land of freedom and equity.

The fields in which the STEM students will be employed are cutting edge industry where the states definitely need to develop.  The skill sets that a STEM graduate acquires are extremely precious for all high tech fields such as data mining, 3D printer, or neuroscience that America or any country in the current world seeks as new economic growth points. These STEM students will be leaders in the field, which will bring into billions of revenues in the following decades. If these future tech leaders are not allowed to seek employment in America, I am pretty sure that other countries such as China or India will be really happy to take them to develop their own industry. In the next couple of decades it is foreseeable that they will surpass US on these new emerging fields, as well as other fundamental traditional STEM fields that are crucial for homeland security such as airforce or defense technology. Moreover, deporting them today will very likely turn them into a generation with hatred to the US, with well-equipped high tech knowledge that will be extremely dangerous to us in the future. Bin Laden is a STEM graduate. I cannot understand that some Americans can be so short sighted to only think about making their neighborhood less crowded and do not care about the effect that it may bring to the security and well being of our next generation!\n\nA STEM PhD needs at least 9 years for education. The US universities have thrown in a tremendous amount of time, money and effort to educate them and equip them with the most cutting edge knowledge, before they are ready to contribute and pay back to the society. And now you tell me that after years of educational effort, America is going to lock them outside and let them use the knowledge and skills that we taught them to contribute to the economy of other countries, including our enemy? For those countries it is a big, big deal to get a generation of well-trained, talented and competent workforce for future economy and defense development without paying anything on their education, which is already covered by America, who got nothing out of it and will be the biggest loser in the game.\n\nI am not trying to bring hatred of the Americans to the STEM students. These lovely young people are well educated and have talented minds that will benefit any countries in the world. They are not taking away jobs, instead they are creating billions more of new jobs in the future generation of industry.

That is, if two students have similar academic achievements, one of whom is US citizen and the other is foreigner, then US universities will definitely admit the US citizen FIRST. So those international students admitted by US universities are generally smarter than the average US students US universities admitted. So the common occurrence is that most of the students who earn a GPA of 4.0 in US universities are international. As a result, to make US universities contribute more to US economy, those smart international students must be given permission to work in US to contribute to US industry.\n\n2. Industry need more smart employees to develop. As I said in the above paragraph, international students are generally smarter than US citizens in the same universities. So US industry need those smart people.\n\n3. Giving international students more permission to work can prevent them from returning to their own countries to compete with US. It's a foolish to train a smart student and then tell them to return to our competitors. Although US is the greatest country in the work but recently its status is being challenged by countries like China. OPT extension can prevent smart people from returning to China and promote their ability to compete.\n\nSome opponents may claim US has enough STEM graduates and many US STEM graduates work in non-STEM field. I cannot agree with them because:\n\n1. There are many reasons why many US STEM graduates don't work in STEM field. Some of them may be that other fields are more profitable than STEM field. For example, many MIT STEM graduates work as real estate agents, which is NOT a STEM field. Because many real estate agents have much higher salaries than STEM field. The house prices in San Francisco is extremely high. Selling a house with price of 2 million dollars in San Francisco can give 120 thousand dollars to the agent. If an agent can sell 10 houses per year then he can earn 1.2 million dollars, which is much higher than if he/she remains in STEM field. So many US graduate volunteer to go to non-STEM field because of a higher salary. So many US STEM graduates work in non-STEM field does NOT lead to the conclusion that US has enough STEM graduates.\n\n2. Even if there are enough STEM graduates, it still does NOT mean every sub-field in STEM has enough graduates. For example, US is in shortage of graduates with Computer Science major. That's why most of the H1B and EB green cards are given to Computer Science workers, while there are quite few workers in other STEM field are given H1B or EB green card. So it's necessary to give more working permission to Computer Science students to meet the demand of US labor market, even if there are enough STEM graduates in field other than Computer Science.\n\nBesides, the new rule proposal does a very good job in preventing employers from hiring cheap international students because it requires the wage of OPT graduates cannot be lower than US graduates. It's very good.\n\nFinally, I want to propose some minor changes to the new rule:\n\n1. It seems employers are required to provide something like training plans for OPT students. I don't think that's necessary because every employer have plans for their employees, even if their don't submit it to USCIS. This step is completely redundant.\n\n\nThank you ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhehao Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2217", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposal as it will fulfill the engineering vacancies with qualified people.

The companies have to pay extra fees to apply for H1b visa and it is not guaranteed.

There are at least three benefits to the country and its economy.\n\nSTEM OPT extension will help preserve the talent people with a higher probability. These highly educated people will help a lot in making the US more stronger. For example, in the IT industry, many talented foreign engineers contribute their knowledge to the US IT industry development. No one would defense today's fast development of internet in US has no related with these group of people. The same story can also be found in the science, technology and mathematics fields.\n\nI found someone said that STEM helps the foreigners take the possible job opportunity away from the natives. This is totally a wrong and negative thought. If the amount of native people majored in these fields can satisfy the market demand, and also they are smart and excellent enough to take these jobs, then how can the companies choose to hire some of foreigners instead of the natives? Apparently, the above two conditions are not satisfied. So keep the foreigners is actually helping these industries moving forward. Otherwise, you can imagine when the STEM is canceled, some related companies will lost a lot of employees, how can they continue to run the business with such a big hole.\n\nAlso, the promising employing for foreign people also encourage more and more students come to US. That also benefits US education a lot. The high tuition from international students facilitate the universities to run better. In this perspective, the native students with relatively low tuition are the biggest winner. \n\nTo sum up, the way to protect US people's benefits is not to keep the foreigners and also the foreign culture outside of US. The right way is to welcome and learn the good part from them. Keep fighting against it will only make the nation go backward.

Of course, the ambiguous language is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law.\n\nThe Regulation failed to mention the most obvious documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers are the employers payroll and personal records. What an employer is paying his current employees is direct and relevant evidence of how and what the employer values competent work. Instead, the Regulations allows the employer to hide the documents that it actually relies on and use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys, to set compensation for their U.S. workers. In short, the Regulations allow the employer and DHS to ignore reality (I.e. what is actually happening) ad substitute fantasy (i.e.what the employer and DHS hope is happening.)\n\nThe Regulations describe employers hiring high skilled STEM OPT students, thus accepting as fact that foreign students are already highly skilled in spite of the reality that the Regulations have already stated that the need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced foreign student.\n\nFurther, the Regulations would not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business but, in stead, would open such definitions to the world by providing the Department of Labors Office of Foreign Labor Certification.\n\nThe Regulations fail to protect U.S. workers because the Regulations fail to gage the wages of U.S. workers. In stead, the Regulations help ONLY the imported foreign students in gauging compliance, employers would be required to provide DHS with student compensation information, which would better situate the agency to monitor whether STEM OPT students are being compensated fairly.\n\nIf the DHS cared to protect the U.S. worker, then, the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. EMPLOYEE. That would protect the U.S. worker.\n\nThe regulation provide for on site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should/must conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet BOTH the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S.workers is in any way adversely impacted. Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the PAST FIVE (5) YEARS WITH NAMES, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS.\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers. The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.\n\nFinally, the Regulations fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regulation, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for fraud leaves the victimized American still goes without proper compensation.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Brad Parsons", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4575", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "A good idea leads to a better nation, I strongly support the rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Smith", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5602", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is important for those F1 student to gain more skills.

However there is no written updates on SEVIS yet. The SEVIS says before school staff makes a recommend for opt extension, he must make sure the student has already finished his thesis.

This has put students like me in a dilemma. On our I-20, the program's CIP (Classification of Instructional Program) is one of the followings:\n\n09.04) Journalism.\n09.0401) Journalism.\n09.0402) Broadcast Journalism.\n09.0404) Photojournalism.\n09.0499) Journalism, Other.\n\nThis makes us only eligible for a 12-month Optional Practical Training (OPT) instead of a 29-month OPT or this upcoming 36-month OPT for students in so-called science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. That might have reflected reality a couple years ago before the digital revolution took place, but nowadays, journalists really must learn coding as well, meaning programming languages such as python, in addition to understanding HTML5, Flash, CSS, adapting story to display on smart devices, etc. \n\nAs a matter of fact, New York University has recognized this and turned their journalism program CIP to 09.0702 Digital Communication and Media/Multimedia as explained at http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&cipid=87221 which would then qualify them for the 29-month or upcoming 36-month OPT as indicated by http://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2014/stem-list.pdf. My Columbia Journalism School is reluctant to coordinate with its ISSO to change this to benefit current and future students fearing this is a foul play by NYU. \n\nI am writing also because it takes a lot of time to break into the media industry. Even Laura Dimon, the daughter of JPMorgans CEO Jamie Dimon had to go on a series of freelancing and/or unpaid internships to eventually land a salaried position at CBSNews. Just imagine how hard that might be for international students whose mother tongue is not English but who knows coding. You might say why dont we just go back to our home country. As an alumnus who has seen the broken immigration system broke so many dreams of international students studying journalism in the U.S. and fearing the return to their home country to carry on the vigorous reporting, I am writing to make our voices heard. I will not benefit from this reform because I am a U.S. citizen now and it does not matter to me anymore. But I cannot bear the thought of this practice continuing to hurt courageous international students who could become the next James Foley or Steven Sotloff. For a more graphic story on our plight, please refer to this 10-min documentary at http://narrative.ly/meet-the-press/dreams-of-a-different-beat/.\n\nI have been thinking that this addition of journalism to the STEM list has to be changed by DHS so that the sanctity of journalism could be protected. It is no longer just about writing he said vs she said thru interview. It has to rely on data to fact-check the stories and make them more informative and compelling. President Obama has repeatedly mentioned how he appreciates the freedom of the press at the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner. I hope you have the courage to help convert journalism CIP into STEM-qualified as well so that we could have more journalists from other countries coming to report America back to their home audience. This will help spread democracy and American values. Believe it and make the change retroactively so that someone with unexpired OPT could benefit from the upcoming new rule after the comment period.

The only reason you cannot find job is your low ability not because of the foreigners! Lots of American who opposite the policy would never think about the US`s development tendency, they just hope the government leave all the job opportunities for themselves. If the STEM extension is canceled, it would cause a big effect to the US in many fields, such as the amount of international students would be decreased a lot, so the income for the education system would also be reduced, because the International students` tuition is more expensive then the native students, it is the main income for these universities all the time, and some STEM majors such as CS and engineer would also lost competitive power than before. Secondly, so many big technology companies would lost lots of talent people right away! And these position cannot be filled immediately, so it will cause big economic loss for these companies. Finally, I think the OPT students cannot be any effect for the local people, because according to my experiences, I think most of companies would like to employ the American citizens first, actually our international students have very less competitiveness than the American citizens. \n\nI have to say that the STEM students are very IMPORTANT for the US development, they can do many hard works, which the American or other majors` students cannot do.

This is not the purpose of OPT. Second, after landing their jobs, students work maximally one year in the United States. If you put this in a time span under an organization. At this stage the new graduates just go through the initial training, officially become adept entry level employees. If they leave at this time, would be a loss to both the companies and them. I doubt companies would have enough time and interaction with the recent graduates to evaluate if they would sponsor them, based on the fact that the chance to get H1B is low. This situation gives company a higher pressure to hire an international student at the first place.

It's very common that when a student studied in US go back to his/her own country after graduation, companies requires at least 3-5 year working experience to be considered competitive. A fresh graduate with few experience will almost obviously not be paid as well, or even won't be considered comparing to another candidate with good experience from a well developed industry like US. And a 24 month extension gives a good time window for graduates to build their experience. Currently the time window for opt extension is 17 months, however the second 5 month will not count toward another year in their resume, therefore a 24 month extension could in fact be very meaningful. Because in fact, having an opportunity to gain good and long enough working experience and become more competitive in the job market is one of the most important reason that a foreign student choose to study in US over other countries. Many international students from my master program are attracted by the opt and opt extension policy and came here paying over $40,000 tuition every year, let alone their rents, cars and other daily expenses that stimulates US economy and create jobs indirectly. Just so they could gain some experience before there is a good opportunity for them to go back to where their family were and find a good job with better salary to support their life. You cannot expect an education program to be competitive if it ask their student to pay such a high tuition while kicking their students back to where they came from after they graduate. International student are expecting their future salary to pay back when they are paying a much higher tuition than other country's education program. There are many good programs around the world in Japan, Great Britain, Australia and etc. if it is not for the OPT and extension policy in US, the number of international students would tremendously decrease and colleges and universities will need to find some other way to support its funding. They will need to charge a much higher tuition to US citizen students and stop giving out generous scholarships for those who are qualified but need financial aid. This would put an even higher burden on families with kids going to college. I think this is a very smart win-win policy that should be approved. It will definitely work to help US to stimulate its education industry directly and its economy as well as job market indirectly.

However I don't think their reasons could make sense. \n\n1. A lot of comments say \"hiring the students will reduce the minimum wages\", is that right? I don't think so. \nHere is my argument: \nAmong the students working with STEM OPT visas, a lot of students are in Electrical Engineering major and computer science major. Me and a lot of my friends holding OPT visas are working in Silicon Valley. In silicon valley, the minimum wage for entry level Electrical engineer is about 90K USD per year. Computer Engineers could get even higher salary. In Google, Facebook, Linkedin etc, the entry level software engineer could get something close to 180K USD package (Sign on bonus, relocation fee, base salary, stock) in the first year. As far as I know, this salary is higher than the US average salary. In other parts of US, the salary for STEM students might be lower but it is still higher than US average salary. Even some people holding STEM OPT visas may work with a lower salary, but I don't think the percentage is high. I don't think it is a good idea to kick out all of us just because few of us could tolerate their work with wages lower than minimum salary for US citizens. To support the option \"hiring the students will reduce the minimum wages\", we may need a survey regarding how many OPT students work with salary lower than the minimum wage requirement. Without such a survey, the statement \"hiring the students will reduce the minimum wages\" is groundless. \n\n2. Some people also comments \"US citizen pay tax to support foreigners, which is not fair for US citizens\" \nThe reason for OPT students pay less tax than US citizens is mainly because of they don't enjoy so much benefits as US citizens. They do pay the tax they need to pay for the country. Regarding the tax, you guys should question IRS but not DHS. \n\n3. I also saw a lot of comments saying that \"Work opportunities should be open to US citizens but not foreigners\". \nMy question is: Does the US has enough resource for that kind of job right now? When I was looking for a job, I found a lot of positions only open to green card holder or US citizens in the career fair. It seems not too many companies want to hire OPT students because they couldn't work in the company for longer than 29 months without further sponsership. Sometimes the program could take more than 3 years and it is not good for a students with OPT visa to participate. If the company couldn't find the right candidate with US citizenship, they have to find some OPT holders as a substitution. \n\nIn my company, I know some positions needs candidate urgently and sometimes they even have to pay high relocation fee to hire somebody from Europe. If they could find the right candidate locally, I don't think it make sense for the company to do so. \n\nFrom my point of view, F1 OPT students are making a lot of contribution to US society right now. In Apple, Google, Facebook, Linkedin. etc, there are a lot of employees holding F1 visa. They are making great contribution to the company, making the company grow up and hire more employees. Laying off them right now might cause a disaster to the company. If the company come to a bad shape, it is not good for US citizens as well because there are also a lot of US citizens in STEM area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tianxiang Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18282", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "International students are coming to United  states because of gain practical knowledge.

Some commenter insist that company tend to hire international students in a low salary. However this is not the fact. Employer will be sued if discriminate the international students and hire them in a low salary. What is more, if the OPT extension is canceled, a lot of international students will give up pursuing college or master degree in America. Many Chinese students had a  chance to pursue master degree in many countries, such as Canada, Hong Kong and so on. OPT is the most attraction for them(including me). In fact, most students in China just want work experience in the US and then go back to China. They have family, friends over there. An extension of OPT will attract them more. A one year in company can help them a little. Maybe one can just get adjust to the life in company and learn nothing before he leave the company and devoted to the company. Company can not give international students big tasks because one year can make little effort to a huge tasks. But a 12 months regular + 24months will solve the technical problem. So I think a STEM OPT extension is beneficial to the company as well.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by zhenjie lin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17494", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think they deserve this chance to get more oppoturnity.

It is no doubt that the US has the best academic institutes and resources in STEM fields. STEM people in the US are focused on promoting the improvement of human knowledge and quality of life, which is the ultimate objective of people over the globe and should not be limited by nationality. In a fast changing world where new and urgent challenges are taking place, cooperation and communication should be an easy and fast way to gain achievements.\n\nI chose to study in the US because no other countries can offer me such opportunity of \"cooperation\". In fact, current prosperous state of the STEM fields in the US has proved that it is never done by one person or one group of people. It is exactly because of people from various cultural backgrounds and with different inspects that lead to the richness and possibilities of new findings and developments in STEM fields. Thus I really hope this proposal will be approved because 1 year will not be enough for proper cooperation. Seriously, most of the time, an STEM project is in its starting phase in it's first year.\n\nIn addition, for international students who intend to go back to home country like me, a well-strained 3-year of working can be a valuable experience after going back home. These group of people have direct experience of cooperation and are probably most aware of the strength of diversity. It is very possible that a much larger scale of cooperation and communication can be established by these people and thus more working opportunities will be created.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by YY Gan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21116", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Wanted to let you know that I'm not a happy camper when it comes to Department of Homeland Security's recommended rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. \n\nIt's my understanding that it will allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay PLUS they don't have to pay a prevailing wage. \n\nThis is BS! \n\nGot an idea for you... how about giving companies this tax break if they hire American grads and citizens first?  This is what you'd really do if you REALLY cared about our nation!\n\nIf companies had this option would they hire US qualified American workers when they've got an \"out?\"\n\nIt's also my understanding that foreign student's pledge to RETURN HOME after graduating when they get their F-1 visa.  Therefore isn't hiring these students against the law, or is this just another typical Obama administration and Dem party choosing what laws to follow and what laws to blow off ...again?  \n\nConsidering that our government doesn't have a system in place to deport those who over-stay their visas,hiring such students potentially just adds to the immigration problems as well.\n\nWhy in the hell do you think we're paying the high college tuition required?   Why do you think college kids are taking out exorbitant loans to go to college when they think they'll be hirable upon graduation?\n\nIs it perhaps that our colleges and universities are doing a CRAP job of educating our children well enough to satisfy the needs of tech companies?\n\nIf this is the case why is the government giving these institutions a pass to keep creating what equates to miss-educated incapable graduates considering that many of them get our tax dollars as well?\n\nWith recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign workers over U.S. citizens.\n\nDo you know how much these companies charge US citizens for their products and services as compared to many foreign countries?  Bet if you take a good look at it you will see that it's US citizens who pay more.\n\nSo citizens pay taxes, pay higher prices for goods and services, and have college grads who will be turned down for foreign labor all so that tech companies can grow and prosper on the backs and blood of citizens & the country who were the ones to give them their start in the first place!\n\nWhose side are you on?

I'm a Ph.D student majored in Math. Before I came to US, I have other options such as an offer at Oxford University in UK. But I had always wanted to come to US for graduate study because I knew US has the most friendly environment for foreign students and the 17-month work opportunity of OPT. US is now the most attractive country for the most talented students because of this. In my case, the top 20% students from the my undergraduate university (top 3 in China) would choose to come to US for graduate study. This trend is the key to the successful research of the US universities. If we do not have the OPT extension, I believe most students would choose other options. It certainly would discourage the most talented students from all over the world to come and contribute to US. US is known to be the most open-minded country and it encourages people from all over the world to come and do their best to serve this country. I think it's the spirit of US, and I admire this spirit very much! The OPT extension would send the message of this spirit and attracts more young and talented students to come and do the most cutting-edge research both for themselves and for US!!!\nAs a STEM graduate student, I'm doing the most advanced research in my grad school and I certainly would like to apply my knowledge after my graduation in a company or research facility in US. Most of the international students in my department are in the same situation as me. Many research projects would last 2 years and without the OPT extension, we wouldn't get enough time to apply our knowledges in US companies. If we are forced to choose other companies in other countries because we don't have the OPT extension here, I believe it's a huge lost for US high-tech companies. \nIn all, I believe the OPT extension is a smart decision and it would benefit both the US technology and the STEM students like me.

I have following reasons:\n\n1. I believe the purpose of having OPT program is to not only help International students to gain work experience after graduating from college, but more importantly to allow U.S. companies having chances to keep the good talents in the US and further help the U.S. grow. U.S. has been prospering in science and technology, it is not only because we have one of the world's best education system and first-class universities, but also lots of brilliant immigrants from all over the world working in U.S. companies. They bring in different perspectives and skill sets to make the U.S. prosper. In addition, the current 29 months (which has been vacated...) is one of the main reasons that international students coming to Unites States instead of other countries. Without it, those students won't be motivated to come and may be go to other more welcoming countries. In the long term, you may be seeing a big shift in international labors and the competence of Unites States in technology and science field may no longer be the strongest. I think neither you nor I want to see that happen.\n\n2. Most of the arguments against this policy lands on stealing job opportunities from American citizens, which is poor grounded without any evidences. First of all, jobs are equal to everyone, as long as you have the skills you can get the job. That's also one of the main reasons U.S. attracts lots of talents, people here are equal to compete, no discrimination, no advantage, but equality. Admitted, international students do make the job market more competing, but it only makes the U.S. companies more competitive in the global market and makes the country stronger. Furthermore, even this policy doesn't pass and fewer international students will compete with American citizens in the job market, most companies won't lower their bar for their jobs just because there are fewer applicants. And even they do lower the bar to hire less qualified people, the companies' performance and competitiveness will decrease, and I'm sure neither you nor I want to see that happen too.\n\nToday we are living in a globalization world, the country who have most talents in the world is able to lead the world in terms science, technology and most likely also economy. The U.S. policies currently is proving that the country is doing what a world leader should do. And the its OPT policy one of the important puzzles for U.S. to lead and prosper. Why do we remove something that is functioning well and benefiting the country? Please consider this policy carefully, if it doesn't pass it means from next February hundred thousands of international students will immediately lose their job and identity in the U.S., not to mention a greater amount of international students who will graduate in the future.

The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is nobody's definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students.\n{NOTE: U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.}\n\nTo guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. This is deceptive. The Regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S.worker. The Regulation deflect the issue away from this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same {undefined} size anywhere in the world.Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student.\n\nThe Regulations define similarly situated as U.S. workers in other employers {not other employees of the same employer} of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area {which will be strictly construed} of employment. Similarly situated U.S. workers would include U.S. workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the STEM OPT student.\n\nIn Short By Definition There Are No Similarly Situated U.S.Workers Ensuring That No One Will Meet This Definition So The Employer Can Never Be Liable For Replacing Any U.S. Worker.\n\nThis Regulation is designed to leave the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers thus, giving the employer an excuse/alibi to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign student.\n\nThe Regulation does not care if the student is taught anything at all because the Regulation leaves it to the UNTRAINED employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for STEM OPT students. The employer is in business not education.\n\nIt Is Noted That The Regulation Does Not Refute That The U.S. Has Plenty Of Home Grown Scholars And Stem Student.\n\nThe Regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign student. Instead, the Regulation leaves it to the imagination of the employer DHS anticipates that employers have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices. Of course, the ambiguous language is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law.\n\nThe Regulations describe employers hiring high skilled STEM OPT students, thus accepting as fact that foreign students are already highly skilled in spite of the reality that the Regulations have already stated that the need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced foreign student.\n\nThe Regulations fail to protect U.S. workers because the Regulations fail to gage the wages of U.S. workers. In stead, the Regulations help ONLY the imported foreign students in gauging compliance, employers would be required to provide DHS with student compensation information, which would better situate the agency to monitor whether STEM OPT students are being compensated fairly.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Roy Smith", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4530", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a very positive and great regulation that will benefit the US society and economy.

My husband is a STEM worker and his wages were severely cut as a graduate  with 2 degrees Univ of // Engineering School and Computer Science.\n\n. My Husband retired, forced to retire early because of foreign workers taking the open engineering jobs or working for less pay.\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\nBackground of spouse to show he is accomplished engineer:   \n\nEarly career he worked on optical scanner . The devbeloment hardware and software enabled to read sender's  writing on envelopes and tell the sort machine what to do.\nNot too much problem early in his career with foreign workers.\nProblems came later in his career.\n\nOne of his last engineering jobs was a solo effort. He made millions of dollars for the company.  He developed software used in telecommunications.\n\nI might add with pride that he met many American engineers who are as capable as he.  He met the inventor of a certain phone technology.  Inventor is A normal American guy working out of a smaller company in a smaller city.  Company gained huge profits from invention, not the engineer.  \n\nSpouse lost out of many jobs to foreign workers.  And settled for less money. He retired early because of foreigners.  I surmise you probably think something is wrong socially or emotionally with American Engineers to let their jobs be taken over by foreigners.  Not my husband. He is bright  conversationalist.  Anyways I enjoy engineering types.  fascinating, loving people.  \n\nI want to add foreign tech workers aren't able to grasp the finished concept of projects as American Engineers do.   foreigners needed lots of help on projects from American Engineers.  Some foreigners couldn't meet deadlines, and when asked questions about deadlines or get fired they would magically appear with the software code in a few days time>  The software code the foreign workers couldn't explain how it worked.  Conclusion is  the foreign workers got help at nite or farm the needed code out to more capable engineer and claim it as their own the next morning.\n\nAs I said in the beginning I am the wife of an American Degreed Engineer. His college B+ GPA Grade Point Average from BIg 10 school was B from engineering school.  I, myself, viewed the engineering occupation thru my job.  16 employed years at Univ library Science and Engineering.  I met foreign EE and Computer Science students.  The atendees I met during teaching Seminars affirmed my belief American Engineer can do the job better and faster than foreigners who can't grasp the finished concept project.   \n\nMany American engineers we had as friends decided they would have been better off financially working in different occupations  as school teachers because of engineer's low pay and frequent layoffs.\n\n  Because American engineers' jobs became temporary jobs labeled as project engineers.  Some American engineers leave profession to become lawyers, union manual jobs and teachers.   Please believe there is no shortage of engineers, only low paid shortage.  Look at new  Engineering graduates, where's the jobs???  Where are these working.   Instead of American workers at job site you might walk down the halls of engineering firms and see cubicles are filled with foreign workers because of high incentives to employers paid by the government. low wages to employee and lots of help from American Engineer. Low wages and frequent layoffs for American Engineer is what the foregn worker brings us. I surmise a decent wage for engineer would be $100,00 year but sadly it is temporary job with a mid level might make $55,000 a year and employed on project for 2 years then on unemployment and no work for a few years.

A study in 2009 demonstrates that foreign highly-skilled workers and students have contributed $13.6 billion GDP and about $3 billion taxes in the year of 2008 (Holen, A 2009). A large proportion of the foreign work force is largely beneficial to the innovation of US, which is a country built by diversity and innovation. Cutting the visa extensions for international students will severely damage the ability of importing talents for innovation in US tech companies. US economical prosperity will be diminished by losing the driving force of innovation.\n\n2) Another consequence of cutting off the OPT extension for US is that US universities will lose a large portion of tuition income. Most of the international students are financially self-supported in the US. These students have boosted the local economy by spending large amount of dollars in education and living. Not allowing international students to gain working experience in the US is as bad as saying Americans discourage international students who seek education opportunities. Lots of students will choose not to come to the US.

I categorically REJECT/WILL NOT ACCEPT your rule due to a lot of very concerning reasons. Also, please do a through investigation about what I am going to write here. I have nothing against OPT/H1B visas but DHS should check the misuse of OPT visas and H1B visas done by the consultancies/employers. For past 7-8 years this OPT extension rule and H1B visas were misused by Indian contractors/consultancies to such a horrifying extent.\n\nMassive visa fraud is happening in the broad day light done by Indian consultancies. They fake candidate's resume and select candidates who are in OPT claiming that they have H1B visa. They run fake pay rolls and hire mostly Indian grads from US universities who can't even speak proper English. These so called consultancies get projects from companies(subcontracted by them) by showing that they have a very strong experienced workforce with 5-10 years experience. Most of the interviews with contractors are done through Skype and questions are answered by an experienced guy who will be on loudspeaker during the interview. While the actual candidate will lip sync to proxy candidate's reply to interviewers questions. Companies have hired thousands of fake candidates now and some of them got fired. Consultancies/employers will lose that job contract as a result of this. But they will continue doing this as a candidate with US degree is their cash cow. These companies won't do background check properly and a person with a fake profile joins them. Within a span of 1 month they will be caught and kicked out. Some lucky ones stay there with the help of skilled proxies. These fake candidates will share their laptop screens with proxy worker sitting in India and get this work done. There are lots of fraudulent practices happening without the notice of officials and the industry.\n\nRecent examples are raids conducted by DHS on couple of Indan consultancy firms based in California and New Jersey. They arrested some Indian entrepreneurs who ran fake pay roll and employed candidates with fake experience. If you check the number of H1B visa applications you will realize the shocking number of applications that were duplicated by these con men.Within a year, the H1B applications will overflow to 300,000 numbers because most of these consultancies will put 3-4 applications to get their H1B selected. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and other companies that apply for more than thousands of H1 visa applications should be investigated as such companies employ less than 30 percent American citizens. Many jobs wouldn't go to genuinely experienced candidates.\n\nThis brain drain concept is completely ridiculous. I don't believe that USA as a great country needs foreign graduates to save economy or future of this country. Most of the foreign students especially Indian and chinese are here to make money and they don't come here to create jobs or create intelligent kids to save United States. It's a shame that United States as a great country can't control such frauds from taking advantage of this system. Please do a thorough investigation on such people and make OPT rules strict to prevent such malpractices by consultancies.\n\nIt is also important to save American jobs for American people. I would like to recommend that any employer should call foreign graduates only after they have interviewed a specific number of American candidates to make sure that the priority is given to American citizens. Please do the needful to stop these fraud Indian consultancies. Rather than giving OPT visas to all students who graduate here in USA, you should implement a system where students with good academic credentials directly benefit from system. Those who fake their credentials should be punished by cancelling the OPT and deporting them back to where they came from.\n\nPlease strictly enforce OPT visa holders to work in their corresponding fields they have their degrees based on. Recently, I have noticed that many of the mechanical engineering grads started working with these IT consultancies with fake profile and fake experience. Please take necessary steps to avoid such issues in future. Please stop them from changing companies during the OPT period. This will make sure that those who fake resumes to join a company will pay the price eventually. Stop graduates working with fake experience and taking away American jobs!!\n\nTo avoid faking resumes and profiles by these con artists, I hereby request DHS to enforce background check rules on these candidates before they even start their jobs. If you don't take care of concerns raised by American workers like me eventually this rule will be thrown out by another judge in the court. So I hope you'll address my concerns to implement a strong rule to avoid such fraudulent activities by foreign graduates and Indian consultancies.\n\nGod Bless United States of America!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mark Watson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8372", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the OPT extension for the STEM students.

The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\n2.\"\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\n3.\"\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\n4.\"\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael broderius", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8690", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "See attached file(s)", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sally Ellis", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9311", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Thanks to Homeland Security Department for working on this so hard.

They prefer to do whatever they want or whatever they are good at. For example, finance, investment and accounting are the jobs they want to do. In this case, there are a lot of vacancies of engineering jobs because only a few American people want to apply for them. However, IT field is one of the most important parts in the U.S. economy. Those IT giant companies need someone to work for them.  That is the most important reason of international students major in STEM should get OPT extension rather than others. \n\nIn addition, there are a great number of successful people in U.S. who make unbelievable contributions to the whole nation as well as the world are originally from other countries. Let me give you one example. David Ho, who was original from Taiwan, has been at the forefront of AIDS research for three decades. He championed the combination anti-retroviral therapy which had earlier been developed by scientists at NIAID and Merck. This approach allowed the control of HIV replication in patients. He is only one of thousands of people who dedicate to contribute to the U.S. and the world. Can you imagine how many students with OPT extension would do the same thing like them if they have a chance?\n\nMoreover, for those who complain OPT extension students occupy their job opportunity and students from other countries should go back home counties after graduate, I am more willing to call them loser. I believe these people are currently lying in the bed, doing nothing but complain. Equality is the one of the most important concept in a society in U.S. The most hard-working and excellent people can win the competition rather than the loser like this.  DHS continues to believe that the E-Verify program is an important measure to ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. The E-Verify program is an Internet-based service operated by USCIS, in partnership with the Social Security Administration (SSA). E-Verify is currently free to employers and is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. E-Verify electronically compares information contained on the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 (herein Form I-9) with records contained in government databases to help employers verify the identity and employment eligibility of newly-hired employees. This program currently is the best means available for employers to determine employment eligibility of new hires and, in some cases, existing employees.\n\nIn conclusion, I dont care how this OPT extension can benefit the international students. What I only care is this policy has great positive impact on US economy. Every policy that benefits the US should be supported.

Since the tuition in the U.S university is increasing, if we lose those international students then tuition for the domestic student will crazily increase. \n\n3.

This proposal is not only for the benefit of STEM international student, but also for the benefit of  United States. \nFor one thing, I think it's for the benefit of the education system of United States. Nowadays, one of the important reasons why the universities in United States can attract international students is that students can be authorized to work after graduation. As we all know, industrial experience is an integral part of education and even for some people is the goal of education. United States is always proud of its OPT policy that allows students to work after graduation. United States also has enjoyed the benefits of this policy with so many international students choose to go to US rather than United Kingdom, Germany, etc, which also have universities of high academic level and even longer history. It is undoubtedly that many students choose United States because they think they can put what they learn into practice in the industry after graduation, and United States can offer them a better industry practice than the other countries. Now if the OPT period is reduced to just one year which is obviously not enough for new graduates, many international students would rather choose to stay in their own countries or go to Europe or other countries. And we know some of these countries are actively issuing new policies to attract international students. This will definitely do harm to United States' education system, which has laid the basis for US's leading position for so many years. Looking back the histories we know education is always the prerequisite of the rise of a country. US's education system has attracted numerous talented students around the world, and these people helped to bring about US's prosperity for one century.

I commented on Benefits of International Students in the United States article.\n\nOur international students tuition fee is almost more than twice as expensive as that of residents. For example, I am a Master student in Electrical Engineering, and I spent 12794.14 dollars per semester for over nine credits as a non-resident. Meanwhile, a resident master student spent 6010.14 per semester for the same credits. My total expense per semester is more than two times than that of a resident. My parents paid my all expenses including the tuition fees and living expenses at the USA with money earned for more than ten years with a less than two-thousand dollars monthly salary in a small city at China. Because they want to provide me the best education, so they poured most of money into my education at the USA. Therefore, I have tried my best to study hard for two years because this opportunity is an exchange of my parents over ten years works. After studying at University with double tuition fees, our international students also need internships or work experiences as same as resident students. \n\n2. International students are very difficult to find an internship or a job in the USA compared to the citizens. For instance, I finished all my course works, and I will graduate soon. Now I am looking for an internship and last week I got two on-campus interviews from an IT company at my University. I got great interviews, and they said I impressed them a lot. I also applied for more than ten positions at that company. However, after interviews and many applications, I just received one by one reject email from the firm because they do not want to hire me because I can't work for a long time without sponsorship, even I can use 12 months plus 17 months extension. They even dont want to give me any further interview for any internship position because of sponsorship. In comparison, American citizens very easily got the further interview including on-site interview if they impressed the initial interviewer. I just want to mention that even though we had 29 months opt, we still have higher wall to get an offer from the US Company than citizens because of our work authorization limitation. Citizens have a great and incomparable advantage in getting jobs than international students with OPT extension.  \n\n3. I commented on STEM Extension Period for OPT article.\n\nIn this modern society including USA and China, graduates should have degrees and work experience both to get a chance to find a good job at the company. Studying in US University is a great challenge for us because of language so we should spend more time to study. Also, we spend more time and energy to prepare and find an internship or a full-time job at the US because many small or medium size US companies do not want to hire international students because of sponsorship. If we luckily get an internship or a full-time job at a firm, but only have one year or less time to work, and then we cannot have enough work experience or even no work experience at the US. After going back our home countries, we will be almost treated as same as or a little better than the graduates in China. Then there is no reason to spend 30000 dollars per year to study at the US instead of starting working in our home countries. If we have three years opt to find jobs and work, and then we have enough time to finish a companys project that will take around one to two years.

The truth is, when a company or an industry is able to recruit more talented people, they will be more competitive and have a better chance to expand and then hire more people, as we have seen from Apple and Google, and multiple other companies in the Silicon Valley. They hire a lot of foreign students, and what we have seen is that this invaluable talent pool help them to be stronger and they can keep on innovating, and then expanding to create more job opportunities. \n\nWhen the talented people (a lot of them are young foreign STEM students) are driven away from America, the center of innovation will also be driven out of America, and the job opportunities are then moved to other countries. During the Great Recession, due to lack of chance/funding, a lot of foreign students went back to their original country (such as China), and a lot of them have done great jobs in terms of scientific research and starting companies. These people and chance should be America's. \n\nSo the question is how do we allow more talented STEM students to stay, in order to keep America as the leader in STEM innovations, and thus the industry will be healthy and competitive and able to expand, to create more jobs for American people.

If the international students learn that even if they get education in US, they will have no chance to work here due to the policy. I doubt whether there will still be that many foreign students coming here.\n\nSecond, hiring international students doesnt mean stealing jobs from Americans. Most of the companies prefer to hire US citizens, so its more difficult for international students to get a job than Americans  do. Also, personally, the international students I know who could get jobs here are outstanding students and they are also paid with good salaries. Especially for those international students working in IT company, they are paying with salaries much higher than the American average salary. So the international students are getting jobs because they have solid skills and are qualified for the jobs. its definitely not true that companies are paying much less to hire international students so that Americans  are losing lots of working opportunities. \n\nWhats more, the IT sections in US need large quantities of talents. And there is no doubt that international students with a STEM degree are indispensable forces contributing to the boom of this industry.

I attended graduate school several years ago and met a friend who was majoring in computer sciences. Most of her classmates were international students, most of them were from India, and some were from China. They were intelligent, vivid and most importantly they brought tuitions and technologies. In California IT industries hire them, sign a 2-3 year contract with them, that is not only what they need, but also the industries need. A lot of students work in IT industries, work as engineers, supporting operations of websites, creating apps and make a lot of contributions to economy. Since IT stimulates economic developments I think it does more benefits than risks to give these international applicants chances to work in the U.S. The duration of extension is set at 2 years rather than limited to shorter that is after consideration of durations of research or development. I think DHS has taken many factors while determining this proposal. STEM students are encouraged to participate in relational fields which can both contribute experiences of their field of studies and contribute to economy. Industries, institutions and students all have their benefits.\n\nMoreover, international students make contributions to the U.S. by their tuitions and expenditures. If canceling the OPT extension the amount of STEM students will drop immediately for most students are expecting work 2-3 years in the U.S. before they go back to their home countries. Every year the amount of grants for STEM is great. If the OPT period is truncated a lot of students will give up attempts to find an internship or a full time job in the U.S. It will lead to a loss for U.S. taxpayers because we have lost their contributions thus returning from the investment need more time, which is not pleasant for tax payers. OPT does more benefits for middle classes -- the most tax payers. While they do not harm U.S. citizens because usually these opportunities only open to STEM students especially ones who attend colleges or graduate schools. For American citizen STEM students it does not really matter because most of job openings are only open to citizens. For other students it also does not really matter because these jobs are not ones that everyone can qualify.

I hope my feedback will be taken into consideration.\n\nToday, I would like to shed some light on students and their employers misusing OPT/OPT STEM Extension in the present IT world.\n\nI'm currently on H1-B visa and also hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from a State School. During my Master's program, I worked for an American Company on an Internship (CPT) and right after my graduation I had about 3 offers from American Tech IT Giants. I'm one among those lucky ones to be a part of a reputed company. \n\nHere is the most important part about my feedback - While I was working as an Intern (on CPT Work authorization), I had other students working along side me on the same project from various companies. The sad part however is these guys were all on OPT and projected themselves as Senior candidates with 7-8 years of IT Experience. At the least they weren't able to speak proper English during Weekly/daily stand up meetings. \nAt that time in 2011 as an Intern, I was making around $26 an hour for the same job with better skills and these guys were making roughly around $60/hr. I don't have have a problem with these guys making good money BUT I feel there are other well deserved candidates missing out on good opportunities due to lack of process background verification process by Government Agencies while issuing OPT/STEM Extension permits.\nThe worst part of all is that some of these students had graduated from non-IT fields such as Environmental Engineering, Mechanical and Bio-Chemistry and yet they have been successful at getting into IT with 7-8 years of experience and with ease. This is just the starting point for them, from here they work with so called \" Indian Consulting firms\" aka body shops to get their H1-B and Green Card process filed and try to stay ahead in the PERM process than the actual talent who's still struggling to make progress in their career with the right experience (not faking it). \n\nI would like to end this here with a humble request to the DHS: \n1. Please enforce a proper system to perform appropriate background checks on every Graduate student at the time of applying for OPT and specially during their STEM Extension process.  \n2. Kindly verify if the student applying for a STEM Extension is working in their area of study. It's sad to see an Engineer from an Environmental Engineer background working on an IT Cloud platform while this guy knows only about Cloud, weather and rain in the sky. \n3. There are lot of Consulting firms (Indian IT body shops) in every major city in the U.S. (specially in New Jersey, Texas and California) that are fooling the government agencies by running fake payrolls, generating fake experience letters while applying for H1-B and Perm. Please enforce stringent guidelines/regulations on such Companies. \n\nThank you for providing the Opportunity and God Bless America!\n\n\n\n \n\n      \n\n      \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Venkat K.", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2161", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The huge devotion from foreign students is undeniable.

I'm a computer science master student from China. I worked for IBM several years in china.

But finally I chose us. The most important reason is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. I can get the high quality education in British or Canada as ell, but working experience is more precious, especially for STEM, many things can not achieved in class. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I will recommend my friends to achieve their in British because its time is shorter. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, IBM etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. We will create huge wealth for us and we can get valuable working experience as well, Such a great rule! \nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at IBM, most large software development projects would last at least 2 years or more like Emptoris.

As stated in the proposed rule document, this extension \"will enhance students' ability to achieve the objectives of their courses of study by gaining valuable knowledge and skills through on-the-job training that is often unavailable in their home countries\".  Tuition for higher education is very expensive here in the US, especially for those Top-Rated universities.  The cancellation of the OPT Extension would discourage many talented students in STEM fields, who may turn to investigate their money in getting educated from other developed counties other than US.\n\nSecond, it is vital to extend the current 17-month to 24-month in order to maximize the benefits.  During my last job in an IT company, it took me as long as 8 months to get familiar with all aspects about my role and became proficient at work.  Some big projects took much longer to complete, and it would be a headache for every employer to find a substitute for an employee who is doing very well on his or her job, if he/she cannot get enough time to finish it just because the cancellation of this rule.\n\nOn the other hand,  the cancellation of the OPT extension would cause a terrible blow to the the US economy, especially for IT industry.  Mark Zuckerberg, the chairman and chief executive of Facebook, Inc.,  has penned a Washington Post op-ed in 2013:  \"To lead the world in this new economy, we need the most talented and hardest-working people. We need to train and attract the best,\" he wrote, \"Given all this, why do we kick out the more than 40 percent of math and science graduate students who are not US citizens after educating them?\"\n\nIn Donna Belmont's comment(ID: ICEB-2015-0002-6469), she claimed that \"Our country is being handed over to illegal immigrants while our own LEGAL citizens as well as our VETERANS are doing without !!!!\"  But this rule has nothing to do with \"illegal immigrants\" since what OPT students own are nonimmigrant visas.  At the end of the day, most of them would go back to his/her home country, while the others may choose to stay with a H1-B visa. This rule would increase the number of H1-B cap by no means, and the importance of H1-B visa program itself should be indisputable.  \"The H-1B visa program helps ensure that the best and the brightest talent from across the globe can boost our country's economic growth, expand opportunity, and create American jobs,\" FWD.us President Todd Schulte said in a statement.  And the research has also clearly demonstrated that high-skilled immigrants create additional American jobs once they get here to the United States.\n\nThere are a couple of other comments (e.g. ID ICEB-2015-0002-3450) arguing that this rule \"places foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition\", but this is untenable.  The 24-month extension happens after the regular 12-month OPT, and students can only work for E-Verified companies.  All those companies are guaranteed to be equal-opportunity employers, so it makes no sense to say that foreign persons are placed over the US Citizens by this new rule.  Even if \"There are way too many out of work US Citizens AND Veterans right now.\" is true, Im worried that those people may not be good substitutes for the international students who have graduated from top universities here and are competent enough to win themselves 24 more months to create value for their employers.\n\nIn addition, from a post on Quora (https://www.quora.com/Are-Americans-really-upset-that-foreigners-are-working-in-Silicon-Valley-And-tech-companies-are-filled-with-them), we can hear the voice of a hiring manager from a Silicon Valley based tech company that \"hiring someone from overseas with an H-1B Visa is a lot more work than hiring an American citizen.\" He concludes that \"Unfortunately, there's so much demand for talent, it's hard to find someone local who is willing to work for you, while it gets easier if you're willing to hire from all over the world.\"  \n\nFrom the same post addressed above, Alan Morrison, who has truly worked closely with those young foreigners, said that people like him are \"grateful that this place is such a magnet for educated foreign talent and welcome the younger demographic.\"  As a result, I believe that there's a much better \"problem\" to have for the countries where those young talents are from, that all the smart people fleeing to another country for better opportunities and never coming back, than what we are worried about here.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Maggie Nan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22317", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is truly a disgrace to support foreign students in high tech jobs over American Citizens.

For example, Amazon face around 2300 job vacancies on average a year. IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Oracle altogether have more than 10,000 vacancies a year. These vacancies require high-level technology labors and cant be filled in by limited domestic labors. Nowadays, international STEM students make up a large proportion of these positions and are making great contribution to the growth of these firms.\n\nWithout the OPT Extension, more students will have to leave companies instantly and thus wont be able to fill in the vacancies. This will greatly jeopardize those firms competitive and growth strategy.\nIn the future the new IT trend will focus on Internet of Things, Social Networks and Big Data, which are predicted to create trillion dollars for US economy. The STEM labors will inevitably become the mainstays of those IT giants. In this sense, STEM Extension has great significance for US future competitiveness.\n\n(2) STEM students can not only make contributions to US firms, but also create jobs through entrepreneurship.\n\nFrom 1990, STEM international labors contributed to 1/3 of US economy acceleration, helped improved average salary of US work force by several percents. It is also reported that every technology international labor can create additional 5 job vacancies. Whats more, many great entrepreneurs or scientists were previous international students. With STEM specialties, many students are actually more entrepreneurial and more likely to start successful high-tech businesses, which further boosted US economy.\n\n(3) US firms can benefit more when STEM students are better trained during OPT Extension period.\n\nWith OPT Extension, STEM students will have more opportunities to receive training on job and enhance their skills before taking a formal full-time offers. In this way, students are able to contribute immediately, so US companies can reduce their training cost and potentially other related cost, as well as improving their productivity and efficiency.\n\n(4) STEM consists of highly-skilled labor segments that wont hurt the job opportunities of average US domestic labors.\n\nBringing in more STEM international students can help US select better qualified talents, improve average US student competitiveness, and finally increase US global competitiveness in almost every industry sector. Furthermore, as stated above, STEM students can actually create jobs that will greatly benefit downstream job markets.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fangfang  Tang", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14009", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n1.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students is also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\n Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. \n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or master's degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 2006-2012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n\nAdmitted, international students' participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all - every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. \n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qing Deng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21331", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I Strongly support the new STEM OPT extension rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Abhilash Patil", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1748", "postedDate": "2015-10-23T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think the the extension of OPT for STEM fields to 24 months is crucial, not only to international students with higher degrees, but also to native Americans.

On the one hand, it helps to alleviate the ongoing shortage of high-skilled workers in STEM fields. On the other hand, it DOES NOT compromise the employment opportunities of U.S. citizens. \n\n1.Studies show that there is a shortage of workforce in STEM fields, and the OPT STEM extension allows more F-1 students to contribute to the workforce and thus alleviate the shortage.\n\n1) A 2012 report by President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found that there is a shortage of 1 million college graduates in STEM fields over the next decade. (Ref. 1)\n\n2) A 2014 study showed that it takes longer to fill job openings of STEM positions than non-STEM positions, indicating higher demand for STEM workers. For example, advertisements for job openings requiring a Ph.D. or other professional degrees in STEM fields last 50 days on average, compared to 33 days for non-STEM job vacancies. (Ref. 2)\n\n2.There is no substantiated evidence that the STEM extension will compromise the employment opportunities of U.S. citizens. \n\n1) Foreign STEM workers do not threaten the employment opportunities of U.S. citizens in STEM fields, given STEM fields currently have very low unemployment rates. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the total unemployment rate in 2014 was 6.2%, whereas the rates in various STEM fields were significantly lower. For example: computer and mathematical occupations, 2.7%; healthcare practitioner and technical occupations, 2.1%; architecture and engineering occupations, 3.1%. (Ref. 3) Similarly, a report by the National Science Foundation found that unemployment rate for doctoral scientists and engineers was 2.1% in February 2013, only one-third of the total unemployment rate of 6.3% in the same month. (Ref. 4) \n\n2) Foreign STEM workers can help create more job opportunities for natives. STEM workers receive higher salary than non-STEM workers (Ref. 5), and will spend their incomes locally to create more jobs. A 2014 study using data in 1990-2010 in 219 U.S. cities showed that increases of STEM workers in a city were associated with significant growths of wages paid to natives who are college educated (Ref. 6). Moreover, some foreign STEM workers would become the future founders or executives of big companies that create hundreds of thousands of jobs for natives. For example, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai was once a Master's student from Stanford University in a STEM field.\n\nIn conclusion, the new OPT STEM rule would retain more high-skilled foreign workers to fuel the economy and maintain long-term competitive advantage for the U.S., without compromising job opportunities of U.S. citizens. Therefore, I strongly support it. \n\nReferences\n1.\thttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_2-25-12.pdf\n2.\thttp://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/job-vacancies-and-stem-skills#/M10420\n3.\thttp://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat25.pdf\n4.\thttp://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf14317/\n5.\thttp://burning-glass.com/research/stem/\n6.\thttp://www.nber.org/papers/w20093\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Hubo Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16894", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the expansion of the OPT program.

It is really a valuable experience. However, because I only have one-year OPT time (I'm not a STEM student), many employers who were interested in me couldn't hire me as they were afraid that they might lose me in the next year, which would a loss and inconvenience for the company. So I missed a lot of wonderful work opportunities only because of my status.

Also, international students who working and living in the US are a huge driving force of the country's economy, as they will also need to pay taxes, and spending money for a living in the country. A lot of international students that i know, including myself, are also volunteering for the community to help build a better life here.\n\nHowever, if deprived of the OPT extension, I'm afraid that the international students' willingness to come to the states to study will also be discouraged, because they won't be have to able adequate time to practice what they learned at school to gain experience.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll all for the 24-month OPT extension proposal for STEM international students, and look forward to seeing this wonderful proposal gets approved to benefit both the international students and the United States.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yao Dong", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3375", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Highly support the proposal.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jo bs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa has reminded the President that, \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. T he Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nAlso, John Miano, an attorney representing tech workers has reported that the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mento ring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n There is a Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis who responds, \"On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.  If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\n Also,Richard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO reminds us that, \"Expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\n\n\nThese comments and facts speak volumes as to why this and other measures like it are counter-productive to our country.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Denise Johnson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3479", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Help Americans get jobs !!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sara Silva", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8720", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months.

On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.\nThe U.S. should let the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can continuously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S.  The dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industries could not have been so prosperous, e.g. IT. The science and technology is the key to the further advancement of the U.S economy which benefits everyone of Americans. So in order for the future economy, we should allow those students holding F-1 visa stay longer.\n\nAfter reviewing so many negative comments who object the proposed rule. I found something they have in common: they are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries.\n\nI don't think they have to worry about this at all. First, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. And OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. And those tech companies is risking potential loss of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles?", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bixin Peng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19489", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule of OPT extension.

This proposal gives STEM students, who normally need more time to practice and build a project thoroughly, an opportunity to both practice, achieve and contribute.\n\n2. I do not agree with some citizens who complain about the STEM students take away their jobs and I consider STEM students contributors.\n\nFirst, the STEM students are only legal to work in fixed positions related to their majors in their OPT training program. Not all STEM students could get a job but only the qualified ones.\n\nSecond, since STEM students only have limited OPT time, companies apparently prefer citizens to STEM students since they do no need to risk losing employees. But why companies still risk hiring STEM students? Because they there are not enough qualified citizens in STEM related positions. So it is not the STEM students who take away their jobs. I think that kind of citizens prefer to complain here and deprive the opportunities of STEM students instead of working hard to get qualified, which is unhealthy, both for those citizens or this country. \n\nThird, if I were a citizen, I would consider it a great thing that United States could attract these qualified STEM students to help and contribute to this country. They are great resources which could be used to make United States stronger.\n\n3. As conclusion, this proposal is a win-win both for United States and STEM student. For our country, we can fit the positions with qualified employees. These qualified employees have helped and will help our companies grow larger, which creates more job positions.

No statistic data has been proposed that US permanent residence suffered from losing their job only because of international STEM students working in US.

The graduate schools are pumping out eligible high skill work force but current immigration regulations make it very difficult for an international student to find a job in industry that fits his/her skill set. Even with my Doctorate degree from a reputed school, I had to search for a job for nearly a year, primarily because of the fact that I am not a permanent resident. I interviewed for nearly 30 positions during that time where the employer was impressed with my resume and skill set but could not hire me because I am not a citizen or a permanent resident.

First of all, It lacks data to support the argument, in fact, as far as I know, most OPT extention holder students are holding OPT because they failed the H1B lottery since the H1B cap can't fulfill the current industrial requirement for highly skilled employee. Thus the reality is most OPT extention holders DO MEET THE PREVAILING WAGE, otherwise how can their company file H1B application for them??\n\nBesides, if the OPT extention proposal is rejected, how about the student who is in OPT extention already? Sending them back to their home country immediately?? According to the uscis [1]'s report, in 2015 alone, there are more than 175000 applications for H1B while at most only 85000 (general + advanced degree) will be fulfilled. Let's say only 30% of the remaining are OPT students, that would be more than 30000! What does that mean for the industrial to lose 30000 employees for no reason? IT MEANS A DISASTER! \n\nTake an example of my company, currently we have two employee who are in charge of an very important project. Unfortunately they didn't win the H1B lottery last year and this year, so now they are in OPT extention status. If OPT extention is cancelled, we have to send them abroad, which really increase our operation cost.\n\nSo as a person who have been through this broken H1B system, given that is't not gonna be fixed in a short term, OPT extention is now the only panacea, I hope the government to take this OPT extention petition seriously. Please think through it, please think about how bad it could be if the OPT extention is cancelled.\n\nRegards,\n\n[1] http://www.uscis.gov/news/uscis-reaches-fy-2015-h-1b-cap-0", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yifan Gu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17793", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please keep the expanding OPT period.

This is a great news for the economic growth for U.S.\n\nDr. David Card, the professor at University of California, Berkeley, Dr, Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz, professor from Columbia University in the City of New York, etc, all did a great amount of research on immigrants' effects on U.S. economic development. I listed the research in the end of my comments. \n\nFirst of all, the STEM field is high-skilled, and large amount of research show that the U.S. DOMESTIC LABOR MARKET is INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY. You can even think of your own experience. How many of your  American classmates or friends are actually studying a STEM program? Computer Science?Research show that the second most popular major for foreign students is engineering.  Among the top 25 universities that maintain the most foreign students, four are Ivy League Universities (Columbia University in the City of New York, Harvard University, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvanian), and 11 are ranking within the top 50 universities according to the U.S. News National Universities Rankings. It can be inferred that most of the foreign students receive high quality education when they are studying in the U.S. Lots of high-educated foreign students can provide enough supply for the labor force market in STEM field.\n\nSecond, research show that FOREIGN STUDENTS CREATE JOBS FOR AMERICANS! The research of  Dr, Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz, who completed his Ph.D in Massachusetts Institute of Technology, When foreign students provide enough labor force support for the companies in the U.S., profitability and rate of return to capital will rise in labor-intensive sectors of that region or economy, inducing capital to move to those sectors. This RAISES THE DEMAND FOR LABOR, WHICH WILL PUSH WAGES UP AND WILL ALSO RAISE THE EMPLOYMENT OF NATIVES.  \n\nThird, foreign students' working status HAS CLEARLY LITTLE EFFECT IN THE WAGES. \nCaglar Ozden, the  lead economist in the World Banks Development Research Group, stated that according to Ottaviano and Peri (2008) study found that immigration caused an average 0.6 PERCENT WAGE INCREASE for U.S. natives during 19902006.\n\nAs a result, this policy will greatly help Americans economic growth. \n\nThe following is the supporting research. \n\nFrancisco L.

To the international students, most of the time, the precious working experience is more important than a green card. Most of the international students in United States are from developing countries, like China and India. In these developing countries, they need these international students with a broader view and latest technologies more than United States. But due to the increase of international student population, most of the high salary jobs in these countries are only opened to internationaI students with enough working experience and the staring salary in these countries is not comparable to developed countries like United States. This is the reason why lots of new graduated international students want to find jobs in United States and stay here until they can get a working visa. However, if they can have a total 3 year working experience in United States, I think most of the international students would love to come back to their home country after this period instead of get a green card and stay here forever and the job openings will not be occupied by international students in a long term. And this will encourage more and more international students to come and study in United States and bring huge profits in this way. These international students need to pay relatively higher tuition fee and other fee for school, this income can increase funding for the US universities and colleges to improve the teaching equipment, support research and increase the faculty salaries. Moreover, international students need to live their own lives beside study. This also a huge expense will promote a lot of service industries. For instance, there are Home-Stay towns in California, from where domestic families providing a home stay for the young age international students and make money in this way. And this could be the main household income for these families.  Also, international student who worked for United States after they graduated with a short term employment will not affect their long term employment to the citizen. As more and more companies can hire short term international student for their short term projects and make profits really quick. These companies dont need to provide Visa sponsorship for international student as they have enough time to work legally to finish a project. In this way, these companies can have more jobs only open to citizens. An extended OPT will change the current situation as the international students are occupying a lot of long-term job openings for citizen. \nIn a word, I support the extension of OPT period for STEM international students as this will bring profits to both sides.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Weiyue Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0703", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. \nThis expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of\npayroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay.

The reason why OPT extension exists is to provide better training program for STEM student who STUDIED in the U.S., and a compensation for the shortage of H-1 working visa. International student are attracted by U.S. universities for their excellent education, with the OPT program, these students can be better trained in the real industry, and longer to the U.S.\n\nSTEM students are not robbing jobs from *ANY* US citizen. It is clearly not true that companies will give jobs to international students BECAUSE they are INTERNATIONAL, or because they are asking for LESS MONEY. On the contrary, companies may even need to spend more money on an international student for their future H-1 working visa. The only reason a company give a job to anyone, no matter international or not, is that they are qualified for the position. Blaming unemployment rate to international students is clearly ASSUMES FACTS but not providing EVIDENCE. \n\nSTEM students improve US competitiveness in the future. Every developed country is or will be suffering from shortage of younger people as work forces. OPT STEM students ARE the younger work forces. Most of them just graduated from colleges and universities in their 20's, and can provide with more than 40 years of contribution. If the US is welcoming to these students, they might became someone very important in the US STEM future. \n\nSTEM students are the one that the US need to keep. The current immigration law does little favor to the highly educated STEM students than the illegal immigrants who barely can get the minimum wages. The STEM students has no communication obstacles, and they work hard to get a decent job. The not hard working or talented students will need to go back to their country if they cannot get any or keep any job within 3 months after graduation.\n\nThe new STEM rule increases the difficulty of getting STEM extension, which ensures that the extension can go to the right people. If you read carefully in this proposed rule, you can see that to get an extension, the STEM student and the employer need to have a training plan. By doing so, the company need to provide an mentor and training program to the qualified student. If a company would like to spend money and time for certain student, the reason must be that they believe in the student and what she/he could contribute in the future. \n\nLet's think about future for the US.

A common thing in such occupations is that it requires a systematic and long-period training. Take myself as an example, I graduated from Rice University this May with a PhD degree in physics. Now I'm working in a oil company analyzing seismic data. The job doesn't require a geology background, but it included the geology related knowledge in its 2-month training, with lots of follow-up training throughout the year. Now, after nearly half an year, I finally feel that I begin to contribute to the company, using all the skills I have learned from my PhD together with the knowledge I just learned in the past 6 month. \nImagine in a situation where an F-1 student can only work for one year after graduation, is the company still willing to investigate that much on an employee? Especially with the odd of H1B approval getting lower and lower, such investigation is more like a gambling instead of reasonable choice.\nAnd the fundamental question is still why STEM students are so important to America and American companies. I don't think I need to put too much words on this topic, since we all know how new technology and new invention drives this country to be the best of the world, and how foreigners contribute to these groundbreaking techniques. In the physics department of Rice, only half of the graduate students are Americans. It might sound like an extreme case, but a growing ratio of foreign students in STEM departments in top schools is definitely happening. And it is not because that American students are replaced by F-1 students, but because, with a decreasing interest in science and technology among American students, F-1 students filled the vacancy. And it's the same thing for the high-tech companies. The benefit is mutual.\n\nYou may think my point of view is somehow affected by my personal interest, and I could not deny that. But the fact is that STEM F-1 students have contributed a lot to America, and most of them have proven their value. I believe we deserve a better, or at least not worse, chance to continue to do so. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by HENG JI", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20281", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM degrees are really important for American economy .

From my past year teaching. I feel it is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out.\n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.-google 1point3acres\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries.

These were not the typical unskilled positions that Americans have chosen for the last 60 years to ignore, taking jobs in restaurants, hotels, and construction.  The trend has moved to highly skilled technical jobs, such as computer programming, accounting, and laboratory technology using outsourcing firms based in India, Philippines, and other areas to fill jobs previously occupied by an American middle class. The layoffs at Disney are not just an anomaly.  Other companies, including power utilities like Southern California Edison and technology giants like Microsoft, Facebook and Google repeatedly press for increases in the annual quotas, saying there are not enough Americans with the skills they need.  \nAccording to federal guidelines, the visas are intended for foreigners with advanced science or computer skills to fill discrete positions when American workers with those skills cannot be found. Their use, the guidelines say, should not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of Americans. Because of legal loopholes, however, in practice, companies do not have to recruit American workers first or guarantee that Americans will not be displaced.

As we know, the OPT program is flexible in terms of employment. Under this proposal, the total 3-year OPT program will give international students enough freedom to work on their ideas, try on their thoughts and build great companies if possible. Clearly we should support a proposal like this which could potentially bring us another great company like Facebook or Google. And it is needless to elaborate the benefits of having more of these companies. \n\nSecond, the OPT extension program is essential to keep the renowned fame of US universities. In the most recent USNEWS ranking, Tsinghua University in China has been ranked first in engineering schools. American people may argue that Tsinghua is not as good as MIT, Stanford, Berkeley especially in terms of internationalization, e.g., the number and quality of international students. They believe the best university must attract students from all over the world. I agree that it is essential for a top university to get best international students. But if this proposal was rejected, the international students will definitely hesitate when picking US universities. Without these top international students, how can we build the best universities in the world?  \n\nLast but probably most important, the OPT extension program is key to ensure the leader position of US software companies. We all know how important software industry is to the US economy. Without the OPT extension program, it would be hard for US universities to attract best international students and therefore, these talented workforce will remain in their home countries. In recent years, we have seen the development of software companies in countries outside US, e.g., Alibaba, Tencent in China, and Flipcart in India. Their success was achieved given that a large fraction of their best workforce are coming to US and work for US companies. If a proposal like this was rejected, I cant imagine how US software companies shall compete internationally if these top students remain in their home countries. \n\nFrom my perspective, it is very clear that we should support this proposal. It will only bring benefits to the American people. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuhuan Du", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22070", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I guess some much FREE stuff is given to  our government politicians and minorities that we won't need jobs much longer.\n\nOnce we go completely socialistic with the politicians ruling as the rich, everyone else with free-bees, we'll have to have more  immigrants to work for us, That is until the stupid once again grants citizenship to them. \n\nJust my look at the stupidity of our politicians.

God will Curse those who curse us and bless those who bless us! the Curse cause more will surely come! here information regarding known working & problem  its caused that these fellows have searched out and discovered. The issue is God! A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\n    OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n    OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n\nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\n    The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n    \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nSee attachment for remainder of this messages info.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Pamela Goforth", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4239", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I believe OPT extension is quite important to US.\n1.

International students have made and are continually making great contribution to the nation in their field of study and in the industry as well. STEM are critical not only for the US,but also for other nations that are seeking quick development in technology, science, engineering and math. For many STEM major students like myself, the main reason whey we choose US is that institutes, universities here have competitive academic capability. Admitting more international students who are smart, with talent in their field will make the programs even strongly. This will bring about positive impact to universities, the nation and everyone who lives here in a long run. \n\n2. There are many different countries students can choose to pursue good education. What makes US extremely outstanding is that it offers the opportunity for excellent students who are employed by E-verify companies and working in their field of study to gain more experience before going back to their own country. It is a win-win thing for both the student and the companies, since it is a good way to bring the talent on board,to make the knowledge into value, to improve economy nationwide and to guarantee diversity.\n\n3. When applying for OPT extension, the student should first get a job from E-verified company, and they must be woking in their field of study, so it is pretty obvious that they are qualified for the job. And as far as I know, STEM students all get paid equally for the equal job. We should all be clear that International students getting less wage during internship than full time employees is not the same thing of companies paying less for them. \n\nI do admit that competition exists.

MIT gave me a really good training and quality education and I am grateful to MIT and the USA for it. If this rule is not passed, I will be deported back to my country. I think this makes no sense, because \n\n1) If US invests so much on providing education and training to foreign students, it should not make it so hard for them to stay here and serve the US economy. \n2) US gains a high positive reputation in the world because of its welcoming nature to people all around the world.

According to this Forbes article (http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/04/25/40-largest-u-s-companies-founded-by-immigrants-or-their-children/), 40% of the largest US companies are founded by immigrants or their children.

Vast majority of graduate students in STEM fields are foreign born. If US sweeps them away, the innovation and research is hugely negatively affected.\n\nTherefore, having well-educated and well-trained foreign students in the USA is critically important. I not only hope this rules passes, but also hope that the revised rule contains more incentives, so that staying here is not so much of a pain in the neck for foreign students.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Pramod Kandel", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9572", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\nI find it appalling that any elected official would have a passing thought based on this concept.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n\n\"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers. The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.\n\nFinally, the Regulations fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regulation, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for fraud leaves the victimized American still goes without proper compensation.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by William Harrison", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3712", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "From my personal perspective, I think extended STEM will attract more talented foreigners to help boom the United States' economy, creating more job opportunities for Americans in the meanwihle.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alfred Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20451", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We have a lot of un and underemployed American citizens that need these jobs.

In this field, most of the research we performed in universities is at least 2~3 years ahead of state-of-the-art technology. So in order to support these researches being implemented into real industry, a 2~3 years (at least) after school practical training will be ideal. This is beneficial for employers and the whole industry, because they can hire the researchers/PhDs who know those innovations the most, and they are indeed the ones that most passionate about those ideas and willing to realize them. On the other hand, only when college grads get fully trained in the industry environment, can they fully understand the complexities and challenges, so that they continue to improve those technologies and lead to wider spread productions and applications. For example, in the high power high voltage electronics field (for electrical vehicle, smaller compact power supplier), right now GaN is the technology that starts to be widely commercialized just since the last 3~4 years, and this is all due to the opportunities/hard work from those PhDs who had their research on this technology in university and devoted themselves to this electronics revolution after graduation (I personally know at least 10 of them, and all started with the 29-month OPT). Without OPT, many of these technologies/inventions will still stay in the laboratory. I believe this is also true for other high-tech fields, so I consider extending OPT to a 3 years length is necessary. \n\n(2) STEM extension is the key for attracting international students to get higher education in U.S.\nOPT STEM extension is probably one of the most important reasons that so many foreign students choose U.S. for receiving higher education. At least for myself, 6 years ago, I chose U.S. mainly because of this opportunity. For most of STEM program, OPT is very valuable part of the whole education to gain more knowledge and experience in the major, which you may not get from many other countries. So I believe this is my right to request this extension after graduation, and this should also be the responsibility for U.S. government to keep this promise at least for the students already enrolled and spend so many years in U.S. universities.\n\n(3) STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident.\nMany have the misunderstanding that OPT students are taking away job \nopportunities that belongs to U.S. residents. That is completely WRONG. OPT/\nSTEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education. The \nOPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted\nto H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local \nresidents. According to 2015 data, only 13% of the 215000 H1B applicants were from STEM OPT. The results of 2015 H1B approval also shows that only less than 15% of the approvals are given to OPT students, the rest are granted to workers that are imported from other countries directly. Revoking STEM OPT will do very little to help. \n\nOn the other hand. U.S. government has imposed many restrictions on STEM OPT\nstudents. For example, the total unemployed time during OPT cannot be \nlonger than 90 days, they can only work for e-verified companies, which is a\nsmall portion of the job market, etc. Burdened by these immigration \npolicies, it is already an unfair job hunting game and they have no way to \nbe as competitive in many aspects as an equally good U.S. resident. If a \nforeign student finally wins a job out from such a competition, that means \nhe/she is outstanding and is the person that this country needs. \n\nFinally, the right way to build a leading country is to bringing in outstanding people, as the government has been doing for so many years.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zeng Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19423", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Our country needs more talents and international students are the most valuable resources of talented people!!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by php programmer", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11809", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Students from STEM are all the top students from foreign countries and they can be really good employees.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. \n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n.\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.. \n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. . \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nMyself is a master of science in statistics graduate from UC Irvine, I certainly feel the need to have 24 months extension in order to contribute.

Many obstacles have been put on skilled foreigners of finding opportunities. Lots of job positions require US citizenship or permanent residence. Most of the rest companies have preference for hiring US citizens over foreigners. Considering the obstacles and difficulties foreigners encounter in finding opportunities, an apparent question to ask ourselves would be: \"why American companies sometimes choose to hire foreigners?\" I would like to believe that American companies are clever enough to hire the most competitive people. With all due respect, American people should be more open and confident as a super power, that they can compete with the foreigners with a huge advantage of citizenship.

They also face discrimination because contrary to the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers' claims, it's harder to find a position with an OPT degree.  The employer is aware that there is a limited duration (1-3 years depending on the type of degree, non STEM only have 1 year) and do not want to hire and train someone only to have them leave a year later.  There are numerous state and military sector jobs that only hire citizens, and many private companies that do not want any workers on a visa or who may need visa sponsorship.

However, employers and the federal government are concerned about not only the quantity but also the quality of their employees. STEM students normally have at least 2-5 years of study experience in the States, so they are able to adapt into the society of America. After 2-5 years of professional training in some of the top 100 universities, most STEM students are capable of doing a good job in his or her professional fields. If the States let them go back to where they come from, the excellent resources of education in these significant fields will just spread and leave no benefit for the US. Think about how the professors delight these students with brilliant intelligence and persistent pursuit of academy, and how the intelligent treasure can transform into efficacy and innovation for the society. Whether the great treasure these students inherent from their respected professors will continue to spark in the States depends on the training opportunity they are given. The federal government cares not only the wages of employees but also the development of the States.\n   \n    Additionally, as a choice for studying abroad, US has long been famed with liberty and chances. From the world wars in the 1900s, America has provided great platforms for genius in all fields to concentrate on their profession and produce masterpieces for the entire human. That's why we long for an opportunity to study in the US. As time goes by, America has become a society of multi families, and that is part of the reasons for the exuberance of the American society. Learning from the experience of the US, countries in other parts of the world such as Europe and Australia have also opened their gate to international students. Some European countries like Germany even do not let international students pay tuition fees. Undoubtedly, America has prominent advantages in terms of employment policies which opposes discrimination. If the federal government provide better environment for students to pursue their dreams, they are certainly willing to study in the US. As far as I know, the tuition fee for international students is quite a considerable number. Whether students will find a job or not, their tuition fee has already been sent to the University. With a more positive prospective in job application, more students will be motivated to study in the US.\n\n    Last but not least, students from all around the world cherish the opportunity to study in the States and make their contributions for this land of liberty.

If this rule is failed, I won't be able to work here legally anymore and have to leave the country also. \n\nIf the rule can't pass, there're 3 aspects will be influenced badly. 1) I will have to leave the country and pay for the debts by myself without a job.

The failure of the rule will lead at least thousand of people into a lifetime trouble. 2) The company I work for will lose money too. I work closely with my teammates and make contribution to our company. I'm in charge of 3 critical projects in our team and the absence of me will leave the rest of my teammates a very big problem. They have to recruit new people and give the new guy half year to learn what I've done which is a large delay for the team's project. If the product can't be delivered on time, the company will lose profit, then the salary of employees will also be influenced. There're lots of people in my company holding OPT now, this isn't e exaggerating. 3) The US government will lose the ability to attract talented young people to this country and lose the technology force. It's undeniable that tech-companies make a great contribution to the US economy, while most of the tech-companies' employees are or were using OPT-extensions before. If the opt extension rule fails, the companies' performance will be largely impacted.\n\nThere're also 3 benefits that the new rule can lead to: 1) The talented and hardworking employees can stay their positions and work for their employers. This means a lot of families will be saved and they don't have to leave the country with unfulfilled American dream.  2) More and more people can use the extension period to apply for H1b and continue to work for US society. These people will stay in the city, pay the tax, buy kinds of goods, help the community and improve the eco of US. 3) The OPT-Extension will keep US attracting more and more talented and smart people to come here and study. If one people pay so much to study here and can't have enough time to practice his or her skills, than the education in US will become less attractive and these young people will move to the other rising countries like UK or Euro.

Shortening this time would make US universities much less appealing to foreign students.  That will cause fewer talents to study in US. We all know diversity is a big reason makes this country great.

I am presently working on OPT in a reputed firm and have been gaining the much needed practical experience which would be very useful when I return to my home country.\n\nWithout STEM extension, I personally believe from my experience that 12 months' OPT time would not be enough to find job, get practical exposure from working. Without the necessary practical exposure, no student can make best use of his education. Most of the companies will be looking for longer commitment from the candidate, no company will be interested in candidates that are bound to leave in near future. Practical training is what attracts lot of students across the globe to USA. It would be a loss for the students to invest so much money just to get a degree on the paper and no practical training.\n\nImpact of STEM revocation.\n\n1)      As many as 50000 highly qualified and skilled students will be sent out of this country early next year. A sudden and huge loss to the industry and universities. It might take several months, or years to fill these positions, thus companies' loose lot of money.\n\n2)      After the first wave of 50k students leaving USA, the next wave comes in mid of 2016, when most of the students who graduated mid of last year will have their 12 months OPT expired. This second wave will take out a significant proportions of STEM grads from the country.\n\n3)      The third and supposedly final wave of students leaving USA will take place towards, the end of next year when students who graduated in December last year will have their OPT expired.\n\n4)      With more than 200,000 students leaving USA in just one year, and a drastic reduction in influx of international students, it will be imminent that USA will incur heavy losses and a complete depletion of STEM grads.\n\n5)        Many of the universities and programs will have to be shutdown to minimize the operating costs.\n\n6)      Research programs in industry and universities will be shutdown abruptly.\n\n7)      Decline in the diversity of demographics, professional fields\n\n8)      After the damage is done, it might take several more years to regain the state that we are in today.\n\n I cannot stress enough how urgently we need this proposal.

Having so many corporations need to fill those spots again would probably open up the job market a little bit, but the cost of hiring and training doesn't seem worth it. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by David Ware", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2541", "postedDate": "2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STOP OPT Now!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Andrew Langwiser, Andy's Books", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3965", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree with the move. international student should contribute to US economy .", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lokeshkumar Patel", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7246", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "To Whom It May Concern, \n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program \nand so should you.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nThe following are my thoughts in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nI have been an international student in the United States since 2012. I am pursuing  a STEM degree and  will graduate in Dec 2015 with a Masters degree in the field of Mechanical engineering. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my future employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for re-instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and most importantly the increased extension period.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nOPT STEM Extension is one of the major reasons why students like me choose to relocate to the United States for our advanced degrees. I do my research in the area of Metal matrix Nano-composites, there are only a handful of institutions worldwide which work in this field, most of them are located in the United States. So, starting December, I need to be able to find a position in one of these places (which being an international student will be difficult), then start working within 3 months. Which will only give me 9 months at best. I don't think 9 months is enough for me to first learn and then make any meaningful contribution to the field. If I leave the US then, it will make the last 3 years of my life nothing more than a huge waste of my time and money. So, the proposal to re-institute a more comprehensive STEM extension is extremely important to me. It will give me more time to integrate the knowledge and skills I gained in the classroom over the last two years. Without proper training in a professional training STEM graduates like me are bound to struggle. It will further enhance the US' reputation as a global leader for higher education as more and more people will be inclined to join STEM programs in the US.\n\n\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nMy goal is to make a significant contribution to my field of knowledge. In order to be a make this contribution, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period I think is the appropriate duration. \n\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThere may be some merit in the opposing argument about the native born Americans losing jobs. But, I don't think it is a fair argument. Someone like me, someone who is extremely motivated to be successful is bound to create jobs.The United States has presented me with unimaginable research opportunities that I could only dream of few year ago, I want to return the favor. I don't want someone to suffer because they think I took their job, I don't get any preferential treatment when applying for jobs in mechanical engineering industries, In fact it is the other-way around, for an international student to be hired in a mechanical engineering position he needs to be extremely competent. There's no free lunch, they only hire us, when they feel all the trouble of hiring an international student is worth it.\n\nChanging temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nPavan Pasumarthi", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Pavan Pasumarthi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18956", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons: \n\nMost of international students come to pursue their degrees in United States because they attach importance to this OPT extension, which makes them gain valuable experience here and make contributions to the companies they work for. \n\nIf government cancel the extension, the number of international students who come to USA would decrease sharply!!!

In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment.This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022.\n\nIn summary, working opportunities are very important for international students.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff (cont.):\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\n\nMany more could be added but the length of this form would be exceeded.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jim Delton", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3925", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a good rule and would end up benefitting the American economy because of the presence of the skilled workers ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rohit Jain", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9632", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.\n\nI am unable to find anything in this proposed rule which would be beneficial to American workers or students.

Just a few of the known issues are:\n\n   1. The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\n    2. There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\n    3. OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThis is in addition to the grossly unfair tax advantages enjoyed by firms hiring foreign workers and not paying FICA and Medicare taxes.  Yet, as DHS is aware, these workers will ultimately cost the US taxpayer billions in benefits.\n\nWhy DHS even considers such social-engineering as this is a mystery.  To enact these rules are utterly criminal and an affront to reason.

This action, which is even better than the current 17 month rule, will benefits not only the students themselves but also domestic labors and therefore will make a big difference to the growth of US economics. I highly support this action because of the following reasons:\n\n1. We should protect these people who are making a huge contribution to the US rather than forcing them out. In 2011, Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world and produced more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. Most international students work in scientific and technology fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. \n\n2. It is not competition, it is producing more jobs! The so-called competition is short-sighted and not true. We need international students stays and work for us because domestic labors are far from enough. We definitely would like to hire domestic people as long as they are qualified for the job, unfortunately some times it is really hard to find a qualified US citizen for some specific positions. International labors then became the only choice. Just imagine what gonna happen if we lose these great people? Most of the High-tech companies cannot run at all! There will be a lot of domestic labors lose theirs jobs if we lose international labors because companies will slow down and even stop. \n\n3. Should we train them, make them grow and let them go back to serve their countries after one year? Most of people get skilled after hired for one year or two. We should definitely have them serve us for longer rather than forcing them back to home! We should take full advantage of our resources rather than wasting our time and money on short-term forces. Give them more time and let them serve for our country! More tax, more jobs and greater GDP\n\nThere is no reason for any of us to opposite this 24 month STEM OPT action.

American requires the everyone to work hard to maintain the healthy running of this big country machine, meanwhile, the good-skilled workers are the ones triggering them to be the hard-working one instead of staying at the home and getting the free money from the government.\n(3) Foreign students come here to learn knowledge and go back to their country to be the competitive employees. One-year experience is not enough for them to be trained. In order to get the experience, a lot of international students get lower payment than native speakers, which should blame the employers to steal the job from American instead of us.

In addition, the ability to apply for a STEM extension more than once will also be well received by our students. \n\nI do have a few critiques that I will list below:\n\n- There has been a lot of concern from current OPT students regarding the timing of this ruling and the timing of their application for STEM OPT extension. At this point, we have been advising students to wait until the last moment possible in hopes the new rule is effective by the time they need to apply to avoid double applications. I worry that there will be a lot of confusion during this transition period among what is required to extend for those currently on the 17 month extension as well as what students with pending STEM OPT applications need to do to meet the standards of the new rule. A timely roll out of the new rule would be much appreciated!\n\n- The new ruling states that students will be able to apply for STEM extension based on a previous STEM degree. While I see the benefit to this, I don't see the practical nature of this as the student's 12 month OPT will still need to relate to their most recent degree. So for example, if a student has an engineering BA but them goes for an MBA, their 12 month OPT will need to relate to the MBA so when they go for an extension it would mean leaving a company they have only been with for 1 year. If you do end up going this route, I would suggest allowing the same flexibility to OPT, so the 12 month OPT could relate to any earned degree (from a US accredited institution).\n\n- I also have a lot of hesitation regarding the mentor/training plan. Most of the students we see who apply for the STEM extension have already had up to a minimum of 2 years of full time work experience if you include CPT and the 12 months of OPT. While I see the benefit of this type of plan, I see it fitting more in line with CPT authorization. Requiring it at the STEM extension application period could be very awkward for some of our students who may have already reached a senior position in their field. In addition to the poor timing of requiring a mentoring plan, I also feel this type of requirement puts a lot of unnecessary reporting on the plates of the employers which may increase the lack of interest among U.S. employers to hire international students. Again, while I see the benefit to this type of mentoring plan I think it would be MUCH more fitting to CPT authorization where that practical training is truly a part of their educational experience. \n\n- If you do end up going with the training plan, I don't think it is necessary to include the information about compensation. That seems very intrusive on the part of the DSO to require this information.\n\nAgain, I truly appreciate all the work that DHS is putting into this ruling! I look forward to seeing the end result. \n\nThank you,\nSarah\n\nSarah Churchill\nInternational Student Services\nUniversity of St. Thomas\nSt. Paul, MN 55105\n651-962-6650", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sarah Churchill, University of St. Thomas", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9288", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Totally agree on this rule!

They generate USA, and USA also generates them. This is why USA can continue attracting a lot of students from world and remains strong. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of international graduate student who cannot get H1B visa on their first attempt because of the limit number of H1B visa. These people have been trained at at top universities and have at least one year of experience in companies but they will have to go back to their homeland which could have very sparse opportunities and try using what they learned in USA which is really an enormous loss for the individual and USA. If USA can give these people OPT extension, they will have more chances to stay and contribute to the development of USA. So, improving and expanding OPT will lead to a win-win situation.

As we all know, big data period is the next upcoming period which demands huge amount of people with expertise in statistics and engineering. As far as I know, students who are US citizens and major in STEM are far less than the amount demanded by the society. International students with expertise in STEM could satisfy the demand of the society and US doesn't want to miss the big data challenge.\n     2) Shortening OPT STEM extension doesn't necessarily reduce the amount of immigrants, on the other hand, it could potentially increase the number of people who reside in US illegally.  Some international students who couldn't get H1B visa within the two years will try to stay illegally in US and their skills couldn't be utilized as it should be. what a loss!\n     3) Extension of STEM could attract more valuable and skilled international students.

I believe it should be extended to 24 months. The extension would be beneficial to all that are involved, which are; the students, U.S. employers, the economic sector, and the educational system. If this proposed extension becomes successful, STEM students would gain more experience during their OPT period due to the additional time. STEM students are limited to a time period of seventeen months to achieve both theoretical and practical knowledge in their specified fields. Time extension would be beneficial to the students in that they will be knowledgeably equipped to practice in their home countries. Also, this would give them more time to spend with their families, and the numerous friends they have made over the years. \nFurthermore, the extension would also be beneficial to the U.S. employers. This is because, majority of international students that come to the U.S. to study are in the STEM fields. STEM students tend to provide valuable skills to employers. In an educational research article by Neil Ruiz, he pointed out that \"collectively the STEM fields accounted for 37 percent of all F-1 visa approvals, compared to 27 percent overall\". \nhttp://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/geography-of-foreign-students#/M10420 . Employers benefit a lot from the skills of STEM OPT students. Some opposing arguments suggest that giving STEM OPT students more time to work in the U.S. will displace American workers. This argument can be countered because it is illegal for an employer to terminate or layoff any eligible U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to an F-1 student. \nAlso, STEM students contribute to the United States economy by providing assistance to scientific research professionals. They use their skills to develop new technologies which are used in different institutions in the country, and they also help to improve existing technologies. All these are beneficial to the U.S. economy. Allowing them more time to explore in their different fields would give them more time to give back to the country that has impacted so much knowledge in them. \nIn addition, this will also benefit the U.S. educational system by attracting more international students to the STEM field. People back home would feel more encouraged to come study in the U.S. because they believe they would be given quality opportunity to learn and explore. This in turn would benefit the U.S. educational system by pumping more money into the system. I was an international student, and I know how much I spent out of pocket in the course of my undergraduate education. My family back home was willing to invest all that money in me because they wanted me to get the best education. International students pay all their tuition out of pocket. An international student's tuition for just a semester would cover a U.S. citizen's tuition for at least two years in college. International students contribute hugely to the educational system, not just by bringing in their diverse cultures to spice up things for the American students, but also they financially assist in the continuous growth of the school system. Hence, if their needs are not met, that would be so discouraging to the ones back home who have the intention of coming to America to study. \nIn an article by NAFSA, it was noted that \"886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during 2013-2014 academic year\". \nhttp://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/. Extending the STEM OPT to 24 months would benefit the students and the United States economy/ educational system. So I believe it would be a win-win situation for everyone if this proposal becomes successful.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Irene Anyanwu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3144", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Someone, please tell me why the Obama administration is more interested in rewarding foreign workers than helping highly educated American Citizens find jobs with hi tech companies.\n\nEmployers wanting to hire foreign workers should be taxed 20% \"foreign worker tax\" and the employee should also be taxed 20% for the honor of being permitted to work in the United States at the expense of American Citizens, American Workers, and American Taxpayers.\n\nStop the madness.

Also, universities earn a good portion of their money through international student fees which is at least 4 times an instate student fees. Therefore, the 24 month rule will aid in attracting students to join universities in America. In the absence of the rule, students will no longer want to study abroad, thereby reducing the money earned by universities, which then reduces the amount universities can spend on research which again reduces the development of the country.

This definitely is a win-win strategy for United States as well as international students. I am working as a data analyst and our team needs to find people with strong quantitative background, programming skills and great sense of responsibility. Most of the resumes we get are from International students. Without the OPT Extension program, it will be very hard for us to find new team members. It usually takes several months to get a new employee fully on board. One year OPT is not long enough for them to make fully use of their knowledge and working on the projects. Our team built statistical models for our clients, which needs to be updated and maintained biweekly. We also need to rebuild models for our clients every half a year to keep the model effective. With the OPT Extension, there will be less transferring of responsibilities and we can work more efficiently. \n\n         I am really shocked to find so many negative comments who object the rule. STEM students will not drive US citizens in all industries out of job market. The proposed rule only allows international students who got their STEM degree in US to work. It is illegal for them to work in other industries which do not require a STEM degree. Yes, sometimes it can be hard to find a job. But, please be aware, it is also really hard to find the suitable people to fill openings. All companies have a preference towards US citizens if they have the same skill set and capability. It is because citizens can work without any restrictions but international students need sponsorship. \n\n         So, let's face the reality. STEM students are not taking jobs from US citizens. However, if you do not have the right skills that companies are looking for, it will be hard for you to find a job, no matter whether you have a citizenship or not.

It would help US continuously have a very good number of high quality international employees, who have been significantly contributing on the growth of economy (especially on high tech branch) in the States since years ago. Otherwise, the Companies would lose thousands of international employees next year, which would be a tremendous disaster for their operation and growth, especially for small business. Since there may not be enough qualified domestic candidates to hire in such a short time, as a result, not having this OPT extension may put the whole economy system in danger here in the States.\n\n2. United States of America, as we all know, is one of the most developed and most civilized countries in the world; not only because of  the right path those national fathers created a couple hundreds years ago, but also the spirits and values of this country: Freedom, Justice and Diversity that built gradually generation by generation, which exactly is also what their citizens are proud of. When I first came to the States, the director of the international office in my school, told me something like this: \"This country is strong as a thick rope, because she has been joined and being reinforced by high quality small ropes from different corners of the world. Therefore, we believe that the States will be as strong as they are with many high quality international components in the future\".\n\n3. More working experiences for international students can be beneficial for both side: the students would get trained more and learn more skill before they head back their own country, which makes them more competitive to better contribute what they could and pursue what they are eager to for their life. On the other hand,  when they are back home, their \"USA\" working experiences can enhance business tie with USA when there is any business going on.\n\n4. With OPT extension, some extraordinary international students may also be able to put what they have designed or developed into the market, create a startup, which may bring potential jobs in the near future.\n\n5. Some folks might think that this extension would hurt Americans because they think it is a huge disadvantage for them to find a good job. Well that's probably just an illusion, I have been working in software development company for a while, those American who have true skills have no problem to find them a very good job, and it is so much easier for them to find one when comparing to international student. For those folks who are not studying hard or equipped the certain skill, even though all international employees are gone, they still can't get a job from Google, MicroSoft, Apple... Because they are not qualified so the companies won't spend big money on low productivity. Eventually, those company will end up with outsourcing their projects since they do not have enough engineers and scientists locally. But this is definitely going to be an inefficient way and may lower down tech companies' productivity here at USA.\n\n\nFor people like me,\n\nMy wife is currently an information architect at one of IT companies here in the States. Myself is a software engineer, just got my full time job offer and will start my work soon here. Without OPT extension, I only have one chance to try to win \"H1B lottery\"; if I am not getting it, I will lose my job after 12 months OPT. As a results, the whole burden will be put on my wife's shoulder to support the whole family, which will be extremely hard for her. Of course we can leave USA and head back home in this case. But the decision couldn't not be made only by myself, and it is gonna be too hard for both of us. \nTherefore, this OPT extension will be so important for us because I may have 3 chances to get a H1B Visa. Also, a lot of things could be figured out with 24 more months.\n\nIn conclusion, this OPT extension, will be beneficial for me, for people like me, but more importantly, for the whole country in both short and long run.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vincent LI, Rice University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13304", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this move of DHS.

Further, because employers pay no FICA or Medicare taxes to OPT employees, cash strapped Social security and Medicare programs lost 4 billion in desperately needed revenue over the same period.\n\nThe Homeland Security proposal to extent the time available to certain OPT students will triple the number of jobs removed from the market for US Citizens and will likewise triple the loss of funding for Social Security and Medicare.\n\nEven worse, in the long term, is the US \"brain drain\" that results when STEM training and employment opportunities are awarded to foreign students instead of US Citizens. The OPT students will return to their respective countries with high level skills. US Citizens, because their training opportunities were displaced by foreign students, will not be available for jobs requiring STEM skill sets and the cycle of subsidies for foreign OPT employees will perpetuate itself.\n\nNo doubt, some employers consider this a desired feature of the program because of the lower employee costs.  In terms of long term support for a robust national economy and developing the skill sets required to keep the United States at the leading edge of technological advancement, the OPT program is a poor model indeed.\n\nFinally, whatever justification Homeland Security has for making this destructive proposal is entirely opaque.  Why is Homeland Security involved in proposals that involve exclusively economic impacts and that have little relevance to protecting the American people?  Making the US economy strong is one of the most rational security measures we can take as a nation.

I understand why many American people hate this rule, but let's be fair - this is not a battle or competition between international students and US citizens. I do hope when people leave comments here, calm down and read your mind, are you unemployed? Are you unemployed because your dream position is taken by STEM major international students? If that is the case, ask them how hard they have worked to get the position, since they are the minority in this country and they have already experienced too much unfair treatment.\n\nBig IT companies, like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft, don't they want to hire US citizens? of course they do! Hiring a US Citizen saves them a lot of money and effort. They don't necessarily need to spend money and effort to get a H1B visa or even a green card for him. They won't worry about his immigration status because if an international student doesn't get an H1B visa after OPT expires, he has to leave. Then, answer me, OPT extension opponents, are those companies stupid? They are always looking for the biggest profit for themselves in any aspect! If part of their business doesn't work well, they can close the department and lay off everyone there immediately. Then why do they hire international students?\n\nAnother important thing I have to mention here. It is never the case that international students compete with US citizens by asking for the minimum wage. They are not the group of people who are working in McDonald's and Pizza Hut. There is no way for them to get a job by asking for a lower salary. If you have ever interviewed with one of the companies, you should know the process. They are always looking for qualifications of employees' skills first. Big companies won't mind giving thousands of dollars more, but they want to hire the people who can do the thing. If you can't do what they need you to do, why would they hire you? If you don't know how to program at all and look for a software engineering position, is Google insane to get you on-board? There is no difference between an international student, or a US citizen. What matters here, is *SKILL*.\n\nLet's be fair. As a US Citizen, you have huge advantages against international students. Your communication skills are far better than them; You are easily to get promoted once you get a job; You have much more freedom to change a job; You can work in your home country and you can get union with your family very easily. More importantly, US's education system, compared with Chinese, Korean, Indian, Latino countries' education system, give US citizens a lot of options of what they want to do in the future. Most of the international students just start learning STEM majors after getting into college, but US students can start their career even in middle school. I have met a 12-year-old American boy who knows programming pretty well. Therefore, I don't understand why, as a US citizen who successfully finished college or graduate school, is not competent against an international student. So ask yourself, what have you done in the past a few years?\n\nPeople say that OPT extension is helping international student to fight against US citizens. Is that true? What if international students are not allowed to work in this country? Isn't it a disaster? Companies won't be able to get sufficient amount of skillful enough employees, thus they can't keep their pace of creating new technologies. They will lose money, the whole US STEM industries will lose money. Is it actually helping the country? What a joke it is when you say \"Let's help our country's employment by not accepting talented people from other countries?\" Instead, you should say \"Let's have less parties in college and study more!\"\n\nOne last thing to say. If I worked for the US government, I would like to keep the skillful international students here in the US by granting them benefit, rather than expelling them away and letting them contribute their countries which may become threats to the US. You don't welcome them, because you never think about this country, but only yourself, and you have no idea what is the biggest challenge in US's immigration system, which is illegal immigrants. The people who take the majority of jobs have never been, are not and will not be STEM major students.\n\nI hope people to open their eyes and view this proposal rationally rather than emotionally, then you may understand why US government and DHS would like to give extensions to STEM majors.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Feiran Wang, Carnegie Mellon University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13368", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be! valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" This is a very important quote from Sen.

This will give students and employers multiple attempts at H1b and if not, sufficient time to try other NIV options or green card. I have a PhD degree in Physics from one of the top 20 schools in US and I work for an American firm with more than 10,000 employees. Currently I am responsible for a project that brings in more than 15 million dollars per year. I was not selected in the H1B lottery twice. Thanks to the 17 month OPT extension rule, I was able to continue with my job. In the absence of this rule, my group would have failed to keep the international contracts resulting in business loss to the company.\n\nI believe most of the commentators here have confused H1B workers with STEM qualified individuals. First of all, this rule only gives a work authorization. Not a job. To get a job, F1 students compete fair and square. Secondly, an American citizen is ALWAYS given preference. A vast majority of jobs will only hire American citizens in the STEM field and are not open to F1 students at all. If a company is bypassing these laws and trading American workforce over cheap labor, especially in the IT job market, the company should be penalized, not the student. The students did not break any law. Many students graduating from top universities from their respective countries choose American Universities over European Universities just because of the OPT program. If this rule is not passed, it will be a grave injustice to those who had chosen American universities over other international universities.\n\nFinally, the unemployment rate is at an all time low at  5%.

In the past few decades, those people have made great contribution to the US and helped keep it the leading country in many fields such as economy, science and education. To maintain the competence of the US in the world, the government should keep or even improve this policy such that it is still a preferred place for those people with special skills to work in. As a foreign STEM student, I'm kind of disappointed with those who blame us for the jobless rate. Since the jobless rate is related to many factors and the bad economy plays an important role. The world is experiencing a decline of economy growth, it happens in almost every country including those in Europe and Asia. In order to eliminate this decline as soon as possible, the US still needs foreign skilled persons along with many talented US citizens to create more value. Another reason for the US to attract more foreign STEM workers is basically the lack of them. So it is not valid to say that foreign workers take away job opportunities of native-born Americans. It is not fair to refer us as \"cheap workers\" because the salary is based on the work itself. Nobody would do work only to get less paid than others. Besides, I don't think this policy would bring disparity between job opportunities of US citizen and foreigners. There are many restrictions imposed on us such as the length of OPT, chance of getting H1B visa and so on, which already make foreign workers inferior when hunting for jobs. We don't have those privileges citizens do have, so it is not true that we are threatening the chance of native job seekers. \nAgain, the prosperity of the US could not be maintained without the contribution of foreign talented people. We hope the US still remain its liberty, equality and justice, and be open and attractive as it always is.

This proposition ensures that international students in STEM fields can gain much more industry experience than what they can gain from other countries.  The current 17-month OPT-extension rule is one of major reasons why I pursue my master's degree at U.S.. Without such kind of extension rule in STEM fields, it will make U.S. much less competitive over other foreign countries, like U.K., Canada. Actually, those foreign countries are also working on favoring more international students by providing more attractful post-graduate opportunities. For example, in 2008, Canada modified the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP [1]) to allow students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. The modification doubled the number of international students enrolled in the program from 2008 to 2014.\n\n2. For foreign employees who are in OPT or OPT-extension status, currently, what will happen if this proposition gets declined? They will either return to their own countries, or get relocated to other countries with better policies towards foreign employees. The U.S. industry in STEM fields will suffer from losing high-tech talents and on the other hand, other counties will benefit from that. Especially, for large companies, like Google, Facebook, Uber, which are pursuing international growth across the world, they rely on skills acquired by the STEM OPT students and their knowledge of markets in their own countries. \n\n3. Lots commenters mentioned the proposition will threat the employment environment of native Americans, which actually is not the case. First of all, it equal competition (covered by E-verify program). Secondly, International students regularly contribute a huge amount of money to the economy of U.S. and provide lots of job opportunities. According to statistics from NAFSA[2], \"The 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year\". \n\nThanks for all the effort being put to make the propostion happen.\n\n[1] http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/study/work-postgrad.asp\n[2] http://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fada Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22360", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule.\n\nAmerica is a country of immigrants.

Indeed all this program intends to do is to provide an EQUAL opportunity for international students just as Americans have, it's not one over the other.\n\n2. People say companies will hire cheap foreign labors. Wrong! Companies want to hire talented and skilled people for the job, nationality is not a matter. People working with OPT are just paid the same as domestic workers (come on, think about it, eventually they will apply for H1-B visa, which requires them to be paid above prevailing wage). They are also paying a fair amount of income taxes, and they are helping develop the US economy, bringing values to the America. It's a win-win for Americans and foreign people.\n\n3.

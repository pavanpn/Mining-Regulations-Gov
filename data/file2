Only the best ones can get hired. There is no way that foreign workers replace any US citizens. The foreign STEM workers are not cheaper. Instead, the  cost to hire a foreign worker is higher. The salaries are similar. In the meantime, the companies need to pay the cost to prepare paper works like OPT or H1B.They also take the risk that foreign workers have to leave due to visa problems right after the companies train the foreign workers. We all know that employees are more productive when they have two or three years experience.  After all these costs, there are still a few companies hire foreign workers, most of which are high-tech companies. That's because the companies need us. If there is no extension of OPT program, only one year is not enough to train a STEM worker well. The companies will find other ways to fill the blank. Maybe move overseas where they can legally hire foreign STEM workers. At that time, the US economy will hurt, just like the automobile industry.

It is used to bring (or keep) foreign students here for far less money.  American students (of any race) would enter science and engineering at about $60-80K per year.  Good workers, after 5 years, would earn $130K or more.  That is what an engineer or staff scientist would make, more with more experience. \n\nForeign workers are being brought here, or F-1 VISA holders allowed to take jobs, for $40-60K per year, even less.  Some of these people live 6-10 per rented house, because they cannot afford rent in the Bay Area.  Then, when they get permanent residency, they ask for American salaries and are laid-off.  If they complain about the pay, the company holds the F-1 VISA over their heads.  Think I'm making it up, sit outside ANY building of Cisco Systems and see who goes through the door.  More than 80% of them are Indian (NOT American Indian.)  And at least 50% of them will take the bus.  Don't ask the company for diversity info (they classify Indians as Caucasians, which they are), just sit outside at starting time.\n\nIf we are going to make America Great Again, we have to employ Americans first.  If a company wants to employ Indians, or Red Chinese or Russians, open a office there.  But don't flood the land with immigrants for the sake of low wages.  And then these people wind up on the unemployment rolls or in lower paying jobs when they get residency because they won't work for a bag a rice.\n\nAnd if you think I'm just some idiot speaking plainly (as Lee Iaccoca suggested) I have worked in tech and semiconductors for 33 years, have over 10 patents (that I know of) have started companies, have seen two IPOs, and helped design the Atari 5200 Super System.

Studying for a graduate degree from Columbia University, Meyyappan is closer than ever to achieving his goal. In the past year and a half, hes studied how solar power works as well as the policy and business of the industry. After he graduates in December, Meyyappan plans to work at a U.S. solar panel company for a couple of years. India is five years behind the U.S. in solar technology, he said. I want to work in a solar company here and apply the the experience Ive gained back home. The chance to get that work experience was the whole point of coming here. he said. His plans are now at risk because the STEM extension is now in jeopardy. \n\nThe Federal Courts decision to vacate STEM OPT Extension Rule on August 12, 2015 is leaving students like Meyyappan feeling betrayed. When we came in, we made a calculation about how much its going to cost us, and how much were going to earn, he said. I could have gone to London, I could have gone to Australia, but I chose the U.S.\n\nSome students whove gone home after being unable to secure a work visa say they were disappointed that they werent allowed to stay. Masher Dillon, who graduated with an undergraduate degree from UC-Berkeley last year, is now working a marketing job back home in India.\n\nHe was the first of his friends and immediate family to go to college in the U.S., and going to Berkeley was his first time being in the country. A lot of people back home think that working in the United States is like, oh shit, youre arrived, he said. If you work there, regardless of what you do, you could be an Uber driver and it still seems so prestigious.\n\nHe worked in the Bay Area after graduating, but once he ran out of OPT and didnt win the H-1B lottery, he went home. Dhillon doesnt mind working and living at home, and hes saving money, but he says if he was applying for college today, he wouldnt choose an American university. You American students take your job opportunities for granted, he said. I tell my friends, appreciate it for all its worth.\n\nAlso, U.S. companies especially tech firms say they need the talents of international students. Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language-learning app Duelingo and a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, said the limits on hiring international students were frustrating for employers like him.\n\nYou hire a person, who is extremely well educated, and you get them to come work for you, and you have a 70% chance that theyre not going to be able to stay, von Ahn said, Its terrible, because even if you hire super smart people, it takes a couple months to train them. They dont start becoming very useful to the company until about six months  and then they have to leave.\n\nIf the STEM extension isnt reinstated, he said, were probably going to lose two employees who are really hard to hire, a big problem for a small company like Duelingo with only 50 employees. All these extremely well-educated people are probably going to go to some other country and make that country better.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhou Liu, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0072", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please do NOT expand this program.

Will all the tech companies begin to hire those unqualified people for a software engineer position and all the people complaining about this will be able to find a job? \n\nMost STEM OPT holders went to college in US, they paid much more tuition in US, they work harder in to overcome language and culture disadvantage and to gain a degree. After graduating, they need to compete with a lot of native people to get a job. And when they start working, they have to pay the same amount of tax while enjoying much less benefit compared to native americans. Baring such fact, they still are still working hard because they believe one day their american dream can come true because of all the hard work they have done. They make great contribution to the US society.\n\nNow what? Just because the economy is not as good, a small group of people are blaming the opt extension program for their unemployment, and that is absurd. Event if those tens of thousands of STEM OPT holder are forced to leave US, are those unemployed people be able to take up what they have left? Definitely NO. Upon my observation, as long as people are equipped with proper skills, they can find a good job in tech industry.\n\nThose who are complaining about the stem program are just jealous of honest and hardworking people who are making their life better  through their own hard work. They want to destroy others hope and make others as poor as they are. That is very EVIL.\n\nTerminating this STEM OPT extension program will do good to NO ONE. \n\nFor OPT holders, the belief that people can make a better life through hardworking is destroyed.\nFor government, for decades, the idea of people cam realize their american dream on their own hand, which they are trying to convey to the whole society and appeal more elites around will become a LIE. They will lose their honesty to the whole world.\nFor employers, they will lose a lot of skilled engineers and even they are willing to pay more, they are very unlikely to find equally replacement of what they have lost.\nFor those unemployed people, they will still won't able to find a decent job as long as they don't learn some skills and keep being jealous about others.'\n\nWho knows what will be their next target? Maybe some people just want the whole society to go through the same miserable life which is a result of their own incapability and laziness.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fan Gao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12568", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Totally agree!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jue Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1124", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reason.

From history, it is bringing talented people to this country that let this country become what it is today. Imagine what would this country be without those talented foreigners coming here?\n\nSecond, the more time international students work in the U.S., the more benefits it can bring to this country. For example, highly educated international students can apply their expertise to help companies' business, hence to help increase the U.S. government's taxes income and the country's economy.\n\nOn the other hand, this rule does not hurt Americans.\n\nFirst, there are much less American college students studying STEM. Sometimes, it is much less likely to find an American student with specific tech skills to do a specific job than to find an international student to do that.\n\nSecond, international students studying STEM help this country's economy. Those getting stipend from school are most Ph.D. students. They pay income taxes to the government. Those Master students coming to study STEM are supported by themselves, and they pay tuition, in hence help this country's economy.\n\nThird, international students are not cheap labor. When they are hired, their wage must be greater than or equal to the prevailing wage in that city and area. So, it is not because international students are cheaper to hire than American students, but sometimes they have specific skills that companies are looking for. Without those skilled international students, tech companies will lose a great power to grow and in hence less profit to make, and the country's economy will be damaged.\n\nFrom all above, this proposed rule not only will not hurt this country, but it will help make this country great.\n\nThank you for your time reading my comments.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16700", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I find it abominable that the government would even consider expanding the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, giving employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program.

First, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. And OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. Second, US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. Third, for my situation, the rental fees are a part of incomes to the US citizen who has an unused house. \n\nIn Conclusion, the duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields.

What I want to do here, is merely provide some personal thoughts about this regulation and other reviews. \nThere apparently are two sharply opposite opinions about how high skill immigrants will affect the U.S. Some people, mostly U.S. citizen, think the immigrants are enlarging the pool of candidates for one job, therefore naturally lower the bargain power from the worker side. I partially agree with this argument. However, human resource is somewhat international now. A better way to keep oneself competitive is to get more skillful, not to drive other people out. \nOn the other hand, some reviewers, mostly international students to whom this OPT extension policy may apply, support this policy by several arguments. A common one is that the U.S. has always been a country that welcomes immigrants, and in history, immigrants made the U.S. what it is today. \nI don't think appealing to the tradition of welcoming immigrants is a good way to justify the OPT extension policy. Time has changed. After 200 years of development, the U.S. now has its own people and their interest at heart. If the immigration policy is harming the U.S. as a nation today, I think the country has every right to change the policy and guard its people's right and benefit. But for me, it seems very difficult to correctly assess the effect of a huge policy, such as immigration. If I were an ordinary U.S. citizen, I would trust my country to make the right decision on that. \nSimilarly, an argument saying that immigrants created a lot of job and enhanced the U.S. economy seems also shaky. I don't really believe that a foreigner can know better on these topics than the U.S. government who has all the data. So, if the president and his expert team are proposing a new policy, and saying that it is good for the country, I will believe them. \nAs an international student, I support this policy simply because it will be good for me. I have seen quite a lot of friends graduated and got employed under OPT status, but failed to get an H1-B visa within the first year. They were forced to either quit the job and go back to their home country, or transfer to an oversea department. Some of them needed to leave their spouse and children behind. And this is just because they got bad luck on that H1-B lottery. An extension of OPT for two years would give them a bigger chance to stay. It is strange to me that a country encouraging immigrants to stay and contribute would stand against such a simple extension that may make a substantiate portion of immigrants happy and grateful. I sincerely doubt this extension policy itself will make much difference on the job market, a much more direct factor would be the H1-B cap that controls the total number of new international workers. If this extension policy doesn't get through, the major effect to me is that I may not want to stay in the U.S. after my graduation because of the higher uncertainty of getting a legal working status, and I think this may be a lot of international students' thought.

As a former international student and now an international worker under H1B visa, I feel the great positive impact brought by Optional Practical Training (OPT) and its extension,  not only on me but to this country - the United States of America in general.\n\nAlmost ten years back When I was deciding which country to study abroad, I considered US as the top choice. One of the important factors is its appealing OPT policy which allows students to work in the US for a period of time after graduation. This is really makes a difference because it allows students like me to gain a lot of precious experience by working in the US, which has the most advanced technology, at the very beginning of our career. Thus the STEM OPT extension policy is even more beneficial in terms of getting experience.\n\nNewton's Third Law states that forces are equal and opposite on objects. That applies to the OPT and its extension too (sorry for being so geeky). While students are enjoy the benefits, the companies they are working for are getting the same benefits that brought by students internship or full time employment. Take myself as an example. I designed a key testing procedure in my first project in my company that dramatically improves the product performance while ensures the product's integrity. This key procedure allows the final product being very competitive on the global market and results in large revenue to the company and to US at large. I've learned similar stories from other friends too. The OPT policy helps companies in the US retains a lot of talented foreigners, which is essential to improving competitiveness.  \n\nIn fact, the OPT extension is even more significant in this sense. Many many research and development projects will take a few years to complete. The extension policy allows students/workers to contribute without interruption. I learned that their are around 34000 students are on extension now and a huge number of others are waiting to apply. If the extension is revoked, just imagine the number of projects will be affected and the loss to those companies. On the large level, it will have a negative to overall US economy for sure.\n\nIn addition to companies in the US, academic institutions in the US have long been receiving the benefit from OPT, especially STEM programs. The OPT and extension policy is a key differentiator for academic institutions to attract international students. I would imagine there will be much less students coming to US if no working permit is granted after graduation.\n\nI strong believe that OPT extension policy will benefit both international students and the US. I sincerely hope that people who holds negative opinions will see the huge benefits from a different perspective.

I got my Master's Degree in Computer Science from UC Davis and am currently working for SAP America. The extended OPT rule will benefit not only international students, but also Americans and US employers.\n\nFor international students including me, OPT serves as an essential factor in attracting us to study in the United States. One of the reasons why I chose to pursue a higher degree in US was because I know I will have many opportunities to enhance my skills in the industry after graduation. The extended OPT, which allows us to work in US for a total of 3 years, will actually give us a pass to participating in interesting projects that often last 2 or 3 years in the field of Computer Science. If I cannot be guaranteed that I will have these experiences, I would prefer go to academic organizations in other countries which are positive to the benefits of international students. \n\nIf this rule will be in effect, however, incoming international students will also bring job opportunities for Americans. With the growing number of young people around universities, the businesses in the surrounding areas will have a better chance to increase their turnover and will need to hire new people in response to the increasing number of customers. It is also possible that this will force the foundation of some brand new kinds of businesses who will be focusing on the needs of international students. New industries will bring much more job openings to Americans with no doubts.\n\nBesides, US employers will also benefit a lot from this rule. For instance in my field, tech companies are eager to bring fresh blood into their production or research team. Given the lack of native workers in the field of Computer Science, talented international students are the perfect candidates and they will bring new ideas and energy, which is incredibly helpful to the whole tech atmosphere in US as what i can see. \n\nThus, I would strongly expect that this rule be approved and exert its effect in helping international students, Americans and employers. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shijia Che", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13905", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "it's a good thing", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by hao qin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18394", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Every time you open the door for foreign markets you take away jobs and money  from American citizens, therefore taking good off the table and increasing the need for government assistance to make ends meet for the working class.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6584", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n\nAdmitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.

Because U.S. can offer the potential students the best practical training opportunity, it became the number one choice for international students. And International students have made significant contributions to the United States both through the payment of tuition and living expenses. In 2013-2014 the number is $26.8 billion. If the OPT extension rule will not be passed, many potential international students will pick other country as their destination to study, such as Canada or Australia and so on.  Almost every countries try to attract more international students to their country. For example Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country. I think the new OPT extension rule follows the trend of the times. And both U.S and international students can benefit from it.\n2.\tNowadays the STEM field need a lot of employees. Almost every country has its policy to attract STEM talents. And STEM international students can alleviate the problem.

These students have proved their outstanding capabilities in their areas of studies by standing out from the recruiting process. The employment of these outstanding foreign students benefits them from gaining valuable and practical STEM work experience. More importantly, it will benefit the U.S. from utilizing these students STEM skills to maintain Americas global competitiveness in the areas of science, technology, engineering and math. With a lead in such areas, America will maintain its leading position in economy across a variety of industries in the world, which in turn will benefit the U.S. citizens overall. \n\nWith the increasing development in the areas of STEM in their countries of origin, many outstanding foreign students may choose to return to their own countries after completing their studies in the U.S.; America will thus lose a large number of talents who would have contributed the U.S. economy and technology development if they had chosen to stay. The proposed STEM OPT extension undoubtedly will reduce the chance of losing these exceptional students and attract more qualified foreign students to seek employment in the U.S., by offering more time of temporary employment upon graduation and additional lottery chances in obtaining H1B visas. Finally, the proposal clarifies rules to safeguard the interests of U.S. workers in related fields. It reassures that this proposal will not harm U.S. workers while benefiting the U.S. for the above reasons.

The immigration diversity helps this country attract a lot of top talent and it is also the reason that USA is and will keep the top 1 position in all the counties of world.\nAll of large successful industries,(for example, the spacecraft invention, the first landing on the moon, the internet technology, even the Hollywood movie industry and so on), are supported by a large group of obscure international people from STEM majors. For example, in lots of famous internet and technology companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple and so on, a large proportion of employees are international people.  These people lead the trend of technology and make a great fortune for USA.  They work hard in every industry & sector and contribute a lot to USA in their own way. They generate USA, and USA also generates them. This is why USA can continue attracting a lot of genius from world and remain its strong.\nAccording to statistics, the technology development in science and industry of USA in recent years is really in proportion to the increase of Tech immigration and international student number.  These international students study and master advanced technology skills in advanced universities of USA. Especially for those who have high level degrees, we have given them a lot of scholarship, we have spent a lot of money on them, so that we should give them more chances and let them make the most use of what they have learnt to contributes to USA. With their contribution, the technology and economy growth they produce will bring a lot of benefits. For example, more job opportunities will be created to USA. Besides, STEM students get things done, generate tax and pay social securities, which is also a kind of fiscal revenue for USA governments.\nNow a lot of companies can apply H1B visa for their international employees. However, unfortunately, there are still a lot of international graduate student cannot get H1B visa because of the limit number of H1B visa. These people have been trained at least one year in companies and have working experience. They have to go back to their homeland and use what they learned in USA to build their own country, which is really an enormous loss for USA. If USA can give these people OPT extension, they will have more chances to stay there and contribute to the development of USA. So, improving and expanding OPT will lead to a win-win situation. It has everything to gain and nothing to lose for USA.\nIn general, OPT extension brings lower cost and more resources for the technology companies. Next generation technologies will bring down the living cost for everyone and create more jobs for America! They are and will be making America greater! So, OPT extension is a good effort for USA to maintain our edge in science and technology.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Chen\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alan Chen", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0455", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule , providing a chance to alll the international students to pursue their dreams while benefiting the tech and US economy", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chandeep Khamba", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6273", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": " A great step by us in the field of stem education.

Due the large volume of high-quality international students, the technology firms and the technology division of non-technology firms have much more choices when they hire, and the candidates are from all over the world (and now  at universities in the US). And because the firms have much more choices, they have more chance to hire the best fit for their job openings, and bring better profit for their firms.\n\n2. Most of the STEM major international students are with very good professional ability, and hard-working, giving them chance to work in the US is apparently doing good to this country, i.e. this country will have more talented people from all round the world to help improve her industry and economy.\n\n3. The US is a very energetic country, and has a lot of great companies and working opportunities, there is really unnecessary to worry international students would hurt the chance of being hired of a US citizen, I mean, if a US citizen is qualified for a job, there is no reason for a firm in the US to hire an international students, even there is OPT and OPT extension for the STEM degree F-1 students.

Moreover the tuition fees paid by them are three time more that American Citizen. Allotting 24 months of OPT results in attracting more Students from foreign countries. We pay these fees and taxes because USA is land of dreams where I can explore my knowledge, skills and social life.\n\n2) A chance to obtain practical Knowledge: After graduating from accredited university the candidate is still clueless because lack of practical knowledge. 24 months OPT helps them to shine their skills and explore the technologies. \n\n3) Patents: Most of the international students graduate with Masters degree. They have SAE ad other papers released. They have patents which can be property of OEM's like GM, FORD and Chrysler. They hire them and sponsor these international students resulting in gaining ownership of those patents. This is very important point because the proportion of patents own by foreign student in USA is considerable and valuable. \n\n4)Companies Attraction because of International student :  Detroit unemployment rate were high but now it has decreased. Its lower that other states in USA now. Because OEM and suppliers all around the world want to do business in Detroit because its motor city and they know they will get reliable resources like International student graduating from accredited universities like \"University of Michigan\".  International Student Employee availability helps the company to integrate their technologies in the USA and hence transferred to locals.

They have benefited a lot from the US educational systems, and if they are forced to go back to their own countries after graduation, it is no doubt a loss for US since they may apply what they learn to the industry and create extra values than what they earn.

Without them, the US will fall in a shortage of advanced researchers and engineers in these areas.

I chose to pursue my master degree in the US not only because of its top notch education, but also the combined OPT program which allow to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further boost the U.S. economy.\nWhy The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months:\nCurrently I work as an RF system test engineer. I involved in several projects such as Quality Assurance Automation framework development; implementing new technology RF test function into our solution, etc. The In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing the projects involved. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n \nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n \nWith this comment, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

I'm an international graduate student from China and will be working in the U.S. soon. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.\n\nSTEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. As a master student, I have had offers from U.S., UK and Germany when applying for graduate school. I came to U.S. because I believe it will better prepare me for a professional career in the OPT and the extension period. Though tuition in U.S., especially in private school, is  huge amount of money, I still feel it worthwhile if I am able to develop professional skills, and also to have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry because I will have excellent resume to bring back to China. One year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.\n\n12 month seems not enough for foreign students to gain enough work experience. For example, some school doesnt have CPT. And if students want to have an internship to get to know more about the industry, they would have used 3 month on internship. And after that, if they feel really interested in working in the  industry in U.S. they would like to seek a full time position. Some companies spend a few month training fresh graduates, so it will only be a few months left for foreign students to contribute professional skills to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company. \n\nIn addition, I believe U.S. employers will benefit from the knowledge, not only professional skills, but also customs and languages of  their own countries from STEM OPT students, and this will give the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast. For example, the Uber China Growth team and TripAdvisor China team will surely need to know more about local market.

I believe most of us who look at things rationally would argue that the hiring process in majority of the companies is completely performance-based and fair. Those who get the job offer are the ones who performed better in interviews. \n\nEven with the extension, international students are still at disadvantage because companies would prefer citizens over international students who had similar performance, and that is totally understandable since companies can deduct expenses not needing to sponsor work visa and citizenship.

My reasons are listed below.\n\nFirst, expanding training opportunities for F1-Nonimmigrant STEM students (F1-STEM) can greatly boost the U.S. economy. After the 2010 financial crisis, many industries, including the financial industry, were negatively impacted. However, thanks to the high quality employees from the F1-STEM graduates, industries like information technology and mechanical engineering, are rapidly growing and thus increasing the performance of the U.S. markets. Many tech companies have announced that they could not have done this without the extremely intelligent employees from the F1-STEM community.\n\nSecond, the training opportunities for F1-STEM students in fact create more jobs are the U.S. citizens. Indeed, due to the fact that many technical jobs are not favored by the U.S. citizens. Many companies had a very difficult time filling in those positions before they meet the F1-STEM employees. By recruiting the F1-STEM graduates, those companies are now able to better grow their business and subsequently expand demands for non-technical positions, i.e. creating more jobs for U.S. citizens.\n\nThird, the cap-gap relief in fact protect the U.S. companies from losing a dramatic amount of money. Many F1-STEM graduates are significantly contributing almost all of the companies. The cap-gap relief can help the companies smooth their work and business without having to wait six months before their F1-STEM can work again.\n\nIn summary, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students\" is an extremely important rule for the U.S. It creates more jobs for the U.S. citizens in the long run, protect the U.S. economy, and enable the U.S. become even more powerful in every single domain.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Han Fang, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18608", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "America will become better with the help of people from all over the world. \n\nImagine an America without foreigners, what it will be like?\n\nPlease respect the contribution of foreigners to America and give them a better chance to live a better life.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Deyang Yin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14995", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Our United States government AND Administrative  employees, Directors, DHS, and anyone concerned with filling STEM jobs should be first and foremost considering US Citizens and Citizens who graduate from our colleges and Universities for any position.

My OPT STEM extension expires in December 2015 and I was hoping this rule which extends the STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months will be implemented sooner so that I can benefit from it too by allowing me to have one more chance at H-1B (I did not get selected last year). Still, I am glad that at least others who are not so close to end of their extension period will be able to benefit from it - my husband being one of them. He completed PhD in electrical engineering from a major university and is working as senior hardware engineer in a reputed company. But his H-1B application did not get selected in the lottery last year either and we are faced with a very real situation of having to leave US and rebuild our future elsewhere. This rule would definitely help him (and thereby, us). \n\nIt would be great if the rule can be implemented in such a way that if people like me who will potentially be in the 60-day grace period after expiration of OPT status when this rule comes into effect can also apply for the remaining 7 months (24 -17) of the OPT extension. This would allow us to have one more chance of applying for H-1B. I have done masters in a microbiology-molecular biology combined program and I currently work as a scientist in a leading diagnostic company where I work on projects that make a real difference for patients and hospitals. My company values me highly for my expertise on the job and they are willing to do anything to keep me working there - but of course, there is nothing that they can do! I have more than 5 years of experience in this field (research + on the job) and yet, I am going to be out of work in December - it is very hard to come to terms with that. \n\nThis STEM extension is absolutely necessary for students graduating in these times - number for applications submitted for H-1B is at an all-time high and consequently the percentage of students who are able to get selected is getting lower every year.  I fail to understand the point of sending away highly skilled workers who were educated here and bringing in lesser skilled foreign workers every year though H-1B. Those big IT consulting companies don't care which of their thousands of applications get selected each year  - they can play with probability game to get a fixed number of workers in every year.\n\nStudents (especially those who spent more that 5 years doing PhD in US) having to go back to their home countries because of this is just not a fair system. I think that this rule should allow for two 24 month extensions to PhD students since they have completed the highest level of education in US - allowing them more chances to apply and get selected for H-1B definitely. Also, I think this rule is essentially forcing undergraduate and masters students to go back to school even if they don't want to just because they did not get selected in H-1B and have to keep status/ get more OPT extension. I might be an idealist, but higher education should be undertaken because the student is actually interested in it - not as a means for getting visa or keeping status. In implementing conditions like these, it is the 'real' students who go to 'real' universities who suffer. In fact, why not just allow two 24 month extensions for all students and allow them to use it however they want to!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Neetha Paul ", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0840", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I Strongly support the OPT 24months extension for stem majors.

It will not only allow many well-educated engineer to work for companies in USA which can highly support the development for high-tech industry, but also provide sufficient working experience for international students to let them better pursue jobs in their own countries. \n\nInternational students have many choices for further their study such as Europe, Canada, Japan and so on. And actually, a lot of students have already chosen other countries, especially German and British. Take my major as an example, Europe has already exceeded United States over 4G communication(and very likely in 5G). Almost everyone using LTE (from Europe) rather Wimax (from USA). But the reason I chose America to further study is because the OPT policy and OPT extension policy. Technology is important, but to find a better job in my country, industry experience is even more essential. If OPT extension is canceled, considerable potential students will change their mind resulting in huge amounts of economy lost in the future:\n    1. Majority of the international students spent money here in United States. They paid not only for tuition fees but also for living expenses including house/apt rent, vehicle purchase and etc. This has helped greatly for the economy in United States. Students rented house from American people, bought cars from American dealers, paid tuition for American Universities. Losing international students will cause huge shock, firstly, on the education institutions then expands to the whole area nearby. \n    2. The culture of United States is integrating. It accepted talent people from all over the world to study and work together which brought up the development for America. Silicon Valley is a good example. Great companies started here, different talents came here and brought thousands of amazing ideas which led the innovation of science and technologies for decades.

They are really worried that if they do not get the extension, some of their projects would have to be put in hiatus and they will not be able to get the experience they are supposed to obtain and put that on their resumes so that they will have more advantages when they go back to their home countries to seek jobs. And I know one of my tenants who is from China, he told me that he already landed a job from a company and he already started training program for 3 weeks. He showed a lot of concerns that if he cannot get the extension anymore, then he has to leave really soon and he will not be able to get much experience.

To bring workers they need into the United States, American companies look for these US graduated STEM workers or sponsor H-1 visas.

Highly skilled foreign workers are typically well educated, English speaking, and young.

Moreover, there is little direct competition between foreign highly skilled workers and similarly skilled Americans. Foreign workers complement American workers and push them into different higher paying occupations. \n\nTo further expand these benets to the American economy, the restrictions and fees levied on H-1B visas and other skilled\nforeign worker visa categories should be removed. Quotas and the temporary time nature of work visas are major\nimpediments to Americans fully reaping the benets that highly skilled workers bring.

Most of the companies asking for more visas are simply engaging in Econ 101 which in part as we all know shows if one can manipulate the flow of labor through immigration policies, one can control wages for the most part.  Expanding the OPT program is also a trick to maneuver around H-1B visa limits.  We should be lowering the number of high tech visas, instead of attacking America's middle class using immigration policies as a weapon. Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor supply for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands and in effect hurt American workers and affect their wages if they are lucky enough to get a high tech job. OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers and hire a non-citizen.  Because OPT workers are students as such, employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these student employees.  That alone would save thousands a year every year as companies employ people in the OPT program.

The proposed OPT program runs afoul of anti-discrimination provisions.\n\nDHS claims that mentoring programs have great value. However, formal mentoring programs are rare in industry. Formal mentoring programs are particularly rare for technology workers.  As such, the proposed rule requires employers and universities to create such mentoring programs from scratch in order to hire aliens on OPT. \n\nIf mentoring programs have the value DHS asserts in the proposed rule, should not Americans have the same benefit? Several commentators have observed that American students cannot get such mentoring programs from industry. E.g. ICEB-2015-0002-3573, ICEB-2015-0002-4756. Why is DHS requiring employers and universities to do so for alien workers?\n\nThe proposed rule requires universities and employers to create a new type of mentoring program that does not exist for Americans as a condition of hiring non-student aliens working on student visas under OPT. However, the proposed rule has no requirement that universities and employers provide the same kind of mentoring program to American graduates. As such, the proposed rule induces employers and universities to discriminate against American workers in violation of  1324b. \n\nThe rule should:\na) Require employers participating in OPT to have formal mentoring and training programs in place for all workers (i.e., including American workers).\nb) Require schools to evaluate the progress of its American graduates participating in such mentoring program the same way they are required to do so for aliens.\n\nAs written and without such requirements, the proposed rule is in violation of  1324b. \n\n9. The new protections for American workers are useless.\n\nIt is commendable that DHS has recognized the abuse in the OPT program by putting in place protections for American workers. Unfortunately, the proposal does nothing beyond recognizing the problem.\n\na) The proposed rule has no enforcement provisions, making it a paper tiger. There is no process to report violations. There is no designated department for enforcement. There is no process for adjudicating complaints.\n\nb) There are no penalties. Employers face no fines if they violate the regulations.\n\nc) There is not even a mechanism for certifying employers for OPT. There should be a process for approving employers as their is for schools so that employers who violate the regulations can be barred from the OPT program. Companies, like IBM, that have been found to openly recruit aliens on OPT to the exclusion of Americans, should be banned from the OPT program.\n\nd) There is no recruitment requirement for American workers. DHS is providing alien workers to industry under taxation rules that make foreign workers inherently cheaper than Americans. The proposed rule says the employers are not supposed to replace Americans with non-student aliens working on student visas, yet there is nothing to prevent them from hiring such workers instead of Americans.\n\ne) The rule ignores the problem of discrimination with employers openly advertising for OPT workers to the exclusion of Americans.\n\nf) The rule ignores the tax benefits for hiring nonstudent aliens working on student visas over hiring Americans.\n\ng) There are no remedies for Americans who, for example, get replaced by OPT workers. E.g., no way to get back pay.\n\nh) There is no ban on using OPT workers for contract labor. Many employers advertise that they hire OPT workers contingent on the alien being contracted out. When the alien is not on a contract, he does not get paid. This practice is called \"benching.\" As with H-1B, OPT should require the full salary be paid to the alien worker for the entire duration of the OPT period. Furthermore, the provisions in the proposed rule are unenforceable if employers can contract out workers. A site visit to an employer in Dallas is useless when the employer can say the non-student alien working on a student visa under OPT is in Seattle.\n\ni) Employers must attest that \"The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity\" but there is no definition of what sufficient resource and personnel are.\n\nj) The rule says that non-student aliens working on student visas must be paid wages \"commensurate with those provided to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers.\" There is no definition of what commensurate means. Is 20% less than what U.S. workers are paid \"commensurate\"? Even the proposed regulation uses air quotes around the word \"commensurate.\" What happens in cases where the employer only hires foreign workers? The proposed rule has no answer. As noted in other comments (e.g., ICEB-2015-0002-4059) this requirement is meaningless when the employer only hires foreign workers.\n\n(continued)\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by John Miano", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9807", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is INSANITY!

The high technology companies, students, and American citizens will all benefit from this regulation.\n\n1: The United States has the most high-tech companies in the word. The companies ranges from IT industry, medicine industry to manufacturing industry. And these industries are the pillar industries of United States. They play a significant role in the nations economic. \nThere is no doubt that, these companies not only have a huge demand on the number of individuals, but also the qualities of people. So, undergraduate, graduate students and PHD students will be the main source of the staff of these enterprises. Nearly half of these students are international students, especially the MS students and PHD students. As a result, the native students are not enough to satisfy the huge demand of the elites. It will have a great impact on the economy of United States.\nOn the other hand, international students who can obtain OPT is excellent. Because, many international students do not have an advantage on the language than native students, the students can obtain OPT must have the perfect professional skills and knowledge. If not, the company will prefer the native students. The professional quality is exactly what the company need. The company need the people who can contribute to its development.\n2: For international students, there are more and more students choose to study abroad. They want to expand their horizons, obtain knowledge and practice themselves. So 12 month OPT are not sufficient for these students, when they practice in company, the time is limited. Its not good for the development of international students. And United States is the country in which international students love to study. So, the extension of OPT can have a good reputation among International students, and will attract more students.\nUnited States has many excellent Universities, many of them are private. So these Universities need the tuition of students to maintain the high standard academic level.\nInternational students will contribute a lot found for the University. The University welcome these excellent international students, for their tuition to run the school, and their distinguished professional quality to improve academic. So both will benefit from this regulation.\n3: The international students will improve the local economy. The international students consumption will improve the local food and beverage and entertainment industry and bring more tax. As a result, the international students increase the local employment and economy. And many students live in the native peoples home, the students can experience the American live, and the native residents can benefit to make life better. \nFreedom and equality is the soul of United States. United States welcome the people from different countries and different culture. And American universities see the diversity of campus as an important factor. So the extension of OPT play an important role for American kinds of industries, culture, economy.\nAs a conclusion, we could not find a reason to cancel the extension of OPT.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yawei Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17258", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We need to take care of our own citizens, not foreign students.

Other people have already explained its benefits so I don't want to repeat what they have already said. Now I will refute some opponents' opinions and prove those opponents to this rule are deadly wrong.\n\n1. Some people claim that OPT will place international student above US students in job market. It's deadly wrong! OPT is merely a temporary work authorization for international students. For US students, they already have permanent work authorization for their entire life. OPT can NOT bring any advantage to international students, compared to the permanent work authorization owned by US students. On the contrary, OPT brings more risks and uncertainty to US employers than US citizens. OPT is temporary while most employers will NOT want to see their employees who have worked for 3 years to leave. So they will have to pay money to help them apply for H1B or EB green card. It will increase the cost to hire international students. So US employers will absolutely hire US students first. They will hire international students ONLY after they find they can NOT find QUALIFIED US students. So US students will still keep their advantage over OPT students and US students will always be the first choice for employers, even if this new proposal becomes official rule. This proposal will NOT affect the competence of US students and US students will always keep its advantage over OPT students, that is, US students are more stable and risk-free.\n\n2. Some people claim that the wage for OPT students is lower than US students and employers may use cheap labor to replace US students. It's also Deadly Wrong, too! The wages of workers are determined by the market and it follows supply-demand relationship. If the demand for workers is high while the supply of workers are low, employees will give high wages to compete for one worker. On the other hand, if the demand is low and supply is high, workers will accept low wages to compete for one job. It's similar in this case. As I mentioned above, US students are more stable and risk-free so every employer will hire US students first. The reason why US students get high salary is that they are in high demand and employers give high wages to compete for them. No employer will gladly give high wages only because the employees are US students. The wages must follow economical rules.High wages indicate high demand. \n\n3. Some people claim that there are enough STEM students. Even if there are enough STEM graduates, it still does NOT mean every Sub-Field in STEM has enough graduates. For example, US is in shortage of graduates with Computer/IT major. That's why most of the H1B are given to Computer Science workers, while very few workers in OTHER STEM field are given H1B visa. So it's necessary to give more working permission to Computer/IT students to meet the demand of US labor market, even if there are enough STEM graduates in OTHER fields.

Yes, unemployment has always been a social issue we all care about and it is the government's responsibility to ensure employment equality. However, international students who have received higher education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the US do not usually compete against the US citizens for jobs in the same category. The fact is, almost all international STEM students target jobs in the high-tech industry, whose prosperity benefits from the talented international students. On average, 25% of high-tech jobs are filled by foreign immigrants (http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2013/05/01/1945941/may-day-immigration/). These people work in the biotech/pharma industry, the information technology industry, the engineering industry, from the biopharma hub of New Jersey across the continent to west coast Silicon Valley, from Seattle to Boston, from New York to Dallas. Without these immigrant works, the American economy will stagger and loses its competitiveness in the the world. \n\nOn the other hand, from the perspective of an employer, it is uneconomical to spend a vast amount of time, energy and money to search, hire and train an employee only to find that he/she can only work in the US for about 2 years due to legal restrictions. In this world, talents matter the most. Not capital, not technology, but talents. Whichever country attracts the most talented people will be the most productive, most creative, and most competitive country in the world. There is no need for me to emphasize this point. Just think about the early 1900's years when the scientists flocked from the Europe to the US. These scientists helped the US to become the most powerful country in human history. \n\nAmerica is proud of its diversity, which is a fundamental element for creativity. It's against the American value to drive international students back to their home country after they have received the best education. It's like training an employee for your competitors. \n\nAll in all, I believe it's for the interest of USA to retain as many talented international STEM students as possible rather than creating legal barriers for them and driving them to the US's competitors.

However, it actually can fill in the void in the US tech industry. As we all know, the STEM opt extension policy has been executed for a few years before, however, theres no opt extension in other majors. This is because, the current local tech talented people can not fulfill the big requirement of both big and start-up tech companies. Actually, the high tech companies need talented people not only from US citizen but also all over the world to build a better products and make our life better. Imagine if the high tech companies stop their pace to make amazing products because of the lack of human resource, it will also have very big negative influence on the US economy. Bad economy brings high unemployment rate. Then it may start a bad cycle.\n\nBesides, some of the comments believe one-year opt is long enough for the students to master the technology studied in school. However, as we know, STEM is much more difficult for students to be proficient. Even if business and liberal arts students need one year opt, students in STEM absolutely need more time to consume knowledge. I can not say if 2-year extension is a real time for the students, but at least more time should be given to STEM students.\n\nIve heard some voices from citizens who simply object this proposal. I can fully understand them because I also dont like not only foreigners even people from other cities stay and work in my hometown. This is because they have different culture from mine which is leaded by different environment we grew up. However, as a rational person, I can not judge things only by my temper because thats so fractious.

I completely disagree with that. In almost all graduate schools in engineering, as has been pointed in the text of the proposed rule, an overwhelming number of doctoral students are international. Hiring an international student is costly for a professor as it limits the type of funding they are pursue for the student. Given the chance professors would prefer hiring US nationals. But despite this advantage, an overwhelming majority of the STEM PhD are international, which points to the fact that there aren't a whole lot of US Nationals to fill the positions in STEM graduate.

The new rule brings lots of benefits to high technology companies in United States. It will make more talents work for high technology companies and make high technology companies more stable. I'm an international student and graduate with a master degree in Computer Engineer. When I was a grad student, lots of grad students were international students, which means the ratio of international students majoring in STEM is very large. Longer OPT extension period could make more talents stay in United States and work for high technology companies. Also, in the high technology company I working for, I noticed that most new hires are international students. With 24 months OPT extension, our company would be more stable, since with longer OPT extension period, more new hires could obtain H1-B and continue to work in United States. If many new hires are forced to leave United States, because of not obtaining H1-B and shorter OPT extension, our company will lose a lot of talents, which is a big loss to our company. Many high technology companies are facing the same problem.  \n \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

I'm an international Mechanical Engineering PhD from China and is an engineer using OPT extension in Virginia. Before I came to US, I had multiple offers to pursue my PhD degree in US, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The most important reason I chose to study here is that US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation in addition to its well known world class education. So OPT extension is very attractive to foreign STEM talents. If this rule is terminated by some reason, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by hundreds of thousands of foreign STEM talents. By just thinking about the abrupt lost of countless talents in the middle of their work as the consequence of the termination of the OPT extension policy, I believe no company can really afford that. The US high tech companies set the standard of the world. The whole world will stop or slow down by losing talents from the US companies.\n\nI think that the new 12 months regular + 24 months extension policy is also a reasonable length for OPT program. Based on my current work experience, most large research/industry development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers working on those projects would lose their VISA before the completion of the projects.\n\nOne more thing worth noticing is that the new policy has proposed to get rid of the so called grey area in the old policy such as the \"volunteer job\". To stay in the US becomes more competitive. Those who can still stay in the US must be outstanding, which in turn will benefit the US society and improve the diversity that the US is proud of.\n\nAs a Chinese STEM student who was born and lived there, I would return to China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market in China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nHope more people support this good rule!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by qian li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18835", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think this is a very good decision, It will help USA in attracting students from other countries for studies and eventually help in growing USA economy.

I think this rule can not only benefit international students, but also boost the economical development of the States.\n\nFirst of all, the reason why most international students choose to further their study in States rather than other countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand is that the States has a reasonable OPT rule. What students from STEM majors really values is not only world famous professors and high-tech laboratories, but also the chance to apply their knowledge into practices. Because the best way to grasp knowledge is to practice by yourself. And OPT extension exactly offers international students this chance. Thus, with regard to our study plan and career development, international students prefer to vote for the States. My cousin, Cheng Zhang, has proved my statement with his choice about abroad study. Two years ago, he decided to further his study of Electrical Engineering. But the alternative choices overwhelmed him. Universities in Canada could offer him fellowship and cover all his tuition, while he could also study in high-rank universities in England, such as Imperial College and University College London. After several days' consideration, he chose to go to America because only in America could he work for several years after graduation, which he thought was the most important and beneficial to his career. So, to attract more students to pursue master degree and Ph.D, this new OPT extension rule should be passed.\n\nWhat's more, the individuals of the States can actually benefit from this new rule. OPT extension means more time to work in the States, which provides the local areas with more workforce and need for consumption. These graduates students will work hard to sharp their skills and, more important, they will spur the economical development of local areas. More supermarkets and restaurants will be built to offer them food and groceries. They may also go to watch movie in cinema and go fishing or hiking in international parks. So more jobs opportunities will be created to satisfied the booming needs of these people. The unemployment rate can be decreased a lot and the GDP of local community can increase tremendously. If the OPT extension is canceled, the downtown will never be as prosperous as today and homeless people will crowd in the corner at midnight bothering neighbors. As we can see, this new rule can indeed bring peace and prosperity to the community of America.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xinhong Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15047", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Mentorship training program should not be made mandatory for employers to train STEM OPT students as it will effect employment opportunities of STEM OPT students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ajay Reddy Yeruva", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20033", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally agree with this proposal, first of all, US is an immigration country, and because of this, us technology is developing so fast.

They can contribute to America to be better and bring more productivity and values. As far as I know, every year there are a large amount of talents leaving from the United States, because they could not get H1B. That is huge losses for those companies where they are in and also losses for our America. If the Training Opportunities period can be extended, these talents will have more chances to get the H1B, which means they will have more opportunities to benefit this beautiful country.\n\nSecond, the extension of OPT can provide more powerful safeguards to industries in various fields to find more suitable talents and staff. For a company, it is not easy to find a very suitable employee. So with the expanding of OPT, American companies will gain more selection.\n\nThird, America is a country with a dream. She absorbs a large number of talents coming here to contribute to the country, since she never refuses people who have a dream. OPT extension gives international students more equal opportunities to realize their dream.

First, America is known as the land of opportunity and everyone has a chance to succeed no matter the race, gender and etc. Having the STEM provision for foreign students helps them to find employment, give back to local community and make a career in this most developed country. Why would the American dream shut down to those talented students as they are striving for success? Second, the STEM employment is by no means depriving the benefits of local citizens. Yes there are more engineer and science students from abroad to come to the states to study, but they earned the degree by huge tuitions (double or triple of the tuitions than local students which is understandable as to protect the locals as the institutions is fed by local people's taxes too), and years of hard effort (like the PHD students). They did not steal the job from the other citizens, or entered the country illegally and purely consume resource without working. Why would they be taken away the opportunity to earn a better life with their special skills? Third, thousands and thousands students chose American higher education institutions over UK, France, Australia and many other developed countries, not only for the top knowledge, but because of the various industry experiences that are beneficial for their further development, in the States, their home country, or worldwide. STEM is a big part of it that attracts those top students. Would we want to give up these talents and have them go to other countries to help them compete with America? Fourth, For majority of the STEM subjects, a research program or business project lasts for a couple of years and the original 12 month program is not sufficient for them to earn enough experience, which further means, that a US degree is less competitive for them comparing to other countries. Without certain years of experience, they are not treated any differently in the job market when they come back home. Therefore, there will be less and less students willing to come to US higher education institutes, which would, probably, a great financial loss for both the universities and local communities.

I came to US in 2008 and am currently finishing my PhD. The education provided a rich depth of knowledge in field of semiconductors. But when I recently started to apply for full time positions, most of the openings require some sort of experience. This makes me ineligible to apply for most of the currently available jobs. \n\nThe 12 month OPT period will provide me with time to gain experience and build my professional resume. However, in order to work as a full time employee in US, I have to apply for a H1B visa in April next year. This will ensure that I can stop my OPT training period and continue as a full time employee. \n\nHowever, the allocation of H1B is done completely based on luck. The lottery system does not guarantees fairness to PhD students who spend much longer time in completing their graduate studies over MS students. Further, PhD students are a better value addition to US workforce compared to MS students. So, preference should be given to PhD students as far as allocation of H1B visa is concerned.\n\nIf I do not get a H1B visa awarded in the lottery system (which is completely unfair and does not take into account any merit based allocation of visas), I have to leave the country at the end of my 12 month OPT period. This means that I will have to leave country for a year and hope to get lucky in the lottery system next year. However, this is not guaranteed and I may have to wait several years before I may get a H1B visa. \n\nThis is a terrible misuse of money and effort which goes towards training STEM students, especially students who spent 5-8 years getting a PhD degree. Federal government and different funding agencies spent a considerable amount of money training a skilled work force. This workforce should be allowed to assimilate and contribute back to the prosperity of US economy. \n\nThere is already a shortage of skilled labor force in US. Terminating work authorization for STEM students will erode the strong and highly skilled workforce which US needs in order to stay competitive in this global economic environment. US is slowly losing its manufacturing jobs to India, China and other developing countries. In order to stay competitive, US needs to lead in higher technology and research environments which will help to maintain its dominant leader position. Throwing out thousands of high skilled STEM students will be a huge blow to struggling US economy.\n\nThank you for patiently reading my letter.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mayur Bubna, Purdue University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0574", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I believe increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months is necessary for students to fully utilize the education they received in the form of practical training and hence I completely support this new change.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dhananjayan Ramesh", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2415", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree that STEM OPT should be expanded for boosting US economy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tommy Lu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21180", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "After personally reviewing the pro's and con's of this proposed rule I find I am not in favor of it because of the damage it will will do to the US Economy, US Citizen workforce who are in college or an accredited degree for jobs in this field.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\n    the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n    \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS:\nI am disappointed that my own government and my own citizens would consider such a rule that undermines the American dream, greatness and worse of all, its' own citizen.\n\nThis rule should not be considered.

Competition makes science and technology moving forward faster. International students bring a more motivated academia and research atmosphere.\n\nUniversities and companies, especially for top tier universities and high tech companies, have very high requirements for candidates' selection, especially for international students. Most of these high qualified international talents work in core technology department in companies, such as Research & Department department. They are making huge contributions to technology in United States and United States needs them badly. \n\nCompanies hire someone based on his/her qualifications and skills rather than nationalities. They will not hire a useless person just because she/he is a citizen. \n\n2.\tPractical training is part of education. The purpose of education is to utilize the knowledge learned to solve the practical problems. \n\nInternational students pay very expensive tuition (much more than citizen), living expenses and taxes which makes huge contributions to American economics. In return, international students should have the right to apply their knowledge to real work. Optional practical training should be long enough to let the international students encounter and solve different kinds of problems exist in practical work. \n\n3.\tIf this proposal were not passed, there will be fewer international students study in America. It will bring huge economic loss for both universities and companies which will hinder academia and technology development dramatically.\n\nInternational students' tuition is biggest part of profit for universities. If less international students come for study, there will be huge loss for university to support its faculty and facility.\nThe quality of teaching and graduates will be lowered definitely. \n\nIf the proposal were not passed, most companies will lose many talented and core staff which will hinder companies operation and competitiveness. The economics will be influenced badly.\n\n4.\tDiversity is one of most important culture of America. \nAmerica consists of people from all over the world because it attracts and appreciates talented people. International students bring their culture and costume to this country which is good for America to absorb best part of culture of each nationality.  In this case, America keeps strong and advanced.\nInternational talents with multicultural background could have a different insight when dealing with problems. Many companies in America have business all over the world. International staff will be perfect bridge to connect business between two countries.  They are playing a very important and unique role in America and cannot be replaced. \n\nThis is a very wise proposal which will make huge contributions to American's education, technology and economics.

The best source of that skilled workforce is the foreign nationals educated in the US universities. \n\nThe U.S. job market is not a \"zero-sum game\" in which workers must fight each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has the most dynamic and powerful economy the world has ever known, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked shoulder to shoulder with native-born workers to build it.\n\nThe overwhelming weight of research shows that in our dynamic labor market, skilled immigrants complement their U.S.-born counterparts. Skilled immigrants' help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign workers positively impact the wages and employment opportunities of native-born workers across our economy.\n\nThe important role that skilled immigrants play in our economy extends far beyond the world of computers and high tech, and skilled immigrants are helping to reshape communities far beyond Silicon Valley. They are making enormous contributions in almost every aspect of our economy, including manufacturing, medical research, healthcare delivery, and agriculture. Their contributions have helped rebuild economies in places like Des Moines, Iowa; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nFor me, the bottom line is this:\n\nIn today's global economy, where other countries are spending billions of dollars to compete with America's ability to attract immigrants, we cannot take this issue for granted. If we continue to ignore the need for immigration reform or adopt policies that discourage skilled immigrants from helping America to innovate, lead, and create more high-paying jobs we run the enormous risk that America will be left behind, without a robust innovation and entrepreneurial sector.\n\nInnovation is the key to growing the U.S. economy and creating jobs. In turn, the key to innovation is attracting, growing, and retaining a skilled workforce. Foreign-born workers, especially STEM workers, have been and will continue to be a critical part of this equation.\n\nThe policies, similar to this proposed rule, will help us fulfill the promise of an immigration system that serves a 21st century, global economy, while protecting the rights and promoting opportunities for all workers.\n\nResearch supports the creation of a revamped and revitalized immigration system with updated visa caps and the elimination of per-country quotas; a system that retains talented individuals who were educated in the United States. We need a system that supports STEM education right here at home; a system that encourages compliance with rules and safeguards against exploitation and abuse; and that allows for more flexibility, predictability, and consistency.\n\nThe good news is that these reforms are achievable, and that lasting immigration reform is within our reach. The key to success is to not pursue these issues in isolation. Maximizing the economic contributions of skilled immigrants is important work, but it is only one component of the broad based reforms our system desperately needs. We must realize that immigrant job creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators come in all shapes and sizes. They come to our shores not only through employment-based channels but through family reunification and as refugees and asylees. They can also be found within the population of unauthorized workers.\n\nThe importance of reforming our systemall aspects of itto further our prosperity cannot be overstated. We owe it to ourselves and our future to once again support and pass bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that is good for business, good for workers, and good for families.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Harris Reynolds", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2285", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the rule about OPT extension.

Any increase in H-1 visas for such workers is, therefore, unjustified\n\n\nUsing the most common definition of STEM jobs, total STEM employment in 2012 was 5.3 million workers (immigrant and native), but there are 12.1 million STEM degree holders (immigrant and native).\n\nOnly one-third of native-born Americans with an undergraduate STEM degree holding a job actually work in a STEM occupation. \n\nThere are more than five million native-born Americans with STEM undergraduate degrees working in non-STEM occupations: 1.5 million with engineering degrees, half a million with technology degrees, 400,000 with math degrees, and 2.6 million with science degrees. \n\nAn additional 1.2 million natives with STEM degrees are not working  unemployed or out of the labor force in 2012.\n\nDespite the economic downturn, Census Bureau data show that, between 2007 and 2012, about 700,000 new immigrants who have STEM degrees were allowed to settle in the country, yet at the same time, total STEM employment grew by only about 500,000. \n\nOf these new immigrants with STEM degrees, only a little more than a third took a STEM job and about the same share took a non-STEM job. The rest were not working in 2012. \n\nOverall, less than half of immigrants with STEM degrees work in STEM jobs. In particular, just 23 percent of all immigrants with engineering degrees work as engineers. \n\nIn total, 1.6 million immigrants with STEM degrees worked outside of a STEM field and 563,000 were not working. \n\nThe supply of STEM workers is not just limited to those with STEM degrees. Nearly one-third of the nation's STEM workers do not have an undergraduate STEM degree. \n\nWage trends are one of the best measures of labor demand. If STEM workers are in short supply, wages should be increasing rapidly. But wage data from multiple sources show little growth over the last 12 years. \n\nReal hourly wages (adjusted for inflation) grew on average just 0.7 percent a year from 2000 to 2012 for STEM workers, and annual wages grew even less  0.4 percent a year.

Being a STEM student myself, I am currently working as a financial risk analyst at a bank with my OPT. I was hired in February this year. It took around three months for me to get full access to the company's system and get a basic understanding of the workflow in my team. My manager assigned me some simple work after the first three months, and I have been handling those work for around four months. Now, after 9 months working in this industry, I am able to complete many projects with high quality. I am also assigned more challenging work and will often come up with new ideas to add value to my work. However, I realize that there are still so many things that I need to learn.\n\nWhat I am trying to say here is that, from my observation, the jobs at the banking industry and other industries that have complicated structure and require extensive scientific analysis really require a long learning period. For the first several months, I think most new hires cannot add much value to the company and they are actually paid to learn. Not after a few months or even one year are they fully capable to handle more important work and valuable to the company. From this point of view, I think the extension will be beneficial both to the students and to the companies in the US, because in the second 12 months period, the students are more likely to make greater contributions to the company and add value to their work. On the other hand, if the extension is too short, students tend to leave their work before acquiring full knowledge to it and adding true value to it, and the companies tend to train the new employees for nothing.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Aoqiang Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19578", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Stop pandering to big business and insist they hire and train American workers and students and pay them a living wage.

The Regulation deflect the issue away from this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world. Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student\".\n\nThis logic is flawed, when a student is employed by a company, he/she is an employee and will be judged in the same category as US workers. There is no \"apple vs orange\" comparison. Also, if a similarly situated US worker is not found, that exactly proves the student's skills are very in need and this should further qualify his/her employment. Also, as an international student working in US worker, I have at least three US colleagues that perform similar work as I did and earn similar salaries as I do.

Is it practical or meaningful to have such a mentoring program? As an employee in US company, we know that employees should be proactive.

STEM majors (e.g. Engineering, Math etc) are the core and the base of the major thriving industries in US, with very well-known examples such as investment banking institutions (e.g. Goldman-Sachs), technology-based corporations (e.g. Facebook, Google), pharmaceutical industries (e.g. Johnson & Johnson), and so on. And currently there are millions of foreign employees, many working under the OPT rules, contributing their effort and time to the thriving of these companies and the steady growth of US. It must be acknowledged that these foreign employees do have their own advantages that make them irreplaceable, and a very easily-understandable reason is that these foreign employees (or F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM majors) are mostly educated with a much more solid background in math and engineering in their own countries before coming to US for advanced education (e.g. college, graduate school), which places them in a more favorable position for employers since employers always look for the candidates with the best expertise. This means that the loss of this group would be a disaster to the US but good news to all the other countries in the world since such a talent pool would have the only option to return to their own countries and start working there.   \n2. Extending the OPT duration for F-1 nonimmigrant students would also benefit the general growth of US in the sense that a significant portion of F-1 students come to US not just for the educational purposes; they wanted a few years of working experience in the US before returning to their own countries to practice their career, and STEM majors OPT extension would exactly satisfy their purposes since it allows a 3-year experience for those F-1 college graduates. On the other hand, if STEM OPT extension is not approved, there would be a drastic drop on the number of potential F-1 students who want to pursue education in the US, since their goals can no longer be met. A direct result is the undesired increase in US college tuition since the universities are losing a significant source of students (income) and they need the money to maintain operation.

So OPT extension plays a very important role in the process, as I major in math. Without this OPT extension policy, The US could not have been attracting so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge and passion to this country, and I probably would have chosen to study in another country with better policies.

In addition, it is against fact to believe that the minimum wages cannot get raised just because there are too many international students. I strongly agree that extending the opt extension is of greatly significance, and allowing international students to work in US will bring far more jobs and contribute to the US economy rather than its drawbacks.\n\nFirst, international students are making huge contributions to our country. Most international students work in the scientific and technology area, and many of them become the best in their fields. People cannot imagine how many losses will bring to our IT companies, academia, industry and other fields if the international students are rejected outside the country. Thus, STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. The money and benefits that the international students created are actually used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.\n\nSecond, the minimum wages are nearly nothing to do with the international students. Actually, US government has been protecting the Mexican immigrants and giving their rights to immigrate to the country for many years. From my observation, Mexican immigrants are mostly working in the low income area which bring down our minimum wages, while the international students, however, most come from the elites of their countries. Many of them are seeking for highly rewarding positions like software engineer and web developers, where we do not want to work in because of the high working pressures. The international students are by no means cheap labor.  Meanwhile, though international students prefer to work in the IT companies and technology related area, it is not their responsibility for the current salary level in these area. There are thousands of competitors outside the US who want to hire the US educated students to work in their companies, and want to replace the top place of our companies. They will definitely bring down the US economy and steal our jobs! Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains outside of the country. If STEM students go back to their countries and other welcoming countries once rejected in US, they will devoted to the scientific, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the countries they serve for. Once we start to do so, it will undoubtedly have a great impact on our economy!\n\nThird, American people are wise enough not to harm the long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. We should NOT only concern about the short-term competitions temporarily brought by the international students. Competitions are EVERYWHERE. Since we become human beings, we stood out from other species of world, there are competitions. Proper competitions can increase the efficiency of our country, accelerate development, and benefits us all. If we reject international student outside of the country, how can we educate our children from now on? Telling them to become scared of competitions and becoming self-satisfied by ourselves, or let the irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest? \n\nAdmittedly, to some extend I agree that international students' participation in the job market would slightly increase the competitions in the short term. However, the benefits and money they contribute to the country is far more than the competitions they will bring to US. I strongly support the STEM system and expanding 24 months training opportunities for F-1 students with all STEM degrees.\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kelly Zhang, University of Michigan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13782", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a f-1 student, a foreigner, and I STRONGLY support this extension. Here is my opinion.\nAbsolutely, many alien students like me thinks we can obtain benefits from this extension.\nNow, I will comment from the angle from the people from United States.\nAt first, this extension is the CORE competence when international students to choose a country to study  at least it is true for myself. I am a Chinese and there are more and more teens plan to go outside to study. Going to United States always become one of the best choices, comparing to other countries, because we think OPT can give us a pretty good chance to practice and gain experience of the professional knowledge. This extension, obviously, will attracts more students come to United States. The competencies is more intense,  means two excellent benefits for education. Firstly it means that the quality of the international students will much better than before, very helpful for the colleges' development and the overall quality among the world. Secondly international students always bring a good financial resources for the colleges to develop themselves. \nSecondly, for the whole development for society of United States. The students belong to STEM majors usually have many different technical skills. It is obvious to see the wealth created by those people, such as there are a lot of engineers in those IT companies. Some people from America may thinks that those foreigners grabs their money and opportunities. For that I want to say if the government cancels the OPT extension just because they want to protect those 'lazy' people, it is totally short-sighted. Besides the direct wealth come from us, we also improve the overall quality of citizens, helpful for America to become a 'high-quality' people's country.\nSo now I need to talk about the immigration. Comparing to 17-month extension, I am very sure this 24-month extension will decrease the application of Green Card, at least for myself. And it also decreases the pressure for H1B's apply. We do not need to worry about the draw, instead it is pretty good for us to make a long-term plan for life. For me, I can plan earlier to find a good position in China and do the things as plan.\nWhy so many organizations worry about the talented people who will bring positive influence, both in education and the whole society? As we can see, these benefits can make a virtuous circle, always bring United States positive feedback in many years.

Big names like IBM, Microsoft, Google, Apple not only changed the way people live but also gained themselves great wealth. It is hard to imagine how the States would be today without these landmark companies. Scientific research is of equal importance: it serves both as the very foundation of technology growth and reaches out to find possible directions of the human society. \n\nBut we all know that the sustainable improvement of both tech industry and scientific research, however, relies highly on students graduating from STEM majors. And one fact we cannot ignore is that a significant proportion of STEM students are non-immigrant international students. Now all international graduates have to face an annual H1B lottery draw to obtain a legal working permit in the U.S.. Had we limit their time for OPT extension, much less of them would succeed in finding a job in the U.S., which would be a great loss for the states. Given this 24-month extension they will be more comfortable to find a job, attend multiple H1B draws, and more likely to plan their career in the U.S. and make contributions to this society.\n\nAs a F-1 student in STEM, I really appreciate the chance that I can study in the States and probably enter the S&T industry in the future.

Company never wants to hire us ,they are eventually bound to ,  priority is always and always given to the american people but the problem is american population is no where close to the skills set and talent what these small and large scale companies are looking for , that being said the smarter section of american population , even the mediocre one gets the job easily. Here is quote from CEO of a tech company - \n\n\"You hire a person, who is extremely well educated, and you get them to come work for you, and you have a 70% chance that they're not going to be able to stay,\" von Ahn told me. \"It's terrible, because even if you hire super smart people, it takes a couple months to train them. They don't start becoming very useful to the company until about six monthsand then they have to leave.\"\n\nIf the STEM extension isn't reinstated, he said, \"we're probably going to lose two employees who were really hard to hire,\" a big problem for a small company like Duolingo with only 50 employees. \"All these extremely well-educated people are probably going to go to some other country and make that country better.\"\n\nVon Ahn said he'd much prefer hiring a U.S. citizen or someone who already has a job permit because it's simpler and cheaper. But \"we have to hire [international students] because we can't find anyone who's as good as they are,\" he said. \"Sometimes they're the best of the best, literally, in the world.\"   \n\nNow to prove this further let me post the job requirements of a xyz electrical company and compare that with the resume of a highly qualified stem worker ( immigrant Vs a local worker) \n\nJob Responsibilities\n\nUnder the direct supervision of a Senior Engineers and Project Managers, this candidate will be responsible for the following:\n\nPerforming design, computations and evaluations associated with the design and construction administration of power distribution, emergency generators, I&C systems, fire alarms, CCTV systems and lighting design.\nPerforming project administration including gathering information, writing reports, drafting proposals, drafting correspondence, tracking project costs, and completing progress reports.\nCoordination with other engineering and architecture departments within the firm\nClient interaction and teamwork with other disciplines.\nOther duties as assigned\n\nnow an average Immigrant resume will meet 90 to 100 percent of the job description where as the average local will meet only 10 to 20 % of the job description , those who meet even 50 % are hired straight away , its much easier to hire them than us anyways , but most satisfy only 10-20 % of the requirement, so there lies that problem. In other words immigrants have a significant contribution in driving the economy.and they cannot be replaced in any ways ...  and every immigrant on average creates 2.6 more jobs , OPT is the only way highly talented people can stay here and create more jobs , remove them and with no one to fill their positions the company will suffer badly and the schools even worst ..here is another way to put it according to national science + math initiative -\n  Sixty percent of the new jobs that will open in the 21st century will require skills\npossessed by only 20 percent of the current workforce. The U.S. may be short as\nmany as three million high-skills workers by 2018. Two-thirds of those jobs will\nrequire at least some post-secondary education. Someone should try their best to bridge the gap between between high skilled STEM foreign Graduates VS Locals , unless the skill level gap is as huge as it is right now , kicking us will only harm the economy massively \n\nstudents currently reading under STEM field (internationals) = 55000 or more (45000 is solely for engineering) \n   total loss to the universities =  $21600000000 which is equal to 0.216 Trillion dollars !!!! \ntotal loss to the economy as in jobs = 1.7 trillion dollars  ( us beuro of labor and statistics), how will you recover that ..increase the taxes overall to reduce the huge federal deficit , who will suffer its you !?  \n\n Further , According to a 2012 report from the Information Technology Industry Council, the Partnership for a New American Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, research has found that \"every foreign-born student who graduates from a U.S. university with an advanced degree and stays to work in STEM has been shown to create on average 2.62 jobs for American workersoften because they help lead in innovation, research, and development.\n\nRemoving the brighest talents will have catastrophic effects in future.

I think the extension is beneficial to both the industries related to STEM Degrees in the US and F-1 nonimmigrant  students.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, companies in the US need to go through many troubles if they want to hire a foreigner. They need to go through legal processes that require both time and money. However, there are still thousands of American companies,big or small, which keep hiring foreigners, including F-1 nonimmigrant students. Why? The most reasonable answer I think is that there is a shortage in the workforce the companies need. It is even more so for the companies in the fields of STEM. Extending OPT helps making up for the shortage of the workforce and helps boosting the US economy because international students can stay in the US longer and make more contributions. Without the extension, it is harder to attract international talents in the fields of STEM to America and force the ones who are already there to leave early. In my opinion, one reason why America is the strongest country in the world is its ability to attract talents from everywhere and embrace them regardless of their race, genders, age and nationalities. I would even say that without this extension, the American Economy will  become much less prosperous.\n\nHaving the opportunity to work in the US for a longer time helps international students gain more experience in their fields of study. Personally, I want to work in the US for a couple of years and then go back to China, because my whole family is there and the amount of opportunities there is comparable to that in the US. However, the competition is more fierce in China in my field of study. Without any experience, it is very hard to get a good job. I have been living and studying in the US for six years. It's a good place and I am familiar with it. Software industry is still booming in the US and help pushing the US economy forward. It has world leading companies and I am very interested in the day-to-day new technologies coming out here in the US. I believe with the experience I gain in the US, I will become more competitive in the job market in China, and at the same time I can make considerable contribution to the US economy.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\n \n\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\nSincerely,\n\nSatya Abhishek Nistala", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Satya Abhishek Nistala, Intel Corporation", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2865", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I Strongly support the proposal.\n1.

America needs work for its own people. Few if any other countries would be so foolish.

The proposal is yet again creation of scab labor by another name.\n\nThere are plenty of foreign students to give cultural \"seasoning\" to American academic life. More foreign students and less American students who can afford an education in this country in competition with foreign students is not in this country's interest. We are heading to a foreign technical elite running the technical life of this country which to no small degree is already underway.

Certainly American students studying in their countries to take their local jobs would never, ever be tolerated.\n\nAmericans wanting to participate in the advanced skill job market will be increasing forced to seek cheaper education outside of the US, completely reversing what should be considered desirable. Ever more marginally funded public State schools look for the big bucks from foreign students rather than catering first to their citizens. This program will take one more step towards converting every public institution of higher learning into a private school for the global elite.\n\nIncreasingly the current generation of young males seeing what is happening have simply become discouraged and dropped out of advanced education altogether.

What we are being forced to withstand is NOT within reason.   \n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nAs senator Grassley has stated in a letter to president Obama: \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations.

These scholars now form the indispensable force of scientific and technological advances of the nation. With the former success of welcoming these former international students, it is unreasonable to stop at this point by cancelling the OPT extension. International students introduce diversity to this nation, which keeps stimulating the creativity of this nation as it did in the past decades. The lose of brain power is fatal to a nation with renown of creativity and innovation. This nation had already cancelled the plan of Superconducting Super Collider at Texas in 1993, which abnegated the authority and the frontier of high energy physics to CERN. Are we going to continuously giving up our FIRST PLACE in other fields as well? At this point, it is unwise to stop the OPT-extention to reject creativity and diversity from enter this nation.\n\nSome may argue that the extension of OPT results in increasing pressure of the job market, but this is only short-term effect. Competition will in the long term benefit this country. It is true that some immediate effect will assuage the job pressure, but considering the long term loss of the nation in competitive ability by locking it door to the diverse ideas from the rest of world, the reduction of job pressure in this way should be carefully reconsidered, about whether it is wise or not to sacrifice long term benefit for short term profit.\n\nThe United States can never have enough talents and innovation no matter in the past or in the future. At this point it is crucial to continue the OPT-extension to welcome new talents to maintain the leading position in innovations.

The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation.

The expansion of OPT session for STEM students is to interest of Unites states' core competence.\nThese STEM international student holding advanced degree are high-end scientists, engineers, which could make huge contribution to the science research, technology development.  American always value technology, which actually benefits the nation and let America lead the world for decades.  You can think tons of examples easily. Just check American's receipts of Noble prizes, you have to admit a large portion of them were international students first and them immigrate to U.S.  \n\nMoreover, these STEM advanced degree holders helped and will continue helping the economy's bloom of U.S. High-tech industries relies on engineers and scientists. And the profit of high-tech technology is huge and has been the contributing the economy for decades.  \n\nYou can find the counties like China are trying have to attract these STEM graduates to build their economy and high-tech industries.  Losing these people is degrading the core competence for United States. \n\n2. The expansion of OPT session for STEM students is in accordance with America's principles and foundations. Diversity, equal opportunities and freedom are the key principles of this nation and very important for the U.S.  \nAmerican have been selling the \"American dream\" idea to attract the talents across the world, and this expansion proposal is the real thing needs to be done!  These students with advanced degree won't steal the job opportunities from the U.S. citizen, they are getting jobs that are lacking the human resources.  From the interest of themselves, they are just chasing a better life, their American dreams.  I believe for these potential scientist and engineers, they won't find much difficulties to find a job in other countries if they have to leave American. All they find is the regression to chasing their \"American dream\".  At the end of the day, they believe it's their human rights to chase a better life, and they don't hurt anyone.\n\n3.

What makes U.S. the best country in the world now. The talent people!\nU.S. has the best universities in the world (see how many U.S universities ranked in Top 100 in the world).\nThey attract the most talent people from the other countries to study in U.S.\nEspecially for the STEM students, they are the future of U.S. We should make every effort to keep the best students stay in U.S.\nIt is stupid that we kick out those PhDs, Masters from universities like Harvard, MIT, etc.\n\n2. What benefits can U.S. have if we keep the best students?\nThose best students will be entrepreneurs, professors, scientists, engineers, doctors in every domain.\nThey will significantly make contribution with their expertise and keep those area like IT, Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc. the best in the world.\nTheir next generation will also inherit their talent and diligent and keep us competitive globally.\nFurthermore, while the illegal immigrants and lazy citizens are dragging down U.S. economy, the foreign legal employees are trying very hard to simulate the U.S. economy.\n\n3. What could be lost if U.S. kick out those STEM students?\nCompanies like Amazon, Google, Apple, Tesla, etc cannot hire enough excellent people.\nIn long term, they will lack of good ideas and ability to innovent. \nOn the other hand, companies from European, India, Japan, or China will raise because they can hire the talent people we kick out.\nImagine you are using Computer brands from India, Phone from European, Search and social media from Chinese companies, using cars only from Korean.\nThen U.S. will be a second-tier country or even worse.\nThe talent students from the world will not come to U.S. universities.\nU.S. will be like the counties in South American, because we have a lot of our own problems if we cannot make more money.\n\n4. Will the STEM students take away jobs from U.S. citizen?\nNo. The number of STEM students is actually very less comparing with the number of job opennings or comparing with 40+ millions of illegal immigrants.\nThe students get OPT approval from 2010-2014 are only about 26,000 (vs. 40,000,000 illegal immigrants!!!).\nAlso there are not many U.S. citizens with STEM degree simply because those area are pretty hard and we don't want to do it.\nU.S. citizens with STEM degree are not hard to find jobs because companies will always hire U.S. citizens before hiring foreigners.\nIf there are U.S. citizens cannot find job with STEM degree, that only means they are not good. If they cannot find job in U.S., they cannot find job in everywhere in the earth.\nAnd even more, because 40% of largest U.S. companies founded by Immigrants or their children, they created, creating, and will create lots and lots of high quality jobs.\nIt means the U.S. citizens will be earlier to have job if we keep STEM students.\n(http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/04/25/40-largest-u-s-companies-founded-by-immigrants-or-their-children/)\nThe only people taking away U.S. jobs are the illegal immigrants, the jobs they took are the jobs does not require any special skills, a lot of U.S. citizens lost job because of them.\n\n5. How to distinguish the good STEM students?\nYes, we agree we need to keep the STEM students, but are we worry that we may also keep the students who are not talent?\nThe answer is no, we don't need to worry.\nEven in the IT industry which has probably the highest number of job openning, it is not easy to find a job for the foreign students.\nThe talented students will have no problem finding job, and the other students cannot find jobs in 3 month will be kicked out.\nThe companies already help the country to select people.\n\n6. Is the OPT extension rule good enough?\nNot enough.\nEven the students have the OPT extension, they still have trouble getting working visa, then have trouble getting green card.\nIt is stupid that we want to keep them and then let them have several rounds of suffering.\nThe good solution should be that the PhDs hired should be granted green card immediately.\nThe masters should have at least 5 years OPT so they don't need to have H1B.\nFor H1B quota every year, government should invest those people filed several applications (some people filed more than 10 applications).\nThe government should also ban ICC companies like iGate Technologies, Syntel Consulting, Syntel, Wipro Limited, etc. they took a lot of H1B quota and companies like Google, Apple cannot keep their employee.\nFinally we should increase the quota for U.S. graduates.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chao Yang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5938", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The OPT program does nothing but give employers a way to hire cheaper workers.

We have more talents than any other country. United States has become and is being a huge magnet in the past 100 years. But this trend will end soon if we decide to kick out these talents. You might argue that these international students grabbed job opportunities from our young people.

The path for international students to a job is actually very narrow: they have to perform much better than their American classmates for a job offer. Then they need to qualify H1-B visa: you will be paid APPRICIATE WAGE. Attention here, if a company decides to hire an international student, they need to pay MORE. So it is clear that which is cheaper for the companies. You can find some explanations of H1-B visa requirements here:\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/eir/visa-guide/h-1b-specialty-occupation/understanding-h-1b-requirements\nMany H1-B holders will apply for EB-1 or EB-2 green card program.

You can find the requirements here:\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2\nIf you apply for EB-2, the company has to prove that they cannot hire an American who can qualify this job even if they publish the job ad. So you have seen the problem: the international students are filling the space left by Americans and our young people do not have skills to fill them. If they can, it would be more costwise to hire Americans for companies.\nMeanwhile, these talents from other countries are providing more job opportunities to Americans by defending our leadership in advanced technologies and innovations. Actually, we are losing this leadership because more international students prefer to go back. You might not know that Huawei, a Chinese company, has published a new ARM chip, Kirin 950, whose performance score is even better than Qualcomm CPU. Many developers in that Chinese team were international students in our university. If we cannot keep them in the US, we will use our resource to cultivate our competitors. For whom did not know this, check out this news:\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/watch-out-qualcomm-huaweis-new-kirin-950-smartphone-chip-looks-beastly/\nIf our companies cannot maintain the leadership, our economy can be worse and more people will lose their jobs. This would be a vicious circle. \nThe real solution is not shutting doors to international students. It should be a reform of our education system. According to ACT.org, \"Just 40 percent are ready for their first course in college Algebra, and, while better, still only 68 percent are ready for college coursework in English Composition.\"  This situation got even worse in graduate schools.\nMost STEM graduate schools are occupied by international students from China and India. After that, we have seen that the number of professors with international background has been increasing dramatically in the past 10 years. \nYes, we are facing a crisis. But the correct solution is not to shut the doors. This can only make things worse. We should make our America larger and stronger. Kicking out the talented competitors would give us a temporary relief. But painkiller cannot cure. We need to better education to make our young people more competitive instead of kicking out these talents who have used our resource to cultivate. This process might be long and painful, but we have to face this reality and act bravely.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by David Scherer", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20463", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is the way to go.

In the past century, one of the main reason US become the leading country is it keeps opening to non-immigrant people with high degree of knowledge, especially in STEM. From Albert Einstein to Chen Ning yang, to Sundar Pichai, all of them contributes great to the leading position of US. These years, as more foreign students come to US, studying and working, tons of high technique companies flourish and contributes great to the tax income and welfare of US. In these companies,  STEM students using OPT to get the chance to work in these companies, and provides a lot of ideas, works, and wealth. US also takes the chance to absorb them as the citizens, and fast increase the Sci & Tech abilities of the whole country. Imaging a lot of these people are forced to return to their countries after graduation, can these companies survive? Will US face more competition in the world-wide economy market? US needs high technique people to keep the leading position in the world, and the proposed rule is by all means the best approach.\n\nSome people argue the OPT ruined the welfare of US citizens, and it's a wast of the tax they paid. I have to say, the fact is just in the opposite place. All most all STEM students in their OPT stage, pays as much tax as US citizens, since they are already tax residents. Since a lot of them are working in 'big companies', they may be paying more tax than the average. Regardless to say the progress of their companies increase the welfare of US. Meanwhile, these students built up the links between their hometowns and US, and attracts transnational business creation, trade, and direct investment between US and their country. Finally, NAFSA estimates that during 2013-2014 international students and their families contributed $26.9 billion to the US economy! Without the extended OPT, less students will be attracted to US.\n\nSome people argue the OPT decreased the working opportunities of US citizens. Actually, the STEM OPT brings more working opportunities. As said above, the STEM nonimmingrant students contributes a lot to the leading high-tech companies. All these companies bring up the economy of US and creates more working opportunities by the positions they provide, and the related companies providing service they require. Additionally, the high amount tax they paid to the government help to create more jobs. At present, STEM is flourishing, and more STEM companies only expand the jobs. There are much more STEM students in China than US, but we never heard the job losing rate in China is much larger than US. They actually have much more jobs created every day, especially the STEM positions. That's why they are trying every effort to attract Chinese students in US returning to China.\n\nSome people argue the extension OPT gave more competition of US STEM students, which they don't deserve. Actually, the US STEM students are much easier to find a job than international students, since they don't need the companies to do the immigration documents work and pay for the additional fee. It is because there are less skilled US STEM students than required that companies begin to hire international students. Why? Because the education in elementary schools and middle schools gave more US students a false impression: STEM are difficult, tedious, STEM jobs pays much less than doctors, financial, lawyers. It is the education who should worry about the low ratio of US STEM students, rather than expel nonimmigrant STEM students.\n\nSome people argue that nonimmigrant student ask for lower salary than US students, just want to staying in US, and this ruined the opportunities of US students. This is a open market and legal society. The laws has the lowest salary requirements. All the competition above this is legal. It is meaningless to gain more salary by expelling nonimmigrant students. Actually, if they return after graduate, these companies will open more sub-companies overseas and transfer these opportunities aboard. This is a open market world, competition is worldwide, not only within a nation, especially for those companies able to recruit international students. What's more, as I have said above, the US students actually have higher chances than nonimmigrant students. \n\nIn conclusion, I see no reasons why not approve this rule. It brings benefit not only to nonimmigrant students, but the whole US society and each citizen.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jeff Zhao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15368", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Stem OPT is required for students to concentrate on thier work and they can be able to gain enough knowledge in their course field.

Many negative arguments are based on people's vague imagination, not on facts.

They are absolutely two different things that are governed by two independent processes. Under STEM extension, the employee is still holding a student F-1 visa. That means, OPT extension is only a later part of higher education in STEM fields. It is for EDUCATION, not for employment or residency. On the other hand, US government has a high standard for applications towards permanent residency, and only part of STEM students would be able to meet those standards.\n\nAs I said, STEM extension is for education purpose. Compared with Europe or Japan or any other leading countries in STEM fields, US will remain attractive to excellent international students by providing such a unique benefit. Many students choose America for higher education because of this extra OPT training. Especially, research funding from NSF and NIH is being cut everyday, and scientific research and training in Europe are not worse than US. If there is no OPT or STEM extension, why would students still choose US? Where will be the comparative advantage? Then how long could the American academia remain its leadership in the world with shrinking number of students?\n\nAnd some people are even worrying about OPT students paying less tax? Do you know who pay tax? Citizen and permanent residents. If they are still foreigners or international students, they are not obligated to pay the tax. Actually, what you don't know is that many of these international students who are on OPT are PAYING the tax just like permanent residents do.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nEmployers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign OPT students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program.

America workers pay the taxes that support our government.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for re instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe proposal to re institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\nEstablishing goals and a professional road map at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished.

We should help OUR own students first.  \n\nSome will say \"Well, we (U.S.taxpayers) pay for the foreign students' education already - we have an investment there.\" (It's true that we fund their educations - they do not pay their own way), but two wrongs don't make a right.  In years gone by the foreign student came, acquired his education and skill and then, returned home to make his own country a better place. The developing world needs all the doctors, engineers and scientists it can get.  We are causing a brain drain thru OPT & H-1B.  Unfortunately, the foreign students are far more interested it getting 100k American salaries than in helping the people back in their home countries.\n\nWe should definitely discontinue the OPT program which is in place because American corporations want to pay lower salaries for graduate degrees than the marketplace currently allows.

And, I'm also an international student majored in Engineering.\n\nReasons for me to support this policy are not only because this policy benefit the international students, but also the whole American Society could be profited. \n\nFirst of all, the STEM policy attracting more international students choosing study in USA other than the other countries. Students like me, who're from mid-class of developing countries, choose carefully which country to study in cause study aboard would cost great fortune of their family. Some of my friends choose study in England, becasue they have shorter learning period. And they could save money through this education system. While the others choose the American cause we got this great opportunity to practice our skills learned. It is the OPT and its extension policy makes international students choose the US rather than the other country. And the tuition fee we give are proved to contribute at least 1433 billion USD in 2008, and keeps increasing afterwards. \n\nSecond, STEM students need chances to practice their skills through real work. My colleagues who majored in Engineering usually interning in their field for a few months before they get a full time job. 12 months period is too short for STEM students to fully practice what they learnt in school. And students who graduated in spring are even hard to get a full time job within 4 months, to at least get one chance applying for H1b. The talents may lose their opportunity contributing to American ecomoic then.\n\nThird, though more and more students could work in the US during 17 months of opt extension, without increasing the H1b quota, they won't able to immigrate to US anyway. I bring this point up cause many dissenting opinions are from people who afraid the international students will take their work chances. And I would like to say this is only imaginary fears. The only way for the international students to stay for long in the US is getting an H1b Visa. With the limited H1b quota, the international students won't be able to robbery anything from the American.\n\nFinally, more international students working in the same company could make it diverse and competitive. This policy is not aiming at bringing more immigration to the US, but giving students a chance to practice. Students get chances to be trained and also their colleagues get chances to learning about the rest of the world as well as some new thoughts that would benefit their career. It is the diverse culture backgrounds that bringing different thoughts. opinions and views and all together making the US the strongest country in the world.\n\nI took half an hour writing this comment, showing my opinions on this regulation, because I believe this is a lovely and lively country that always welcome talented and hard working people form every race, region and socioeconomic bracket. And I truly hope those who work hard could arrive in their field with the help of this policy. Also, it is pleasent to see this policy attracting and increasing number of international students study in the US, and contributing a better country, making US the best country that I've every been.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLuti Zhang", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Luti Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14343", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "that is just bringing in more isis muslim terriorists sneaking them in anyway they can WAKE UP AMERICA", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Doug Lucas (2nd Comment)", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8256", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I really support this rule because of several reasons.

We can find that in a variety of fields, like engineering, computer science, architecture and mathematics. Do they need any talented and practical people from all over the world to work on? The answer must be yes. If so, I can't find any reasons to remove this  policy from the document.\n\nSome people might say, it is because there are a large number of international student working in USA, this will cause a high competition in USA's labor market, and it even makes the local people really hard to get a job in USA. I just want to ask, is it really the true? You can't find a job, and you go to blame on the international people, but not yourself? \n\nThink about it, if you kick out all the competitive and superior people just because they are from oversea, and you keep using all of your less productive local people. What will happen in USA? How can you meet your country's high demand for the intelligent people? How can you keep your country's such fast development? and how can you still keep your country being the world's biggest IT industry?\n\nI do not only care about whether we international student can have more time working in here, but I really think that it is not appropriate to ask them all to get out of this country suddenly. If you don't give them chance to stay here and work here. How many of them will still want to come here for studying or working? If you lose a large number of international students, will you also lose a lot of income from them? At the same time, will you lose a lot of talented worker and a lot of investors from international?\n\nAbove all, I just want to beg you guys to consider it very very carefully, to do a favor for us, and do a favor for yourself.

The U.S. is faced up with stronger and stronger competitions from other countries like China, Russia, India and so on. China \ncan develop so fast nowadays due to its adequate human resource, not only in manufacture but also in STEM related fields. \nPeople have realized the importance of STEM related jobs in the development of one country, especially for the U.S., and these\n fields have a large demand for human resource nowadays. Therefore, we should extend the OPT for F1 students in order to \nmaintain an enough pool of human resource, which can help the U.S. remain competitive in the future.\n\n2. As I know, many students majoring in STEM fields are international students, coming from India, China and so on. Current \n12 months OPT period is too short for these students to even get familiar with what they need to do in their companies. \nExtending the OPT period to 24 months will help them and their employers get more familiar with each other.\n\n3. As I know, most of the international students studying in the U.S. are very talented and creative people in their homeland,\n like the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai. Their talents are treasury for the U.S. Their homeland spends about 20 years to \neducate them, but they can contribute for the U.S. immediately. What a bargain, right? And those international students \nwho wish to develop their careers after graduation are willing to become a part of the country, most of which respect and \nvalue what Americans care, like freedom, justice, otherwise they will not choose to stay here.\n\nTo draw a conclusion, in order to assure the long-term competiveness of the U.S., we should attract more talented people \naround the world to work here.

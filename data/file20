F1 students are admitted by the admission office at Universities so the vast majority of them have the skills and they are the talented people.

Their staying in the U.S. actually helps to generate more job opportunities that could address the employment problem (increase the employment rate).\n\n2.The US welcomes the students from all over the world. If the US doesn't welcome them to stay here for a period of time, it just doesn't make any sense. If the US only welcomes someone that sends the money to the US and doesn't allow anyone that hopes to make some money after graduation, it is really impolite and unreasonable.

One may argue that the international students may occupy too many openings that are supposed to be fitted by domestic students. Please note that, many people share a huge cake is much better than few people share a tiny cake, because if the company is no longer on the top in the field, other companies (for example Baidu, Huawei) will take most of the cake!\n\n(2.)

If STEM extension did not pass, it hurts United States high-tech industry more than it hurts international students. Companies like Google and Apple could only became the leader of world technology because they could hire talented international employees. If this proposal got declined, high-tech companies will potentially lose hundreds of thousands qualified workers and those worker will be working for the competitors of US companies and can potentially cause billions of dollars of economic decline for the US high-tech industry.\n2. International students are not directly against domestic workers. It might seems that employment opportunities were being taken by international workers, but please do note that high-tech industry never stops hiring. Most high-tech companies will be happy to hire as much qualified candidates as they can regardless that candidate is domestic worker or not. It is worth noting that the majority of STEM extension students ends up working for the high-tech industry where job opportunities are always open.\n3. Kicking talented international workers out of the country makes no economical sense. Most of the high-tech companies, for example, Google, Facebook, have offices in Canada or Europe in order to keep employees who can not work inside the United States. Declining the STEM extension proposal does not stops companies from hiring foreign workers at all and all it does is to send those people overseas, paying their taxes and spend their money in another country that is not United States. It will hurts the US economy in the long term.\n4. Foreign workers are creating much more job opportunities than ever. As we all know, F-1 students can only work in \"highly specialized areas\" that is directly related to their field of study. For STEM students, they tends to be very advanced positions that creates much more economical opportunities than most other occupations. This have created countless job opportunities inside the United States and will be completely gone if those workers can not even work in the US anymore.\n5. I did noticed people complaining companies hiring \"cheap foreign workers\" and \"fired domestic workers afterwards. \" To what I can tell, most of the high-tech companies pays foreign workers just as much as domestic workers since their salary system is very well established. I haven't heard any particular companies trying to do that. If you were fired because your company hired some \"cheap international workers, \" I believe it is directly against current federal laws and you can report the name of the company to federal government and they will pay the price for it.\n\nAs I mentioned, STEM extension helps US economy and creates enormous job openings domestically.

True, in the shorter term there are layoffs and the associated misery. but history has proven otherwise.\n\nThe new guideline for Companies to match the pay of students in STEM extension has as much to do with equality as is to do with protecting American jobs.

My stand point is based on both my observation and study of this matter. \nFirst off, I would like to emphasize an important reason that this extension is necessary for STEM students which is neglected by the most. STEM jobs are different from jobs in other sector due to its nature. Its common to have long term projects for engineers in STEM sectors. For example, business software development often take at least one year to several years to finish. A young professional with only one year limit can hardly take part in such projects, in which case employers would be hesitated to hire them.\nAlso, the extension made American STEM education competitive compared to other countries. In America, 40% percent of Chinese student and 74% of Indian students are in STEM majors, while this number for Chinese students in UK is less than 20%, where business majors are the most popular. Its the friendly environment of US for STEM students makes it the most attractive place for young talents in engineering. If measures like STEM extension are revoked, I believe US will be much less appealing for overseas STEM students who will inevitably incline more to other advanced countries like Canada or Australia.\nIts also important for American technology industry to have high level professionals in STEM sectors. It is well and long known that the number of American students who prefer STEM is diminishing. According to National Center for Education statistics, of the 1,791,000 bachelors degrees conferred in 201112, the greatest numbers of degrees were conferred in the fields of business, social sciences and history. It is an established fact that IT department and other STEM fields are facing a major shortage in human resource. Some people may hold an idea that there is even a surplus of STEM student, but based on my observation that its still easy for STEM foreign students to find a job in US, despite of many restrictions and disadvantages of being non-citizens. This clearly indicate that the need for worker in IT and other High-tech sector is great, without supply of foreign engineers, such sectors will no doubt suffer from loss of valuable professionals.\nI read others comment and noticed a claim saying that OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; This seems to be astonishing so I did research on this claim and finally found the source from the website of CIS, an organization claims to be non-partisan on immigration studies. To my surprise, the article simply add up number of foreign students who benefited from opt program in all majors during the years then jump to this conclusion. Even though total number of OPT students is immaterial to the proposal which is only related to STEM students, we can still notice the author's radical view point, which is nothing new but claiming that US doesnt need any foreign work force to meet its domestic need. If this is true and ethical, there is no point for us to talk about opt extension, because work visa and other permit for foreigner workers to stay in US like OPT should never exist in the first place. As a result, I find this claim to be nothing but pointless.\nThere is also a notion that foreign students are not paying Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which gives them advantages over American workers. First, this claim wrongly assumes that everyone who work in US should pay such fees without regard to their situation. This is absurd because why on earth should OPT students pay for their retirement considering they will leave US in the future. Second, people who say foreign students are cheaper clearly have no idea of the money a High-Tech worker can earn. How much does 200 dollars matter if the employer needs to pay 10K per year for a young talent? For companies who pay a lot of money on valuable work force, their priority is to keep them, not to find a way to under pay them, because there are always places for them to go. People who made such claims either have little knowledge  of High-tech factor or are biased in the first place.\nTo sum up, STEM OPT extension is beneficial to both STEM students and US. The opposing opinions are based on false ideas and thus shouldnt be accepted.\n\n \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Meng Tian", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20364", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am opposed to this rule(s).

It is beneficial not only to US corporations, US education industry, US citizens but also to foreign students and their original countries.\nThe extension is essential to many US corporations. As a business analyst currently working in a US corporation after graduation, I took responsibility in conducting a three-year long term project. Without the extension program, the company will need to hire new employees and spent time, and of course money, in training them, which will incur huge cost from a business perspective. Some of the research programs also require more than three years of devotion, which is based on the assumption that the researcher is able to be aligned to the program for at least two to three years.\nNot only will US corporations be negatively affected but also the education industry. The colleges and graduate schools which offer science and technology programs became attractive partially because of the STEM extension. Without the extension program, some of the students may no longer consider these programs as their first choices because only one year's working experience in US is far from enough to get acknowledged in certain industry, thus other countries which offer similar program with lower cost may become equally or more attractive.\nWith STEM programs not supported by extension, more foreign students will start to pursue business or other non-technical programs, which will affect the US citizens' competitiveness in these areas. Some of the US citizens fighting against extension state that through extension they are losing jobs in specific STEM fields while they ignore the fact they are losing positions because they lack specific skillsets instead of extension program. To my perspective, the extension program cannot be fairer for the minority foreign students with higher level of education and diligence. \nLast but not least, the extension offers longer time for graduates to become fully-fledged in certain industry, which will benefit the students themselves and the original country.

This action will benefit those student who has the desired skills/knowledge working for qualified companies in STEM field. I reviewed some comments which are against this extension, and their arguments do not make sense.\n\n1. OPT and OPT extension do NOT reduce the job opportunities available to native American students. For hiring a new graduate student from college (entry level), a company pays same salary no matter if the student is American or foreign student (otherwise it violates law). Then why a company is still willing to hire a student on OPT? Because the number of American students in STEM fields cannot meet the demand of job market. Some comments complain about they had been denied for a job because of students on OPT, they should think more about their own interview skills (the job position could be taken by another American), rather than blaming students on OPT, which is unfair.\n\nFurther more on this, not all companies are qualified to hire student on OPT extensions, only a small set of companies are capable of hiring them (e-verified company). There are plenty of jobs only available to American STEM students, those people who claim students on OPT take American STEM students should be aware of this.\n\n2. OPT and OPT extension do NOT reduce the money in Social Security or medicare trust funds. Students on OPT are NOT illegal immigrants, they pay tax and medicare as normal Americans. This country can even tolerate illegal immigrants, why not legal students who pay tax? As U. S. is a country built up by immigrants, people with proper skills and knowledge should be allowed to stay and make contribution to this country. Student on OPT work as hard as they can to gain such an opportunity to stay in this country without touching native American's right, why accuse them for these untrue claims?\n\nIn addition to previous arguments, if OPT is cancelled, more job positions will be sent to other country like India or China (like in IT industry). In this case, much money in Social Security or medicare is lost indeed.\n\n\nMany people in their reviews complains about they cannot find a job because of OPT program or even H1B program. Personally I understand finding job is not a easy process and one may get desperate on this, however hiring a person from a lot of candidates based on a lot of factors, simply blaming OPT/H1B program because of you not getting a job is unfair. There is no logical relation between American STEM not land a job and the OPT extension program. OPT and its extension actually benefit this country and make U. S. more competitive in the STEM fields, thousands of people has taken the benefit from this program and make contribution to U.S..

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and, will graduate in Dec 2015 with a masters of science  degree in the field of Computer Science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nGaurav Dokania", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gaurav Dokania", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9941", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally support this rule.\nMany people says that extent OPT will allow international students compete with American people for limited job and employer prefer to hire these international students because they are cheaper.

And here is what makes me drive the decision:\n\n1. International student under OPT STEM extension are highly skilled people and we need to keep these kind of people, as long as possible. Science, technology, engineering and math highly reflects the strength of the country and students under OPT STEM extension are targeted to help specifically those areas. They are not low paid worked and they can yell high profit for their company and the nation. With more time added to the OPT extension we will have a better chance to find the people that are needed by the industry by the country and by the culture.\n\n2. STEM areas need more skilled people and this proposed rule will help to keep more of them in. STEM areas created a large portion of the growth of the U.S. and STEM areas are among the fastest developing areas which means more talented engineers and scientists are needed. Since we don't have enough human resource to keep the pace of the industry we need to, of course, attract those skilled people across the globe. And this rule will surely help that. This rule will only help those students that can maintain a legal job in the related areas and this means they are, to some extent, already accepted by the company and the industry and that also means they are filling the gap and we need them.\n\n3. I have seen some comments talking about this rule will affect the job market negatively but I can't agree with them. I agree just the fact that it will affect the job market. But NOT negatively. Competition does exists but it helps the Americans to keep the pace with the world. Keeping a rule to limit highly skilled worker from other countries will also mean that we are not confident about the U.S.'s constantly improving education level. Allowing certain level of competition will help Americans to continuously enlarge their skill set instead of doing nothing but hoping the government will keep those competitive people out of the country.\n\n4. Adding more time to OPT extension will benefit those students, their family and their country. With this rule students will have more time in their OPT extension to help them make a better decision over continuing their education or starting their career. Student will also gain more career experience which will help their own development and their countries as well.\n\nOverall, the proposed rule is very a smart decision which will create a win-win situation for all the parties.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qin Shen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16389", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please make it easier for them to extend their visas after they graduate so that they can stay and work in the U.S under the Optional Practical Training Program (OPT).", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chetan Borole", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9549", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a restaurant holder living in Pittsburgh.

I have been actively looking for any training opportunities while I'm an undergraduate student. I went to all the Career Fairs in the past five years and I can tell you how many times I was rejected by companies, not because of my academic performance, my professional skills, my conversational skills etc., all I heard was \"sorry, we DO NOT hire international student\". This sentence has been embedded in my mind for long time, because every time before I want to start a conversation with any person in the Career Fair, they already labeled me as a \"not-to-be-considered candidate\". From what I observed, the companies specially the big ones such as General Electric, Siemens, IBM etc. are doing a pretty good job on securing their jobs for local people. I do understand their situations and concerns, but whenever I look back, one of the reason that attracted me to come study in US was the equity and respect people can receive here. In fact, I was expecting more opportunities rather than coldly rejected by the professionals who did not even try to know me or give me a chance to talk with. I was under depression over those times, and kept doubting myself and losing my confidence until I heard from my peers who are undergoing the exact same situation as mine. From time to time, I kept seeing lots of talented and outstanding students being turned down by various opportunities because of their identities as an international student (F1). I truly feel upset and being treated unfair. \n\n<3> To give you more specific details, I'm a top 5% student in my college as well as leader of 3 student organizations. I dedicated myself to volunteer or do community service more than 20 hours each year. When it comes to opportunities, I sent out about 400 resumes on average each year and only have 5 interviews lined up normally. Yes, this is the reality - the companies filter me out in their systems because of my F1 identify and, filter again during interviews. Regardless of how poor the support is out there for international student, I don't think OPT Extension will affect job opportunities for local people as we actually do not have as many opportunities as one would think we have and companies today follow the rules of \"using a foreign worker only if they are not capable of finding a local worker to match the job\". \n\n<4> In addition, the existence of OPT Extension is to ensure that the US remains competitive globally. I studied with my American friends all the time, and it was quite obvious that science, technology and engineering subjects seemed to be harder for them. A lot of times I felt so easy to complete my calculus homework because I learnt that at my 9th grade, but none of my American friends they did. I was happy to help them with these subjects, and in the meantime I realized how different the education we received before college. If US wants to remain competitive, the key point is to improve its education which will help the students to remain competitive in the job market. I found it unbelievable that some people thought if the OPT extension is cancelled, they would gain or retrieve more jobs. This appears to me is to shutting the door to the globe and not facing the truth how fast other countries are growing. This is no way close to a solution of securing jobs for local people. Instead of focusing on how to limit the amount of F1 students on OPT Extension or how to restrict the time they could stay here on OPT, considerations and actions should be taken to develop a better way of encouraging the local STEM students. To give you some facts, upon graduation, the average GPA of all engineering students in my school is 2.8 while the average GPA of engineering students who are international students (F1) is 3.2. I see that F1 students bring in competition but I also believe this competition will help the local students to improve their technical capabilities, global acumen, whole leadership and etc.\n\n<5> Overall, I disagree that OPT Extension damages the job opportunities for local people and I encourage the healthy competition between F1 students and local students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yi Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15170", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly approve this policy!\n\nWithout OPT extension, I definitely will not spend so much money on taking education in the US.

Make sure the new rule comes into effect from Feb 15th 2016.Otherwise employers will be pissed off, when the student on F1-visa says he/she can't work for few months. The project in the organization has deadlines and resources are expected to complete their tasks on time.\nHence I strongly request DHS to fix this rule and make it effective on time, so that employers and as well as employees are not impacted.\n2. Increase the OPT period to 36 months. Then only it will give enough time for students to learn things on the job training.24 months is not sufficient because of the high competition for H1B visa's(Obviously employer will not be willing to lose the resource, since organization has spent lot of time & money in training the person). So employers want to make use of the trained and skilled resource and if 36 months is given, then both parties will have enough time to get H1B from this heavy competitive lottery.\nNext:\nPeople working on OPT doesn't come cheaply for organizations. Employers advertise for job positions and since they are not able to find Native American's with those skills, they go for international students with the cost of sponsoring them visas. So my point is, international students are not pulling the jobs of American's by working for fewer wage.(Average American Indian house hold income is 90K and the average American income is 40K). This tells immigrants don't get jobs because they are cheap, but they get jobs since they are needed.\nOn an average international student spends 1 year on writing GRE, TOFEL, Appling for universities, getting visa and on top of that paying extra fee to study. He/she works hard on an average of 3 years to complete their education and at the end most of the campus placement companies says; sorry we are not hiring people, who need sponsorship. Then people start applying; through job portals and end up getting one call for every 100 job applications. This employer conducts 3 to 4 rounds of interview and finally selects the student, because they were not able to find anyone from market. All of a sudden, some tech organization sues the rules made by agencies and employers are frustrated with hiring international students because of immigration policies.\nSo employers loose talent people and loose the competitive edge over their competitors who have MNC companies. When there is no competition, you get trash not cream. America imports oil from Saudi Arabia, Cars from Japan, TV's from Korea, whisky from Scotland, smart brains from India. So immigrants are not doing harm to citizens of America, they are helping to create jobs, improve the economy of the country, filling the needs of the country by sacrificing the livelihood with their families back in their own countries.\nSo I humbly request DHS to implement this new rule by Feb 15th 2016 and provide the stem opt for 36 months.

The success of academic institutions contribute to the US economy and culture in varies ways.\nThis extension proposal can attract more excellent international students, and bring benefits to the US for the following reasons:\n\n1. The STEM students are the main work force in research. \nAs a former researcher in a top university in mid-west, I can tell in the field of Science, Engineering and Technology, a majority of productive researchers are STEM international graduate students. Their solid knowledge, critical thinking, analysis skills, as well as the hard working attitude, contribute significantly to the academic prosperity. Their excellence is not a surprise because they are the top students from their own countries, hence much more productive than average local American students.\n\n2. Our educational institutions need STEM students to help improve the education quality.\nThe STEM students are the main part of teaching assistants in universities. Without these STEM students, the schools may face much more difficulties than now, to conduct educational activities.\n\n3. STEM students help to create great learning atmosphere.\nDue the reason mentioned above, that they are from the top students in their own country, these STEM student help to form an environment that promote everyone to pursue knowledge, and work hard, which lays a positive foundation for the whole society in the long term.\n\nIn the end, the STEM students are great advantages for research and educational institutions.

Students like me have decided to pursue their higher studies in the united states not just because of the high quality of education here but also because of the high standard of work expected from an employee. Getting that opportunity to work for an employer and to be able to put the skills acquired in my education in the practical work sphere is  something which is Beneficial not just to the students but also to the employer to expand their talent base and diversity in the work environment. \n\nHowever in the recent times a lot of U.S employers have shown reluctance towards hiring  F1 student simply because of the work regulations that they have and are looking more inclined towards hiring people with H1 visas. It is in this context that i would like to suggest that the wording pertaining to the proposed mentoring and training program be  the proposed rule be looked into and maybe come up with a wording which doesn't sound negative for the employers. The current wording suggest additional work for an employer and doesn't necessarily inspire confidence for the employers to look out for the talent base from F1 students. A really useful and capable student can miss out on the opportunity to contribute towards his own growth and probably working towards making the organization better since the employer feels that it is too much a hassle in the hiring and development of a F1 student with no guarantee of a work visa such as H1 guaranteed. \n\nAn employer hiring usually looks at a candidate from a long term perspective and expects results from the candidate. But the current wording indicates more towards an employer having to use their other resources towards a F1 Student without any assurance of returns in the long term. This might cause the employers to be reluctant to hire Graduates which would effectively defeat the purpose of this rule. If employers are not encouraged towards hiring F1 students the whole rule would be obsolete no matter if it 17 months or 24 months.\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dinesh Mandadi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2404", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is definitely a good proposal.

The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned.Today it is used by foreign students stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. \n\nEmployers don't need incentive to hire from this huge amount of workers since they are younger (cheaper) and they don't have to pay FICA or MEDICARE taxes, saving employers 7.65 percent. This, then takes away jobs that should go to American STEM workers and costs Social Security 1 billion, yes that's  $1,000,000,000 dollars a year.\n\nThe GAO found the program full of inconsistencies and not adequately overseen by the department. The report found a major national security problem in that ICE cannot insure that foreign students are maintaining their legal status in the US.\n\nIF THE US NEEDS FOREIGN STUDENTS TO REMEDY A STEM LABOR SHORTAGE : WHY DO THESE STUDENTS NEED TRAINING???\n\nDHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\n\nLike other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class. Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money. Something is terribly wrong here.\n\nNot only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. What is going on here???\n\nThe way the regulation that is to safeguard US workers reads: \"similarly situated U.S. workers would include U.S. workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the STEM OPT student.\"  By Definition There Are No Similarly Situated U.S.Workers Ensuring That No One Will Meet This Definition So The Employer Can Never Be Liable For Replacing Any U.S. Worker since there are no similarly situated US workers.\n\nThe Regulation does not care if the student is taught anything at all because the Regulation leaves it to the UNTRAINED employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for STEM OPT students. The Regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the cheaper imported foreign student.\n\nIf the DHS cared to protect the U.S. worker, then, the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. EMPLOYEE.\n\nDHS should/must conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet BOTH the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S.workers is in any way adversely impacted. Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the PAST FIVE (5) YEARS WITH NAMES, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS.\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud. THIS VISA PROGRAM, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, ALLOWS FOREIGN STUDENTS TO SPY ON THE US GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND EMPLOYERS.The FBI has publicly stated that there are SO MANY FOREIGN STUDENT SPIES  that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.\n\nOf course, the message form this Regulation is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9342", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please stop the madness!

I did not plan to work here at first and the reason I came here is to take care of my husband, so he could do better on his own study. However, I found that Americans love learning new stuff and always talked about starting a dream is never too late after I lived here for three years. Besides, many of my American friends encouraged me to apply for a new master degree and tried to find a job in America after. Therefore, I did apply for a master program and got admission.\n\nI got to say, I love the university here. The professors are very nice and I learned a lot of professional skills and other fun stuff about American culture. I truly believe what I have learned is going to make America and Americans better in the future, not in a very huge way, but definitely make this country better.\n\nSo I think the extension of OPT to 24 months or even longer is necessary and the best thing for America, which is a great way for America attracting more professionals to stay here.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n \nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qiuping Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15640", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Before doing anything else please give correct guidelines or regulations for DUAL INTENT for f-1 visa\napplicants and holders.\n\nRefusing of f-1 visa on premise that a candidate could take up a job in US in future, while allowing those already in US\nto take up jobs under OPT and extending them privilege for another 2 years and stop gap and h-1 filing is a \nSELF CONTRADICTORY action.

Will this program improve the unemployment rate of their home country more than it will negatively impact ours? ...I wonder.\nAllowing limited foreign exchange student study programs can benefit us all, if done intelligently. Work programs not so much. The OPT program should be scaled way back- not expanded. Allowing and encouraging foreign STEM students or otherwise, to take domestic jobs only benefits one side of the equation. Having a well educated society, most especially in third world countries, will accelerate their domestic and international progress. Encouraging these well educated graduates not to return to their own countries seems unnecessarily selfish on our part, since we are leaving so many of our own highly qualified graduates unprioritized and unsubsidized. The whole idea of this program seems to be that we don't generate enough qualified STEM graduates. I beg to differ. We do and anyone who declares otherwise just isn't looking. This program smells of big tech looking to import cheap foreign labor at taxpayer expense. The more serious damage is to our youth who will be disadvantaged and left without opportunity. This is all about subsidizing cheap foreign labor and it shouldn't be.   \nThere is a problem here, and it is one that we have created. We are talking about STEM graduates who have been allocated certain percentages of spots at our undergraduate and graduate institutions, who have been educated right along side our own students. Are they smarter than our students? I think not. They are more attractive to big industry for three reasons. The first big incentive for the OPT program participant is that this program gives them a chance not to return to their home country and to have an opportunity to become a US citizen (not so good for their home country). The second big incentive for big industry is that these OPT participants may allow companies that hire them to be federally subsidized. The third big incentive is that these subsidized employees can be offered and will accept lower pay because of the first two incentives. Why would a for profit company hire a domestic graduate without these same incentives?  \nWhat frightens me the most is that the problem creators may be allowed to make it worse.

The Optional Practical Training (OPT) program has numerous problems:\n\n(1) OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013;\n(2) OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds;\n(3) The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program;\n(4) There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers;\n(5) OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year;\n(6) This program poses a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country.

I fully support the policy.\n\nCaglar Ozden, a lead economist in the World Bank's Development Research Group published a research in march 2015, which states that immigrants actually bring more benefits, especially for the developed country as United States, after years' of research. He found that people consider immigration the most important challenge their countries currently face and blame migrants for dealing wages and high unemployment, but through research, it shows that the wage impact of immigration is clearly minimal (only 0.6% for U.S. natives during 1990-2006). \n\nImmigrants also create lots of jobs in the U.S. According to Caglar, Ozden, the public perception of the job-killing effects of migration is strong because job losses are visible to all, especially to those directly affected. Job-creating effects are less transparent so that the U.S. citizens couldn't see the immigrants' contribution to the job market. The STEM immigrants contributed a lot to the technology development of the U.S., lead to the increase of economic growth and prosperity, which will inspire firms to expand and hire more workers. In this way, thousands of jobs are created in the market. \n\nIn addition, most of the immigrants in the U.S. are well educated and high skilled. The data shows that the immigrants in the United States are more educated and account for 70 percent of tertiary educated migrants in OECD countries ). The research also finds that there are the occupations in which native workers seem to be in short supply. For example, the U.S. are in urgent need of more engineers. The immigrants in STEM fields are contributing a lot to the technological development of the U.S. For instance, big high-tech firms such as Google and Amazon benefit a lot from the foreign labor force. Immigrants indeed complement the U.S. labor market and native workers' skills. \n\nLast but not the least, the STEM foreign workers also push natives toward more complex tasks because the natives will feel competitiveness and work harder. This job upgrading is critical for productivity and income growth and is more prevalent in countries with more flexible labor laws. \n\nAs a result, the policy is a fantastic policy and will definitely be beneficial for both the U.S. citizens and STEM immigrants.

Considering that a large portion of STEM students will abandon their future plan to study in U.S.  That is a huge impact on the current U.S education ecosystem that has already adapted to wide internationalization.  \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Amy CHEN", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13827", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the STEM OPT Extension for the following reasons:\n\n1. If this proposal is not approved, U.S could lose up to 350,000 (There are about 1 million international students enrolled in U.S colleges, 35% are pursuing degree in STEM majors) high-skilled workers in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math within the next 4 years. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple heavily recruit STEM major students every year. However, the supply of domestic STEM students is far less than the high recruiting demand. Therefore, these companies would be severely impacted if they can't fulfill its headcount by hiring international students in STEM major. On the other hand, these high-skilled talents would flow to countries such as Europe, China and India. U.S. would thus lose its competitive edge to its competitors due to huge loss of talents.\n\n2. STEM major international students do not threat U.S workers' job security. As previously stated, STEM international students are fulfilling the gap between the huge demands for STEM students and the low supply of domestic STEM students. If U.S companies couldn't hire enough workers, they would have to outsource the work to other countries, which helps boom the economy and contributes tax revenue to other countries instead of U.S.\n\nBased on the above points, I strongly recommend to allow international students with STEM major to have an extension of 24 months practical training. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zoey Fan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22163", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a great rule for OPT extension.\n\nThis gives people opportunity to further enhance their skills in the industry related to the knowledge they obtained from U.S colleges.

The reality is that many companies are seeking good engineering resources but restrained by the fact that international students have to be sponsored in short period of time for applying H1B visa and this costs.

I did not feel like the technical questions during my job interviews were too challenging for me; however, I still could not quite imagine what I would be doing on a daily basis simply from the job descriptions. Now I have been working in a technical consulting firm for more than two years, and finally feel that I'm on track. I have interacted with clients from many different industries, and could see how the world works as a integrated complicated system. Now I can better understand the what my job is able to offer to the society, as well as the importance of how I perform. As a technical consultant, it makes a big difference when integrity plays a role. This helps to enhance the relationship between the clients and government agencies, which usually means that public welfare is protected in the first place.\n\nFrom what I see, the real-life on-job training is the only way for students who just finished school to understand and learn how the world works. Internship is also a type of on-job training; however, what could be learnt from internship is somewhat limited due to the short time span. Additionally, most of the companies would define \"entry-level\" as with minimum of two years of related experience. To understand the big-picture of an industry, it would at least take two years on the job. Therefore, I see that OPT program with extension period that cover more than two years will definitely help new graduates to gain the valuable on-job training and enhance the understanding of the industry.\n\nMoreover, integrity means more than \"doing the right thing\" when it comes to real-life circumstances. It is much more challenging than giving the correct answer to engineering ethic problems at school. In real-life, making the right choice is often affected by many factors, such as financial interests, reputation etc. How to ensure integrity plays an important role in decision making is something that could only be learnt from the on-job training. \n\nMost of the F-1 students come from the countries that have very different cultural and social background than the U.S. As a world leader on technology and various industries, the U.S. is able to provide the valuable experience for the F-1 students through on-job training. Students who gained the valuable working experience are also valuable assets to the U.S., through their great performance in providing various types of service.\n\nIn conclusion, I benefited a lot from the OPT program with the extension period and I'm very sure that this proposed rule will continue to benefit many more F-1 students like me.

By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\n2.  The proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\n3. The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\n4. After the GAO issued its report in 2014, you were urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. You were also asked to ensure that the Department move swiftly to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. \n5. OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\n\nI would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bruce Aiello", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4352", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This OPT STEM Degree extension is beneficial  to both American citizens and F1 Students.\n\nAmerican is a multi-culture Country and welcome people from all over the world.\n\nStudents are coming to learn the advanced technology and culture in The US.

I'm an international Electrical Engineering master student and is an intern. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. It is like treating to those who are attracted by the OPT extension policy. For me, I would not come to US if there is no OPT extension. If terminated, it is treating to me. If so, I cannot believe US government any more. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nBesides, I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more.

The OPT program should go back to the 12 month period or at most stay at 17 months and not be increased.  Part of the qualification for a foreign STEM student should be his/her country of origin.  Any student from a country that is already advanced in the technology industry should not be considered.\n\nThank You  ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Richard Potts", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3768", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a student majoring in statistics, one reason I chose US instead of Canada for education is because of the OPT STEM, which allows me to work for more than 1 year, gaining more practical work experience.

We are providing the best higher education to the best students all over the world. It does not make any sense if we just let them leave the US, return to their original country, and contribute with all they've learned in the US. Why the US is the strongest country in the world? Because we have the best people - the best scientists, the best engineers, the  most advanced technologies. A large part of the most successful figures in science and industry in the US are originally international students. They received the best education, and then start to contribute to this country, using the OPT and OPT STEM extension opportunities. Without these wonderful opportunities, they would have returned to their own country, start their business, lead their research, serve for their military forces, and help their own country to surpass the US.\n\nAnd also China government is planning so many attractive policies to make overseas students come back to China and extremely encourage them to learn advanced technologies from US and contribute to home country. Why?!Because this is the age of striving for talents!!\n\nSome people hold the narrow and one-sided opinion that international students are seizing the job opportunities of US native workers. This is very short-sighted, and just, rediculous and selfish. Most of the international students who need OPT STEM extension receive the highest education in the US, and they are seeking opportunities like engineers and scientists. Are we having too many engineers and scientists in the US? No!!! We have too few of them. China, India, Russia and Brazil are spending a huge amount of money to attrack the best scientists and engineers to go to their countries; and we, the US, are thinking of expelling them because they are seizing job opportunities of local workers? How many of our local workers are qualified for the top-level scientists and engineers positions that require years of master or even doctoral level training? I don't know the exact number, but I believe 0.01% might be an over-estimate. From my opinion only weak people are afraid of competing and worrying about other outstanding people will take the jobs from them !!\n\nActually capable foreigners are really needed and important because of the Catfish Effect !!! If there is no competition, the natives will get lazy and cozy! Is it helpful for the future development of United states???\n\nBesides,in the long run , we strongly believe that the OPT STEM extension opportunity will create more job opportunities for our local people. Many of the international students are seeking for scientists and engineering positions, and they need the opportunity to gain working experience in the US. But mostly they are not going to always stay in these companies. They want to start their own business in the US, and hire local people. No one doubts that the United States is the best place to start your business, and now is the best time, than ever. Many of our most impactful and successful companies are originally start-up companies, and many of them are started by international students. Do you know Nvidia, the largest manufacture of graphics processing units  in the world? It is founded by a Taiwanese, named Jen-Hsun Huang. If he did not have the opportunity to work in the US, there would be no Nvidia, thus no general purpose GPU, no advancement in deep learning - a revolutionary achievement in artificial intelligence, no modern video games with lavish visual effects but still running smoothly on your laptop, and our supercomputers would be hundreds of thousand times slower than what we actually have now. \n\nIn summmary, we should definitely support the improving and expanding of the training opportunities of international students. It is about the destiny of the country that we all love - the United States. Let's do not be short-sighted and allured by some dangerous immediate \"benefit\". If you really care about the future of our country, care about the future competence with all other talents from all over the world of your children, you should support the OPT STEM extension.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sulora Feng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20765", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The Department of Homeland Securitys proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program is good for all american.

Having longer OPT time means having more practical working experience which is good for a student to pursue his/her career. \n\nThis is good for our foreign students, but I have to point out that foreign students is not the only party that benefits from this rule. Extending OPT time can enable more fresh graduates with sharp skill to work for US companies for a longer time, making increasing contributions to science, technology and economy of USA. Also, when those students finish their OPT, their will go back to their home countries with cutting-edge experience and make contribution to their home countries. Expanding OPT can have a global benefit. \n\n\nHowever, many citizens are more concerned about the potential negative impact on the labor market. Someone complains that some employer are more likely to hire foreign OPT students than citizens since OPT students are paid lower, and draws the conclusion that OPT should be cancelled. This fact is disturbing but this could not be the reason for opposing OPT. \n\nThere is actually a misunderstanding of the OPT program. The OPT program is intended for attracting more qualified foreign students to work for US companies. It is not for helping IT companies to reduce their expense. It is those companies who is abusing the rule. There is not a single regulation in OPT program that encourages a company to pay lower for OPT employees. On the contrary, there ARE many rules intended for ensuring OPT employees are fairly paid in this OPT proposal in order to fix the problem. \n\nIt is not fair to deny the whole program with such benefits just because it has some loophole. What we really need to do is to urge the government to set up more effective rules to guarantee that OPT employees are fairly paid, which is good for both foreign students and citizen workers. \n\n\nAlso, there is a sound that blames unemployment on foreigners squeezing the job opportunities. Well actually, according to the supporting document of this proposal, the number of students participating in OPT is expected to be increased by 32,754 in the first year due to this extension. But the size of the US workforce is approximately 156 million and there are about 17 million STEM workers. The STEM OPT population would constitute only 0.19 percent of the total STEM population. It is unreasonable to relate unemployment issues to OPT program.\n\n\nFor the reasons above, I SUPPORT improving and expanding OPT program.

Educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent.\nA huge amount of international students will consider the OPT extension when they decide whether to pursue a degree in U.S or some other countries such as Canada, Japan, or Germany. \nTwo of my incredibly intelligent friends from China studying Electrical Engineering both decided to go to Japan to pursue a master degree because they were afraid the 17 months OPT extension was definitely too short for them to finish a proper project in any well-known national lab. \nThe 24 months OPT extension will attract more intelligent international students and better ensure that the U.S academic sector can remain competitive globally. \n\n2. Foreign students have regularly contributed a significant amount of money into U.S. economy through the payment of tuition, living expenses, and many other ways. \nFor instance, when students are on OPT extension, they pay more money on rents, food, transportations, going shopping (as the report indicated: $16.7 billion from 2013-2014), and therefore create more jobs in U.S. by significantly contributing to local economy.\nAlso, the tuition of an international student in any school is normally 2 to 3 times higher than the local students, which means the school can benefit a lot from foreign students and use the excessive money to improve the education environment for local students. Longer OPT extension will definitely attract more international students to put their money in U.S. universities.\n\n3. Students who are on OPT extensions are definitely NOT stealing positions from Americans workers. \nIndicated by federal laws, companies have to pay more on international employees and sign on a contract indicating they could not find any suitable Americans for certain positions and they had no choice but to hire a international employee. \nSTEM positions usually have very high requirements such as being talented and highly educated. Not a lot of people could satisfy the requirements of such positions. The cancellation of OPT extension will be a disaster for those companies who have such positions. They cannot hire those who are unemployed for a replacement since the unemployed people can never fulfill the requirements of these positions, because If they could, they would be hired before the international students. \n\nTherefore, regardless the passing or cancellation of this rule, the unemployed people will remain unemployed.\n\nAdditionally, most of people probably do not know, no more than 20% of the international students who are on OPT can eventually get a working VISA from the lottery and most of them actually want to go back to their home country in the end. 24 months OPT extension will give them enough experience, help them to get a competitive job in their home country, and eventually become a good reason for them to go home without coming back.\n\nHence, I strongly support the rule and hope to see it benefits millions of us.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Emily Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12837", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension and I believe OPT-extension if NECESSARY for our country.\nOver the years, foreign tech workers contributed a lot to the US economy and as a person working in Bay Area for several years, I can tell that these engineers are really hard-working, amazing and talented and I do have full respect of them!!!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Emily Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12319", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:\nThe government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..\nDiversity is very important to US", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vikki Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11104", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is an incredible opportunity for our country to have brilliant, diverse minds!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Madeline Mason", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2477", "postedDate": "2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "IT is past time we stop giveing jobs to people from other countires.

International students are not only seeking for advanced education but also industry experience in the U.S. Other countries like Canada already release such kind of regulation  to help international students gain valuable work experience. If students can't get what they want here they will turn to other places and therefore the country will lose a great deal of talented international students.\n\nIn addition, there would not be any side effect for American students. International students meet a lot of restrictions in terms of nationality when finding jobs. And they have to pass several difficult interviews to get a job since jobs for foreign students can never be as many as those for native students, which also ensure the equality mostly.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by stephanie Fan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18898", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly  opposing the extension.

After that, employees skills sharpened then employees can benefit the companies. \n\nIf we do not have the OPT extension, lots of companies in United States who hired international students would suffered heavy loss on both expertise and technology.

More time to work on my current project and some more money plus it will attract more international students to USA. But when I look at future of international STEM graduates I am not so sure about my decision to enter an endless race because of this messed by immigration system of USA; I would prefer to go to Canada, UK or Australia where I get more stable work permits if I want to work after graduation. Its an endless battle of luck and wait, I graduated with a computers degree and in the last semester took only 1 course to prepare for interviews. Spent almost 8months(2months OPT and 6months last sem) trying to find a job, for a new grad esp international student market is tough. Most of the jobs will not hire freshers for 80K -90K if they are getting experienced professionals for 60K (pool of consultants from vendors like infosys, Accenture). \nUSA software industry is driven by innovation and, we have the best developers in the world. Companies will pay you upto 200k if you are a good developer; But now companies hire people based on the length of Visa, if I have only 6months to 1 year of STEM left; most of the companies will not hire me even if I am more qualified than other candidates. If I am owner of a software/Tech company I will do the same; here is why: Every company has its own code base already in place and to understand thousands of line of code it takes minimun 3-6months to fully grasp what is actually happening; how things are running and getting connected. eg. how you use google search engine and yahoo search engine might be same but how they are coded is very different! So, if we reduce OPT period and do not implement this rule; most of the STEM graduates will end up with no jobs in USA. As cost of studying is very high in USA, it will become impossible to pay off student loans and it will be tough to go back to our country and find jobs without experience or training in real time work environment. Thus, I am very much in favor of increasing STEM work visa.\n\nWHAT MORE WE NEED TO FIX IMMIGRATION SYSTEM?\nI am just an inexperienced person to recommend a big thing as this but not a fool who does not see the problem in future because of our messed up immigration system.\nPROBLEM: consulting companies filling market with cheap employees!\nIf I am consulting company A, and have 200 positions to fill,  right now consulting company A is filing 600 H1 visas as probability of H1 lottery is 1:3 but If I get 400 H1s selected I will give remaining 200 employees to other company at cheap rates.\nSolution: Do not let consulting companies file 600 H1b visas and let them make immigrants work on low wages.\n\n1. KILL THE CONSULTING COMPANIES:-NOT AN OPTION \n As they file more and multiple H1b visas than required to grow their profits and most of the problem caused in market are due to low paid consultants but I think they are not at fault because its better to work for less money than no work \n\n2. REFORM H1b VISA TO BE PROFILE BASED RATHER THAN LOTTERY BASED: \nSince consulting companies have their own inhouse projects also; since consultants work at different clients and understand what the software industry requires . Consulting companies generally see the bigger picture \"What most software developers and software industry require?\" and sell software as solution to clients.\nSo, consulting companies are very important for Software industry.\nProblem: how to distinguish between consultants working at low wages compared to intelligent consultants developing amazing softwares?\nSolution: Monitor wages of consultants and give H1b to only those who have higher wages as they are more deserving to stay and contribute than other workers.\nProblem: Above solution is a HR violation as I will be forced to work for money rather than what I like!\nBut world is a bad place and for a better good its good to be bad with some!\nSo, in my opinion if we make immigration visas given to tech workers profile based since \"better profile\" === \"better salary\" i.e. salary based we will end up seeing more software companies opening in USA as we will attract more talent. I think the salary slips and for future employees offer letter stating salaries is a must for filing H1.

Engineers and scientists are engines of the society, they are the driving force to development, STEM students help improving the U.S. society development.\n\nThese are my comments, I hope the U.S. government can seriously consider this proposal.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sijia  Guo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16410", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Good for our economy and financial market!

I would like to give more details on why I am supporting this proposed rule. \n\nFirst, I question the rationality behind the statement of \"because of the OPT regulations, foreign STEM workers are replacing American STEM workers\". Following are my reasons:\n1. According to myvisajob.com, plenty of H1B workers (especially in the STEM field) were directly hired from schools outside of U.S. They did not even get their education in the U.S. They have nothing to do with this OPT rules. The only interpretation of this phenomenon is: Companies would never be satisfied with candidates in the U.S. job market. They will always find their way to seek for the best candidate for a position in a global scale. Limiting educated, skilled and legal workers is not THE WAY to providing more job opportunities for U.S. citizens. \n2. The OPT rule has been one of the attractions for many international students to come to the U.S. for education. In November, 2014, the U.S. government recorded 900,000 international students in the U.S. Most foreign students are paying TRIPLE or EVEN FOUR or FIVE TIMES for tuition compared to U.S. citizens. For foreign students, almost 100% of undergrads are paying full tuition at international student rate without any form of financial supports from U.S. sources; for international grad students, their tuition are even higher than undergrads'. Additionally, most international students are from middle class family and wealthy family. Foreign students' contribution to the U.S. economy does not only reflect on their tuition, but also includes all their spending within the U.S. Not to mention they bring tourists to the U.S. (Their friends and family). The implicit economical benefit from international students is uncountable. The OPT rule is always an advantage for the U.S. to attract international students, who have been contributing to the U.S. economy tremendously. \n\nThe most important reason of me supporting the new regulation on OPT is: Foreign students are not taking jobs away from Americans; in fact, they are creating jobs for Americans. Improving regulations and laws to allow well-educated, highly skilled and qualified foreign to legal work in the U.S. is eventually beneficial for every U.S. citizens. \n\n1. There are a lot of jobs continue to be created in all industries, because of the large amount of international students study in the U.S. This proposed rule is an advantage for the U.S. education industry to expand the foreign market. It directly creates jobs in the education industry and indirectly creates jobs in all other industries. \n2. There are many foreign students use their OPT time to work for startup companies or begin their own businesses(I personally know at least ten businesses were created by international students). They are the people who creates jobs for the U.S.\n\nAnother important fact: not every foreign student is using OPT. The proposed rule for OPT is only giving foreign students a chance to legally have occupational training in the U.S. It is a personal decision of a student to use it or not. Do not forget, even with the OPT rule, american students are still on the upper hand in the job market, compared to international students. On top of the tied job market, foreign students need to deal with culture shock, language barrier and even discrimination. Majority of companies are not providing H1B, so they tend to not consider international employees at all. In each year, the foreign students get authorized to stay and work in the U.S. is not even half of the amount coming.

I am an international student and I interned at a number of big name silicon valley companies.

The code I wrote either runs on thousands of machines in data centers to enhance the security, or will be part of next disruptively innovative product. One of my supervisors is also born in foreign country, and he lead the team to create the new product that can potentially make millions if not billions of dollars for the company. The new OPT extension will allow people like me to make contribution to the US companies and economy, and seek better career growth.\n\nThe United States is an immigrant's' country. Those US-born people who oppose legitimate and talented foreign students/workers: Don't forget that your parents or grandparents might be from other countries too. Don't forget it is immigrants that have made the US what it is and so strong. Don't forget that OPT workers are also paying tax for what everyone else is enjoying. Don't forget that without those talented foreign workers, there will be more US companies to fall due to lack of talents.\n\nI strongly support OPT extension but also urge for more investigation/prevention on frauds. OPT fraud is different than legitimate OPT student. Foreign workers should be introduced because their skills are truly in shortage, not because they can be paid less. I am a new graduate, and each of the offer letters in my hand could give me more than what 90+% US workers (experienced or inexperienced) can make. The companies want me because they truly cannot find enough qualified US-born new graduates to fill the position, not because foreign-borns are cheaper.\n\nAt the same time, I am also shocked to know how badly some people (not all!) are cheating on H1B visas. Those H1B cheaters fake resumes and experiences so that they could be hired in the US, to replace qualified skilled US workers. These H1B cheaters are often very incapable in their jobs and perform poorly. I don't want to work with such people because they lower the quality of the work and put the company in a worse position. They are at least part of the reason that US workers are so angrily against foreign workers. However, we should not forget that talented legitimate H1B workers (non-cheaters) are a great help to their US-born co-workers and they make the US companies stronger.\n\nLegitimate OPT workers are supposed to join the US workers in contributing to the US economy, not to replace them. There are indeed unemployment problems in the US. But the reason of that should be tracked to the education system. As a teaching assistant in a public university, I can tell that many students (native and foreign) are not well prepared for a future job of their own major. The same situation exist not only in the US, but also in other countries.

It's not only beneficial for the foreign students but also the U.S. society as a whole in the long term.\nFirstly, most of the eligible students with STEM degrees are valuable assets to many industries, especially the technology industry. Many of these STEM students have spent years studying and doing research in the U.S. and they have graduated from well established universities with advanced degree (i.e. MS or PHD). Giving them extended time to work in the U.S. essentially means that they can support and contribute to their industries utilizing the advanced knowledge and skills they have learnt in the U.S. For example, start up business which currently hires some STEM students will be heavily impacted if the rule doesn't go through. It will take them a long time to find replacements and the business will suffer which may lead to more unemployment. Since this rule is highly restricted to STEM students with jobs in their fields, the concern of the impact on the unemployment for U.S. citizens is irrelevant. To be honest, most employers will only consider the hiring of international students only when they can't find suitable candidates with U.S. citizenships or the students are exceptionally great in their fields. Many top scientists and entrepreneurs are used to be foreign students in the U.S. Thus granting these students extended training opportunities will help the U.S. maintains some of the top talents. In addition, this rule doesn't change anything about the immigration process. It's merely giving an opportunity to those students to contribute to the U.S. society. \nSecondly, these foreign students will contribute to the U.S economy directly by paying taxes and spending. Even though students who have been in the U.S for less than five years are exempted from social security and medicare tax, most students are here during their undergraduates or PHD programs pay the same amount of tax as U.S. citizens because they are considered as \"Resident\" for tax purpose. They also spend a considerable amount money on daily expenditures and traveling during and after their education. Many of them bring families and friends to visit during their stay which help the tourism industry significantly. In a time of decreasing daily expenditure from local households, the economy value of their stay in the 24 months should be considered.\nLastly, U.S. is a society which runs on meritocracy and equality. That's why U.S. has attracted top talents to come study and innovate in the past 20 years and I believe it will stay the same in the future.

However, the fact is that the job opportunity is equal for everyone no matter the race, color or nationality. Only the talented and hard working individuals will get the jobs and they deserve it.

Almost all the internationals are paying very expensive tuitions in the US universities.

Talents. NO company should hire people based on their race, sexuality or citizenship. A company should always hire people based on talent, experience and passion. \n\nAs is known to all that majority of technology companies are blessed with foreign talents with opt visa. They graduated from college in USA and now contribute their talent and time for American IT revolution and development.

Why are we importing more students when so many American graduates cannot get jobs matching their field of study? Why are we importing more students when there is so much American born competition for the limited number of seats in many colleges? Why are we importing more students when the cost of college, which is presumably driven by supply and demand, has far outpaced every other area of house-hold spending including the cost of a new home, the cost of a new car, food, gasoline, even health insurance.  Seems to me there is already enough demand for the limited amount of seats. \n\nWe need to focus on providing opportunity to American students instead of spending tax payer money and educational resources on imported students. If we have a shortage of students in a particular area, then lets start looking at spending additional dollars in our K-12 system to build that pipeline while we encourage and support those students. We need to treat our educational system as the precious national resource that it is. We need to realize the strategic advantage that our educational system affords the USA and treat is as seriously as we treat national security. \n\nPersonally, I am tired of importing students while natural born Americans are disadvantaged. I am tired of sending our jobs and talent to places in the world that have no love or respect for the USA. I will remember politicians and government officials who support American Citizens first. I will be sure to vote against politicians who place foreigners, illegal aliens, and imported labor and students ahead of American born citizens. \n\nNo other country on the planet provides benefits to imported students and labor.

From 2000 to 2013, analyzing Bureau of Labor Statistics data and adjusting for inflation, median salaries for workers in computer and mathematical, health care practitioner, engineering, and science occupations rose 8 percent, 7 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent respectively, even as those for the average U.S. worker showed no growth. Software developers, for instance, saw salaries soar 26 percent over the same period, culminating in an average of $82,000 in 2013, up from $48,000 in 1980.\n\n2. In addition, vacancies for STEM jobs are going unfilled in large numbers. Burning Glass, a labor market analytics firm, analyzed a report and found there are some 40,000 computer science bachelor's degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers. There is CLEARLY not enough supply of STEM students. \n\n3. In the private sector, software developers, petroleum engineers, data scientists, and those in skilled trades are in high demand. There are nearly not enough STEM student's to fill these positions. Expanding the STEM rule will help overcome the shortage and provide a significant boost to the US economy.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that US needs more STEM workers from reports and studies. DHS needs to pass this rule to help overcome the shortage otherwise this will set a huge setback for economy. International students bring talent and help business tremendously with STEM shortage.

It seems plausible, however, it is not true, as I will show the line of reasoning below.\n\nFirst of all, the number of job positions in a company are not static, but closely related to how well the tech company runs. Honestly, as far as I am concerned, why the IT industry of the U.S can dominate the world is that it has an open mind for foreign students. General speaking, these students are much more competitive than their U.S classmates, in terms of technical skills. These foreign students are both hardworking and smart, hoping to a technical expert. Because of these hardworking and smart guys, those open tech companies are more competitive and thus providing more job positions for the U.S citizens. The best example is the IT industry. It is hard to deny that the IT industry is one of the most profitable and active industry in the U.S. We can see there are a lot of foreign students dedicating to their work in IT industry. The CEOs of some IT giants are foreign students: the CEO of Google is a Stanford Alumni from India. \n\nSecond, these foreign students compel their U.S citizen counterparts to work harder and in turn strengthening the U.S. One counter example is from Detroit. Since the car industry in the U.S was no longer competitively to Japanese car industry anymore, its market share was nibbled by Japanese car industry. Final, the corruption of many car producers made many people lose their job opportunities. What a comparison between the car industry and IT industry.\n\n    \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xin Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14249", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Totally up for it!\nThis is a good policy to keep well-educated technical students and workers in the United States.

Americans will have MORE AND BETTER JOB OPPORTUNITIES. With graduates waiting in the job market, companies would like to create more opportunities which are opened to everybody. Americans always have their own advantages to be hired. Given that the extension is only applied to STEM majors, there will also be more openings in other areas, such as marketing and consulting, because huge efforts are needed to get the products created by engineers available to the public. As we know, these jobs are dominated by American people.\n\n2. American workers and international students will MORE SKILLFUL. The proposal allows students to have more time to work in US. Students will have more opportunities to apply what they learned into practice. Nowadays, the gap between school and industry is bigger. More training in real work will short the gap thus benefit both the whole industry and individuals. We could see a more competitive job market in the future. Also American workers will get improved in the competition, which allows them to make better contribution to US.\n\n3. American ECONOMIC WILL INCREASE and LIFE WILL BE BETTER. STEM students are only allowed to work for American companies, which makes the company more competitive. They are required to pay taxes as well, which will contributes a lot to improve peoples daily life. Since these students are from all over the world, their traveling and daily life will introduce more and more import and export trading, as well as local market, which is an important part to the economic increase. Also, people living in US will have more opportunities to access different cultures, which will provide people a wide perspective to look at the world.\n\nAll in all, extending STEM to 24 months will DEFINITELY benefit both Americans and international students.

I strongly support the OPT extension.\n\n1. The reason now there are a lot of international students(especially STEM students) in America is that they can take advantage of OPT extension to intern in USA for 29 months in total. Why this is important? We all know that industrial experience is very important for finding a job all over the world. Most international students hope to get the first hand experience right after graduation so that they can go back to home country and find a good job. Then why do STEM students need this extension? Most of the STEM projects are 2-4 years long. One year of experience is not enough for a project. So if the extension is canceled, then studying in American is no longer more attractive than studying in other countries. Less international students will choose to study in USA. Also, with only 1 year OPT, company has to find other people to continue the project, which will consume more and not easy to find. Then it will have a bad impact on the operation of the company. If less students come, the academic sectors will lose lots of talented people\n\n2. International students help to boost the economy. Many landlord rent their house/apartment to international students because domestic will always choose to stay at home and commute. If less international students come, landlord will lose this income.\n\n3.If the opt extension is canceled, what should the people already in extension do? what should their companies do? Everything is going all right but all of a sudden, tons of international students have to leave their work and the America economy will be impacted heavily.\n\n4. Competition do exists, but it does not mean that international students take over what should belong to US citizens.  Not many US citizens like to work/learn in STEMS area. And just because of these international students, the science in American is the top all over the world. When you do a research in those big companies, you can find that there are many international people working as managers..\n\n5. If facebook and uber (and some other companies) want to expand the market globally, they have to hire international students so that they can better understand the local market. \n\n6. I think the reason many US citizens disagree with the OPT extension is the fear of international students taking over their jobs.  Actually it will never happen. Most of the positions will not sponsor work visa so international students can only work with OPT and should leave when OPT ends. Besides, company hire people based on skills not based on your nationality. If OPT extension is canceled, less talented international students come to US for study, and these top tech companies will have a less chance hiring talented people..What will happen then? It will be hard for the US to keep its crown of science and technology field..\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yifei Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16333", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "NEW OPT STEM EXTENSION rule is needed.

But, it's better than none. The current OPT gives STEM degree'd students a maximum 29 months internship period. However, it doesn't provide a very convenient way to either employers or students to work on the OPT. Why? \n\nFirst, time is limited. Taking into consideration the students' job hunting time, companies hiring process and training procedure, the employer has very limited time to have the students contribute to it within one year, which is the first OPT period. A lot companies now realize that they end up doing the paper works, buying the office supplies and piling training materials and hours to prepare the student's leave and you can hardly expect his/her back, which sounds worse than a summer intern! \n\nSecond, it's worthless. Because of the high risk of hiring an OPT student, many companies stop hiring these fresh grads even though with highly demanded knowledge and skills. Some companies can only allow no pay or much less pay to trade off the risk. Eventually it caused the ugly competition between F1 students and native students. \n\nThird, no flexibility. In a lot cases the employer may be interested in keeping the student for longer period considering the project and job need. In other words, the company would like to make the student as a US worker. Due to a even sicker H1-B visa (US work visa) system, within maximum 29 months many F1 students can enter into the work visa lottery (yeah you don't read wrong, it's lottery!) once or at most twice (some lucky get three times though). So that leaves the employers a dilemma. What if the employer wants to keep the student? No, you can do nothing but cross fingers that the student gets the work visa lottery! You'd better get ready to make a budget for next round hiring. \n\nThe immigration system in general is so broken that millions of talented students, and maybe more potentially interested in studying in the states are discouraged by the fact that they have little chance of practicing their knowledge and skills after graduation. With that being said, we are losing many talented STEM specialists (which in turn becomes other countries' gain) as well as wasting time and money.\n\nHowever, the new proposal does give us more hope on not losing too much. \n\nWe may have them for three years. Many more things they can do to the companies. The average new hire's contribution comes from the second and third year. It gives the company enough time to decide if they are willing to keep them and find some way (maybe still go through the H1B lottery for 3 or 4 times, maybe go through green card application directly). \n\nAgain, it's not perfect, but it's much better than the current plan.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ting Jiang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21658", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I have more than ten alien colleagues in my companies.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nWe international students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nAdmitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jason Guo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13656", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal for the extension.\n\nThere are several reasons:\n\nFirst of all, we should make university and college students in the US, who have learned lots of advanced knowledge and mastered cutting edge skills, make some contributions to the US. \n\nAlso, we need diversity.

International students have been a very important group of American education system as they are contributing diversity, academic achievemnt to the country from technology development perspective, and since the number of international students is huge, the economic growth of the country also benefit from their huge amount of consumptions.\n\nSecond, the technology development would benefit from having more skilled, educated technicians. Let's take Silicon Valley, CA as an example: about 36% of the employees working for the technology companies are foreign born and the majority of the 36% employees are international students who are working on their OPT. Imagine that if the OPT extension rule was revoked, these international employees would be forced back home and that would bring a great loss for the companies. Many of the important ongoing projects could even be forced to stop forever. And that would definitely bring a negative impact on the technology and economic development for California and even the country (think about how important the Silicon Valley is in terms of technology and economic growth).\n\nThird, some people may hold the opinion that STEM graduates could work on the one-year OPT after graduation. But the fact is new hires will need at least 6 to 8-month training before they could get to know the work process of the company and make contributions. If they will have to leave right after they are ready to work more efficiently and effectively, companies would not even hire them at the beginning. The 24-month extension would definitely solve this problem, and it provides an excellent opportunity for both the employees to get more familar with the work and the employer to know more about the employee, it gives the employers more time to evauate the employee in order to make decisions on whether sponsoring the employee or not. Thus, this action will largely decrease the risk for both sides of employment.\n\nLast, becuase of the cap of the H1-B work visa, there are thousands of thousands of newly hired international employees competing for the limited positions (that's why it is called a lottery). Under this circumstances, strange phenomenons are appearing like companies specilizing in helping their employees particiting in this lottery even the employees are currently not in U.S.. And all these, as I think, are becuase the authorized work period after graduation was too short, if the OPT were extended, then DHS, USCIS, job market as a whole would have much less pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, extending the OPT would benefit all that were involved in this issue (the country and its economic and techology development, immigration department, job markets, students theirselves, etc.).

Most of them pay their tuition and living expense by themselves.  For this reason students parent will visit them sometime and this benefit american thousands of industries like tourism, food, car and others. As we know, most of US University or college are in lack of funding status, foreign students high expense tuition can greatly release college and University financial problem. Native students also benefit from it because most of native students need scholar ship and tuition waiver. The money foreign students contribute to University and College can make them operate well and keep high quality education which also benefits millions of native students. \n\n2. Most of IT company especially small company they are eager to hire Americans instead of foreigners for the native works protection policies and US owns millions of such small companies.  I don't believe foreign students are able to take away Americans jobs.  Most small companies they will firstly hire Americans not foreigners because foreigner have the high risk of not able to work for a long time for the reason of work authorization which Americans won't have such problem. Foreigners has language limitation and most of them can't socialize into companies culture.

Best international students come to US for her advanced education reputation. International students pay their tax, their tuition and contribute to both industry and academia. The working force formed by the international students in STEM areas are also positively influencing American economy. Both international students and local citizens are payed equally, international students won't lower the average salary. From my personal experience, I have international friends working in Facebook, Google and Yahoo. Their salaries are similar. When my international friends were at school as either undergraduates or graduates, they are not qualified to some scholarship that only accept US citizens. So it's unfair that international students lowered down the average payment in both industry and college. \n\nHigh tech industries need largely talented employees to contribute. However, the workforce produced by US citizen is not enough. International students, who graduated from STEM areas, are able to provide the extra needed workforce. International students are working together with US citizens to contribute the US economy. What's more, US high tech companies are expanding globally, they need international graduated students to join them and help them to be localized in different countries. \n\nThe risks of not passing this OPT-extension are in many-fold. First of all, it will decrease the attraction of the US education. Because international students not only want to gain their knowledge in colleges, but also want to apply their knowledge and gain industry experiences before they go back to their own country, or to continue to contribute to US economy. Second, there are lots of people working in companies under OPT extensions, if this become invalid, it will be a huge disaster for the companies because some of the employees will have to stop the work and go back to their own country. This is a huge huge huge loss for the companies and US economy. One year for projects in companies is too short, not much work will be done within one year. It's even more expensive to have some new people to continue the work than to have the old people to finish the work, if the old people have to leave due to the OPT short period. \n\nOverall, I do support this OPT-extension, I think it's beneficial to many aspects of America, including education, economy etc. \n\nSincerely,\nYang Sun", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yang Sun", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18747", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the regulation.

An important consideration was the general duration of projects to be pursued by students on STEM OPT extensions. DHS believes that students participating in practical training in STEM fields should be encouraged to pursue meaningful projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of their field of study and help develop the practical skills necessary to advance their careers. This type of significant projectoften involving a grant or fellowship application, management of grant money, focused research, and publication of a reporttypically requires several years to complete. Stakeholders have indicated, moreover, that this process often takes longer in the STEM community than in other academic or business areas. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) typically funds projects through grants that last for up to three years.

This Optional practical training (OPT) program benefits the U.S. economy in two aspects:\nFirst and the most important, it will U.S. education system more attractive to foreign student. In such a modern world, a degree means nothing without related work experience. OPT system provides such an opportunity for the foreign student a chance to practice the knowledges and skills they learn from U.S. universities so that they can be more competitive in the job market or even start their own businesses when they return to their own country. This OPT program makes a U.S. degree much more attracting to the foreign students when they are trying to decide where to spend their next several years college time and hundreds of thousands of dollars tuition. In 2014, more than 300,000 F1 visa were issue to foreign students. In average, each of those students spends 40,000 USD per year for their tuition and living cost. That is 12 billion dollar business. Without OPT program, a dramatic drop could be expected on that number.\n\nSecond, the OPT program (especially STEM extension) makes the technology companies in U.S. more competitive than their competitors in other countries like EU, China and India. It is a big brain drain from other countries. Every year, tech companies in U.S. hire best of the best among those foreign students and keep their advantage in the technology areas. Many may argue that U.S. are producing enough STEM graduates to its needs. The data is still arguable, because a large portion of the U.S. STEM graduates are foreign students. For example, more than 50% of the STEM PhD degree in U.S. are gained by foreigners. Even the number of american STEM graduates is larger than the openings, it is still necessary to hire the best engineers and scientists among the foreign students. This is simply because in such a globally competition world, either the high tech companies get the best of best or there is no high tech companies at all. The foreign students hired by high tech companies through OPT program are helping the companies grow and expand globally. In this sense, the OPT program is creating more high end jobs in U.S. and helping the economy here.\n\nAs above, the OPT program benefits the U.S. economy and should be supported. Due to the nature of the STEM jobs, one year training is not sufficient for the students to grasp the skills and two year is very reasonable time period for an extension. As a result, the new rule proposed by DHS should be supported.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Peng Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4989", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposed rule which would be a double win for both STEM major international students and the US.\n\nIn short term, the high tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Tesla and Apple, they need strong background international STEM students to help them developing new features.

USA companies need such talented students. \n\nI think as one of the most powerful countries in the world, USA should take the responsibility to educate and train talented young professionals to build a better world. OPT STEM extension provide an excellent opportunity to fulfill such a goal. Students from STEM need 24 months extension to have decent length of training in their field in order to consummate their college education which is a promise to the better future. \n\nMeanwhile, diversity nurtures innovation, fosters creativity. Bringing more talented STEM students to USA companies will greatly diversify the work force and benefit both the company and the people from this mix of culture and perspectives. When STEM students go back to their countries the training here will help to build a very firm and lasting cooperation and friendship between USA and the rest of the world. \n\nMoreover, competition is the soul of free market. Human dominates the world today as a result of winning natural selections which is a cruel competition process. Great leaders help us go through tough times after fierce competition in the campaign. Competition shows the path to an active and growing society. Allowing talented STEM students to join the workforce during the 24 months extension will definitely put pressure on American people. But such pressure is necessary to further grow and improve the competitiveness of USA workforce as to meet the demand of a better world. \n\nIt is my honor to give this short comment to support USA government making such a bright and wise proposal to increase the OPT STEM extension to 24 months.

This can potentially nourish more great companies and more job opportunities for local Americans. Why? First of all, F-1 STEM student has been greatly trained/invested by U.S top universities with their precious educational assets. They usually also have support from their families.(Their families usually have business resources across the globe so that they can afford the high tuition fee). Meanwhile, they are willing to take a lot of more risks by studying in a foreign country. (That's the spirit of immigration!) So F-1 STEM students are prepared educationally, psychologically and financially to become entrepreneurs. With the extension of 24 months, the total minimum stay of any F-1 STEM students will become 36 months. That is 3 years! It will be just enough for someone to think about starting their own company. This 3 year period will allow one to fail and try again for their business pursuit. This psychological effect can encourage more students to think of the option of founding their own company. Otherwise, F-1 STEM students tend to get a job right after their graduation to secure their stay in U.S. Last but not least, F-1 STEM founders will be more willing to hire their U.S companions not only because they want to embrace the U.S market but also because if they hire enough Americans in certain regions, they can file immigration petition for themselves.

Then please think how many U.S. students are majoring in STEM majors. Not a lot. I don't know why, but the number of U.S. students is really hard to meet the company's demands. If each year a lot of international students have to leave, this definitely will lead to a big regression in U.S. companies.

If they are forced to leave, how much diversity will be left in industry and research area? I do believe U.S. is always the leader in expanding diversity and realizing human well-fair, however, forcing the STEM students to leave just after 12 months is not something that support this. The international students stays in school for many years, how much experience they can gain in just 12 months after school?\n\nFor the second concern, any sensitive career is already investigated very thoroughly by the government and company before international students can have access to. I can't promise this will never happen, however, this is the risk people have to pay if you want diversity and development.

Some of those students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. DHS must therefore act swiftly to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the 2008 IFR. Prompt action is particularly appropriate with respect to those students who have already committed to study in the United States, in part based on the possibility of furthering their education through an extended period of practical training in the world's leading STEM economy", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xinyue Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7585", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support.

The STEM students are NOT competing with most American workers. Most jobs these students take are the developer or modeling positions that require advanced quantitative skills, which most American do not enroll in college or graduate studies. Just look at the percentage of foreign students in the STEM majors. Without proper work authorization for the STEM students, most large tech companies will relocate their development department off shore, which is already a trend due to the broken H1-B system. Think about it again for those Americans claiming that STEM students stealing their job opportunities! If there is no attraction to students studying in STEM majors in US, there will be NO reason to place the company offices in US for those large global companies!\n\n2. The arguments by some of the American workers that foreign students have advantage because of a lower salary than hiring an American are NOT TURE. Companies generally pay the same salary for the same position, regardless of the citizenship. Actually, to hire an international student, companies generally need to pay more for their visa and work authorization petitions such as H1B or even green card application, which costs significantly amount of money to hire lawyers and pay application fees.\n\n3. The objection by most commenters are BLINDED and simply pointing to a WRONG group! What really takes the job opportunities from American workers are those who applied work visas abusively from overseas directly. Out of the 65K quota for H1b every year, tens of thousands are simply taken by the few indian consulting companies (namely Infosys, Tata). See: http://www.myvisajobs.com/Reports/2015-H1B-Visa-Sponsor.aspx\n\nDue to the abusive behavior by these indian consulting companies (some even filed 7-8 petitions just to increase the chance of being picked in the lottery), the chance for a student with advanced degree in US has become notoriously low (probably only 20% for a bachelor degree, and 40% for MS degree or higher, and this is expected to be significantly lower in 2017 Fiscal year).\n\nThe fix to the H1b system is necessary with no doubt! Unfortunately, there won't be any solution in a short term due to the well-known notoriously slow legislation in US. This new ruling is effective to provide students in US the fair right to work for US companies without any interruption in their practical training or worrieness about work authorization issue. The objection by most commenters should be towards the BROKEN H1b system- which has brought a lot of Indian \"technicians\" into US to consume the training resources in US before they can actually work competently and directly compete with graduates from US universities. Actually, students that have completed studies in US need to be protected rather than be blamed, to improve the quality of US productive power.\n\nI myself have obtained a PHD in applied math and have not been selected in the past two years' H1b lottery.Ridiculously the opportunities have been robbed by all these Indian outsourcing companies!! They are the root cause of all these drama, and should be banned, while students studying in US should be protected and ensured for appropriate practical training opportunities even immigration advantages!\nFortunately, I have succeeded in my O-1 visa petition right after my OPT ended in Oct 2015. My company and myself have spent significant amount of time and effort in getting these through. Honestly, if there were no such drama due to the broken H1b system or if a longer OPT extension can be approved, my company and myself could have spent all these time in work and research, rather than dealing with all these visa and authorization issues!\nThere are tens of thousands of US graduates awaiting this new rule to be approved! If this is not approved, it will be a loss to everyone in US: foreign graduates, US citizens and US companies! Who will celebrate? The large proportion of \"machine-like\" technicians shipped from India and need to be trained before they could compete with anyone that have already completed advanced degrees in US!\n\n4. The arguments that there will be a loss in Social Security/Medi Care is SHORT SIGHTED. As previously mentioned, without OPT for foreign students, there will be less to no advantage for US universities than other countries' universities. The tuition income for US universities and all related income generated by foreign students will be lost. In addition, students that stayed in US for more than 5 years in F-1 status or transferred to a H1-B status or Permanent Reisdency still require to pay the Social Security and Medi Care Tax, which seems to be simply OVERLOOKED by most negative comments. \n\nFor the future of US economy, this rule needs to be approved without any question. Think twice for those objecting to this rule!\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoping Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22099", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STRONGLY SUPPORT!

Given the fact that we also pay a tremendous amount of college tuition, often without financial aid, I believe it is only fair that we are given adequate opportunities to pursue such academic experience through OPT as well as enough time to gain concrete experience. Being an international student from Ghana pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, I have experienced a number of disappointments regarding gaining internships due to my citizenship status and knowing that the current OPT system only allows 17 months to gain such experience makes tertiary education in the United States very daunting for my fellow-international students and me. Since we also have the academic qualifications to attain such employment, I believe this new extension would greatly benefit not only us but also the United States as a whole. With our inherent drive to persevere and succeed, I assure the Government of the United States that implementing this new extension would significantly boost the United States economy as well as ensure that the United States remains very competitive as the superpower the nation is today.

The reason why I came to USA to continue my academic development was mainly that universities in the US provided the OPT for the foreign students and even an extension period for students who are qualified with STEM. This OPT program is provided only in the US which gives more options to the foreign students. If it does not exist, I would have rather chosen another country, for instance Canada, for my further development.\n\nFurthermore, there are thousands of international students who are already in the OPT extension period. If it is cancelled, ALL of them would have to leave the US which might lead a unpredictable lost for the companies they are working for. Moreover, STEM OPT extension is very possible the main reason for them to choose to study in United States. \n\nInternational students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.\n\nForeign students, for example, regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students.\n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous experience, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers of those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nHonestly, I do not understand why some of the US citizens complain about that they are treated worse than the employees who are in OPT. First of all, companies who hire OPT employees have to take the risk that those employees fail on the H1B lottery, which is very likely since the number of H1B applicants have grown significantly lately. They would rather hire US citizens instead if there are qualified ones; Secondly, companies have to pay more to those who are working in OPT status in order to satisfy the minimum salary requirement of H1B application; Thirdly, the truth is, most of my friends(including me) found that it is really hard for OPT students to get a job in Mechanical Engineering industry due to the \"VISA issue\".  \n\nTo those complainers who said that they are treated unequally. Before an employer can participate in the E-Verify program, the employer must enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHS and SSA. This memorandum requires employers to agree to abide by current legal hiring procedures and to follow required procedures in the E-Verify process to ensure that E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. Violation of the terms of this agreement by the employer is grounds for immediate termination of its participation in the program. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jing Ouyang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12089", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I undoubtedly stand for this proposal. it will be a great loss for all Americans,  no matter native or international, to loose these talented people.

At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00).

If the OPT extension rule is cancelled, then students will go other countries with OPT system, negatively impacting the US economy.\n\nSecondly, international students are the backbone of the US tech sector. With OPT extension rule, employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies.

They want to prove the value of themselves by devoting their talents to this country because they believe that the United States is a nation of freedom. \n2. Diversity is the bed stone of the United States. It is also the season that the United State became what she is today.  Known as the Melting Pot, this country has a reputation of embracing immigrants throughout her history. Why can a country accept immigrants from all over the world, while it says no to these nonimmigrant students who has high-end technology and science knowledges? It is ridiculous that these F-1 nonimmigrant students got rejected although they have the willing to dedicate themselves, unlike some immigrants who just took advantages of this country. \n3. Competition does exists, but it is in a good way. Most F-1 nonimmigrant students do not intend to compete against the natives. They merely take over the positions that most Americans dont want to do at all. Why would a company pay thousands of dollars to employ an international student instead of a native-born American? It is because the company couldnt find an appropriate American candidate who is willing to do the STEM job. These STEM international students just fill in the empties otherwise the whole system will breakdown. \n\nIn summary, I highly AGREE that the United States to extend the STEM OPT period by 24 months for the sake of the United States and her people.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by SHAOLING QI", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16110", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this new rule because it greatly helps the country to retain talents.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sandeep Bollapragada", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16430", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "See attached file(s)", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lori Christensen", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4464", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally support to approve this immigration proposal!!!\nTechnology is the primary work force in this century and those F1 students provide this country a steady technical support.

I read some of the opponents' comments and I found almost all of their comments make NO sense at all. Now I will refute some opponents' opinions and prove those opponents to this rule are deadly wrong.\n\n1. Some people claim that many US students cannot find jobs in their dream companies while many of those positions in their dream companies are taken by international students. It might be true but it doesn't mean anything, because companies have their own requirements when hiring new employees. Their requirements are much more strict than graduation requirements. For example, Yahoo requires that all applicants must have a GPA of higher than 3.5 and Oracle requires a GPA of higher than 3.8, while graduation in most colleges only requires 2.0. Of course there must be many US students with low GPAs who cannot find jobs, while companies are still in shortage of US students with GPA of 3.5+. On the other hand, because US universities favor US students over international students in admission process so the admitted pools of international students are generally better than US students. In colleges, the admission rate of international students is much lower than that of US students. This discrimination policy will have an effect on the college study. The GPAs of US students are evenly distributed between 2.0 and 4.0, while almost all international students get GPA of 3.5+. Most students with a GPA of 4.0 are international. It's apparent that when competing for jobs, international students are in a advantage. However, if a US students is able to get a GPA of 4.0, companies will welcome him MUCH MORE THAN they do to international students and give a salary higher than international students with the same GPAs, because there aren't many US students with that GPA, and most students with that GPA are international. It means smart US students are still in high demand, AS LONG AS they are qualified and pass the company's minimum requirements.\n\n2. Some people who claimed the jobs are taken by foreign students may NOT know the hiring process. Here is my own experience. Last year, Palantir, a famous company in Silicon valley, came to my university to recruit. They conducted an info session where they introduced their company. In the info session, they claim they are in shortage of qualified engineers and there are always empty positions for which they cannot find qualified people every year. I asked them two questions: \nThe first question is: There are so many good students who can NOT find a job so why do you say you cannot find qualified people? \nThe second one is: Does nationality, for example, US citizens or foreigners, make any difference in your decision process? \n\nHere is their answer: \n\"Every company has a bar (criteria) when selecting students and we enforce this bar for every students. Among those who pass this bar, we will give offer to US citizens or Permanent residents FIRST. If there are positions after we recruit all American students who pass the bar, then we will give offer to those foreign students who pass this bar. If there are still empty positions after we recruit all the foreign students who pass the bar, we will LEAVE those positions EMPTY. We will NEVER lower our bar and we will NEVER recruit those who failed to pass the bar, NO MATTER whether you are a US citizen or a foreigner, even though we are in shortage of engineers. If there are not enough positions, we will give offer to American students who pass the bar first. But for now, we have sufficient positions for EVERYONE who passes the bar. If you are American and you pass the bar, we will gladly welcome you MORE THAN we do to foreigners. If you are a foreigner and pass the bar, we welcome you, too. But if you failed to pass the bar, we will NEVER give you an offer, even though we have empty positions.\"\n\nBased on my understanding, he means their bar is much higher than the graduation requirements. Even if all foreign students are driven away, they will leave those positions empty, NOT give offers to American students who FAILED to pass the bar.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhehao Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10520", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Seeing so many people are voting to against it makes me feel so disappointing. I hardly think some of them don't even know what is OPT and just go against it. As an Actuary, I only state several facts why I strongly support it: \n1. As far as I know, many insurance companies hire internationals and provide immigrant support for them, why? Simply because the amount of native talents does not sufficient enough to support job market. Employers help us stay, not because they want to, for they have to. If OPT could extend to 24 months, it will be a big relief for both employers and international employees, for they now can focus on work and unleash their potentials, rather than worrying about identification issues.\n\n2. Now for actuarial program, why so many international graduates every year? Simply because US natives would not join the program. Internationals fill gaps and pay higher tuition, comparing to locals; so they truly support universities finance and bring competition/vibration into campus, not to mention the prestigious reputation they spread out around the globe; hence, extend OPT, or at least, keep OPT as it was, for STEM students, is a great bonus to attract international students.\n\n3. With more high quality immigrants, they can help US to boost Economy again, example, we are expanding US dollars everyday, for shopping, traveling, paying rent, purchasing cars, etc. Where does every penny would go? Eventually, it flows into financial system and government's tax, and goes back to US families' accounts.\n\nThat's all I want to say.  \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yu Xiang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21295", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the extension of OPT.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lei Fang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1262", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As long as we care about the whole country's well fare and the the benefit of the US people, we should focus on the booming up of the US industry especially in tech-related sectors.

A professional with newly gained skills on the upcoming technology is the best fit to take the load on of millions of requirements posted not only by private sector companies but also public. \n\nThe STEM OPT makes sure talent such as that stays where they are needed without any hassles that may jeopardize not only their position but also the important work that needs to be done. \n\nThis country is and was made on hard work.

To stay ahead, or even just to keep up, America has to uphold its values of acceptance, meritocracy, and diversity. This is not possible if we don't extend the current OPT period for STEM majors.\n\nThe group of individuals concerned in this policy are those who:\n1) have a passion for science and technology, so much that they are willing to experience the great language and/or cultural, as well as possible financial barriers to study in the United States;\n2) have received the advanced technological education from the United States, and are highly capable of contributing to the productivity and innovativeness of America's existing technology industry, proven by the fact that companies agree to sponsor their visas through this currently ineffective system;\n3) are not those who would be needing assistance from the US government, but they will be contributing tax dollars as well as productivity to our country;\n4) are selfless enough to be away from their families and friends abroad, to work for our companies, and to our benefit.\n\nLooking at the status quo, the problem is clear. There are huge numbers of talented individuals, who have worked hard during their studies here, are willing to work for us. However, the cap on H1-B visas per year is severely limited, and is unlikely to change in the short run. As a result, our country is missing out on hundreds of thousands of talents, who can bring in their knowledge to the advancement of our tech industries. Our companies, as well, suffer huge opportunity cost in sponsoring the visas and getting rejected, leading to inefficiencies in the hiring process. Extending the OPT period will temporary alleviate the problem, by allowing workers to enter in the H1-B lottery in three years while they are allowed to legally work here. This policy will have tremendous benefit, as it give the Congress a longer window to enact change in our immigration policies, which will effectuate a long-term change to attract the necessary talent needed for America to keep up with the trend of modernity.\n\nWhy are these highly-skilled workers absolutely necessary for our country to stay ahead? The fact that our firms are wiling to go through all the trouble and cost just to hire these workers prove that these workers are essential to their competitiveness. Without them, our companies are at risk of losing out to foreign competition in this fast-evolving industry. We might lead the world today, but a tomorrow without the talents from all over the world will not be ours. Firms losing out in such competitions will only lead to ever more job losses and a shrinking tech industry. \n\nThese workers are not hired because they are cheaper than our domestic workers. We are not talking about a minimum wage level industry. This is an industry which is willing to pay a huge premium on wages just to reduce the turnover rate and keep its talents. These workers are hired because they are more capable than their peers. This is a system of merit, for which we as a nation fought so hard for. We chose not to discriminate against on basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, and etc. Don't let ourselves discriminate against where an individual is born.\n\nAmerica is a national founded and built by immigrants. Immigrants provided the necessary technology, labor, and more to different periods of our nation's development. In other words, we are here because of our values of acceptance and meritocracy. It is exactly because of the fact that we hire those who are capable despite their skin color, gender, or nation of birth, that we are able to thrive as the most powerful nation on Earth, providing one of the best standard of living in the world. Rejecting this policy, we disown our cherished belief for meritocracy. Rejecting this policy, we turn away from our culture of acceptance. Rejecting this policy, we risk losing our eminence in this current of technological advancement, only to be washed ashore to the obsoleteness that will takes years even decade trying to catch up.\n\nEmbrace acceptance, embrace meritocracy, embrace a future where talents, no matter their origin, are able to work for this great country, not only in the present, but also in the future. STEM OPT is just a first but necessary step towards this bright future.

If STEM students have 24 months opt,it means they have 2 chances to apply for H1B visa.As applicants for H1B increasing and accumulating year after year,the later students begin to study in the US, the worse chances for them to get H1B visa. \nreason 2: It's not fair to residents. For some STEM areas like chemistry or physics, it's pretty hard for a student to find a job in industry. If there are more F1 students to compete them, they have lesser chances to find a job because F1 students are easier to be abused. F1 students are more tolerant to lower salary,overtime working and worse working environment because they want to keep their H1B status. For instance, one of my friends is studying child development in a community college(De Anza college) to wish to get a job in a kindergarten. The problem is that she has a BS degree in biology from UCSD, which is ranked #39 in the nation. She can't find a job even she graduated from a good school. Thus, extension of opt will make the situation worse and not fair to both residents and F1 students.\n\nExtension of OPT may benefit IT industry before. However, it harms residents as well as F1 students. American lost too many jobs during last 15 years. It's getting harder to find a job for some major like biology or physics. Now with the extension of OPT, it will make more residents like my friend to work in an area they don't want. Moreover, it's not easy to find a job in IT industry recently because too many students are studying computer science. If we extend STEM OPT, those residents who are studying computer science will suffer what biology students already suffered--no jobs available when graduate.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Loy Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15867", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This program should be abolished!

However, foreign students are using this program as a bridge to stay in the US and employers are using it to get cheaper labor and get around the H-1B caps.\n\nAt present, there are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the US, another almost 100,000 are in 12-month OPT programs and still another 30,000 are in 29 month OPT programs.  This is already a too big pool of nearly 700,000 foreign student who are being trained at our expense to take away jobs from American STEM workers.  Here is why that is very bad for America:\n\nOPT workers are younger so they are cheaper (Salary) to employ, but they are far less experienced, too.  In addition, employers don't have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes for OPT employee, who do receive benefits without having to pay for them.  The OPT workers holds down a good paying job ($60,000 to $90,000) keeping American STEM workers out of work while costing Social Security more than 1 Billion dollars annually in unearned benefits.\n\nWhen this program was created by congress, it was obvious that the intent was to have these students go back to their original country.  It has been modified, and your proposing to further modify it to make it more and more likely that these students WILL stay in the US and further unfairly compete with American STEM workers.  This is CLEARLY against the original intent of congress (by creating a shadow H-1B program) and the best interest of the American people.    \n\nLastly, the GAO says that this program is \"inefficient\" and \"susceptible to fraud\".  Further, the GAO says that the DHS does not track the living and working locations of these foreign students to know if they have over stayed their visas or if the students have become security threats and would not track them under the new proposed rule.  This is a major deficiency in the rule and a major security threat to the US.\n\nThe new proposed rule should not go in to effect.

The proposed rule would require that the terms and conditions of a STEM OPT student's employment are commensurate with those for similarly situated US workers.\nWhat other US workers can be found who are conducting three year traineeships? This leaves no comparables, and so the employer will pay the least amount of compensation it can and likely no benefits, with the argument that it is \"training\". DHS would not have a viable argument that the company is not meeting the requirement because there are no similarly situated US workers.\n\nThe proposed rule would like to expand the program to include foreign students who obtained STEM degrees (likely outside of the US) but are in the US studying in a non-STEM program, however the extension would only be available to those who seek to develop and utilize stem skills. This seems highly irregular. Prior STEM students may not have been accepted to a US university in their STEM field due to lack of ranking or qualification of their prior university. That selfsame student might come to the US to study business or any other non-related field, and yet still be eligible for a training extension on stale or unqualified skills.\n\nThe proposed rule is particular damaging to US university students and US recent graduates in STEM fields. In the proposed rule it states that, \"hundreds of thousands of international students are currently pursuing courses of studying fields that may provide eligibility for this program\". These students are in the age bracket of 18-28. Each US high school student who intends to study must have an available position at a US university.\nThe current number of foreign students at US universities is circa 700,000. Foreign students make up about 4% of the US post-secondary school population, but the statistics are much higher at the higher ranking schools.\nThis leads to tougher competition forcing the US student into competition for a coveted place. The proposed rule is designed to encourage more foreign students to study at US universities which will only exacerbate the competition. The proposed rule damages the US university student again upon graduation, when those seeking employment in STEM fields are competing with a OPT practical trainee to whom the employer can keep in trainee status with commensurate low pay and little or no benefits for up to three years. Then comes the final blow, when the company, having the OPT completely trained and skilled in the job after three years decides to obtain an H1B or E-visa for that person rather than hiring on the market.

I'm sure this act will provide them the necessary time to hone their skills so that they can make even more contributions to their employers as well as America.

I don't know what are all those arguments about because that is not the case that I have seen in the companies I've been work for. I work in the technology industry, computer science to be exact, I've talked to many HR's and engineers in many other companies, they mostly complains about not being able to hire quality employees, and some companies even spend few months before they can hire the right guy, if they do find the right guy, they ARE willing to pay enough to keep them, be the guy American or foreigners. So those people's arguments that STEM OPT students lower the wages and stealing American's jobs is definitely invalid if not wrong. Employers aren't that stupid to hire people who is willing to earn less because those people tend to be less competitive. Moreover, STEM OPT students are only a small friction of all the foreign students graduated from the college each year, remember that, this extension is only for students who study SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING and MATH, think about that, how many great innovations have came out of these fields over the past few decades.

As we know, most of US University or college are in lack of funding status, foreign students high expense tuition can greatly release college and University financial problem. Native students also benefit from it because most of native students need scholar ship and tuition waiver. The money foreign students contribute to University and College can make them operate well and keep high quality education which also benefits millions of native students. \n\n2. Most of IT company especially small company they are eager to hire Americans instead of foreigners for the native works protection policies and US owns millions of such small companies.  I don't believe foreign students are able to take away Americans jobs.  Most small companies they will firstly hire Americans not foreigners because foreigner have the high risk of not able to work for a long time for the reason of work authorization which Americans won't have such problem. Foreigners has language limitation and most of them can't socialize into companies culture. Companies need to pay H1b application fee and lawyers fee to help them to apply H1 petition and still have the high risk of losing them because of current H1B cap.\n\n3.OPT STEM students are highly educated people and skilled.

But, learning is not just for studying, but also hand on experience. Sometimes you even learn more during the internship than just reading the book. Also, while the international student doing the OPT program, they bring what they learn from the school to the company. The company can not only received the newer knowledges or techniques soon, but also can have the skills that the international student brought to the country. Which is good for American economy. Just like Canada, they took many high technique people to their country to help out the high skills work demand, they save a lots of money to train people, and also raise their economy at the same time.

It is because of the joint contribution of both US citizens and non-US citizens that it is now the biggest economy in the world. Second, if many international students who are doing research or employed by scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics institutions and companies have to terminate their work because of the OPT extension, it will not only be a loss to themselves but also to the institutions and companies.

We need more time to focus on one project to make it done completely and perfectly.

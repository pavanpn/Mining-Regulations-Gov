My parents want me to choose Canada and Australia as the target due to their easier immigrant requirement, but I prefer to study in the U.S because America has the most advanced technology, the opening culture and more importantly, provides the OPT policies to allow me to increase my working experience and put knowledge learned from classroom into practice. If stopping the OPT for international students, the U.S. would lose its attraction to prospective talents from other countries. Those talents not coming to America would choose other destinations, like Canada, to pursuit their careers, which increases Canadian competitiveness in scientific technology and enhances their talent pools, and on the contrary, decreases American talents advantages in scientific field. \n\nAlso, 12-moth OPT is not enough for most projects in STEM related industries like IT, math, and trading. 24 moth would be perfect to finish a research project. My current project-developing algorithms and application on video surveillance- founded by National Science Foundation of China in a research institute is an ideal example.  We start this project last October, and have been allowed to have 2 year to finish it. I found research is a process of accumulating knowledge and experience. It takes time to build theory, do experiments, analyse results and then refine the old theory, do new experiments, and analyse fresh results. Mostly we need to repeat above process a lot of times until getting the satisfied outcomes. \n\nThe last but not the least, some people protest that those F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees have occupied a great many of job positions that would be theirs with a low payment. However, it is not the case at all. Because Mentoring and Training Plan has prevented employers from terminating, laying off, or furloughing a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student. Besides, most highly educated students would not be willing to accept a job with a low payment since their families have invested a lot on their tuition and fees during the period of studying oversea. So those criticisms are not reasonable and logic at all. \n\nI realize extending OPT is a win-win strategy not only for American people but also for those students willing to open their eyes.

The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually gives employers an incentive to hire foreign students instead of American workers because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Susan Jacques", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8595", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "    With all of the problems of unemployment here is the United States I find in rather unproductive to be giving the opportunity to immigrants, over citizens, to come into the country and what amounts do nothing to improve the employment of citizens.

If US still want to be the leading power of the the world, a more open attitude to people from the other country would be necessary.\n3) I found people are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries. However, I don't think they have to worry about this at all. Because OPT extension is for STEM only which means the rule only applies in limit areas that really need excellent people from all around the world. That is the reason why US is the most powerful country in the would.  I do not think this will cause competition to most of the US citizens.\nTo summarize, I really think OPT extension would benefit US's economy, and keep US the leading power of the world.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Haoyu Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19428", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Its ridiculous to bring in foreign workers when 1,000's of people HERE in the US would love to have or train for these jobs.

These exposures adds up to their training experiences and once on 1st year of OPT they start working full time like any other regular candidates. Now while filing STEM extensions most of the students already have 1 to 1 and half years of US work experience (on top of any previous work experience in the field from their origin country). In fact towards the end of the 1st year OPT many students file their H1 visa applications too. Some may even have already changed jobs or in process of changing jobs while filing the STEM extension, so it may not make any sense to ask the new employer for these paper work when the employer is hiring the student thinking he is an experienced candidate to do the job. Therefore, I feel the Mentoring and Training programs may add up to unnecessary paper work in some scenarios for employers. This would even make harder for students to find a job easily because the process may seem too much extra work to employers or may make them feel the candidate is not yet prepared for the job since he needs training. I think the Mentoring and Training program needs modification depending on the students education and work profile, specifically in case of Graduate Students. Though I feel this regulation will put a restriction on students who graduate with other degrees such as Health Science, Electronics, Biotechnology etc but just take one computer course during their course work and then use that course to file their STEM extension to keep working in the field of Information Technology. This is a big loop hole which DHS should look into, many students do not find job in their specialization and but they find job in Information Technology so to save their status they jump into totally different field then their major.

US has provided the most outstanding training for students from all over the world. Reasonably, the US may want something in return from the students after they are well-trained. We, the trained foreign graduates, do want to add values to this country as a return too. However, due to the strict working visa policy, it is extremely hard for new graduates to obtain working authorization right after they graduate, and thus OPT and the extension to OPT serve as a crucial buffering period, so that the STEM graduates can work for the US without any delay after they finish their trainings. \n\nSome may worry that hiring the STEM PhD will reduce job opportunities for others. This is UNTRUE. The trainings STEM students received are highly specialized, and therefore the jobs they are suitable for are also highly specialized. It is very unlikely that these jobs can be done by someone who is not from the STEM fields. It is obvious if one takes a look into the job openings that recruit STEM graduates, these can be done only by STEM graduates, and there are definitely more job openings than the number of American STEM graduates that would take these jobs.

It would not affect the working opportunities for American citizens. Instead, it would rise more job opportunities for US citizens. I have the following reasons. \n 1. The new rule would attract more international students to study in the US, even if they need to pay higher tuitions to get a degree. This would increase the fund dramatically for the educational institutes in the US.\n 2. For most brilliant international students who are pursuing their master or PhD degree in the US, the funding for their tuitions and stipend is from US schools. We paid for their education, why we would send them out to make contributions to other countries? \n 3. I would not worry that the extension would not threat the job market for American people. Because the students are only allowed to find a job in STEM areas at which most American people are not good at. In addition, the intense competition would make sure that only the smartest persons can be kept in the positions. If the students do not have extraordinary competence, they would not be able to find a job in the US. \n 4. The brilliant international would make great contributions to this country. Take a look at the famous and prosperous companies in California no matter on computer, mobile, internet or biology, how many international people are working hard there as leadership? They would not develop so fast and create globally pioneering activities without these smart people.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n \n\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\n \n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n\nShiming Ren", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shiming Ren (2nd Comment)", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6209", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "While I'm sorry for your son, this proposal has nothing to do with him, as he is just out of high school and apparently not even involved in STEM.

Students who go to college and university or enroll into their master or PhD program take education seriously and eagerly expect to gain not only knowledge from in-class courses but also experience in real industry. OPT, as a novel further extension for high level education which is developed by the U.S., fully embodies the excellent education system of the U.S, and has being expected to be a more practical and complete rule by all international students who come to the U.S for high level education, not only STEM students, but also many other students in extensive majors.\n\nSecondly, one-year OPT is totally not enough for STEM students both for timing of seeking a job and for practicing their knowledge gain from school. We all know that its hard for a newly graduated student to find a job or even internship position when he or she just comes out from school. This seeking-job period might take a student for at least 2 months or even longer. The longer the student spending on finding a job, the more stressful and frustrated they feel and the more unconfident they are in both themselves and the education system, and obviously, the shorter time they have to touch the real related professional work for their majors. OPT is great in its original purpose but if its just as short as one year, it might let the students feel its just a product of formalism and has lost its original practical meaning.\n\nThirdly, one-year length OPT makes companies feel reluctant to hire STEM students. Hiring an employee is a costly thing for any company and hiring a newly graduated student with little experience might be even expensive for the reason that the employer must take time and efforts to train the fresh man first and then could expect them to work in a productive way gradually. This process might take at least half year or even longer than one or two years in certain highly technical industry especially for STEM students, such as research or engineering. One-year OPT really makes companies feel uncomfortable to hire STEM students on OPT because they might have to leave just when they can actually contribute something to the company. In my own case, it has already taken me  8 months to get familiar all the platform and software suits in my company and I still cannot say Im the main work force in my team. Maybe I can say that after another half year confidently, but at that time, I have to leave because of the one-year OPT length. And my manager will be worried about hiring a new guy and rethinking of all the cost to train him or her. So extending OPT for another 24 months might solve this problem perfectly and make companies feel safer to hiring STEM OPT students and make the students feel justifiable that they can practice more and contribute more in a proper 2 year extension.\n\nFourthly, STEM students are important for a countrys economics. Not only the U.S, all countries need STEM professional to develop new technologies and make great research in cut edge areas of science to push their economics moving forward. U.S has been leading the worlds economy for a long time and one of the most important reasons for that is U.S pay great attention to STEM students and has been trying its best to attract these students into the corresponding industry to generate miracles. So please keep consistent on this and take all the opportunities in this to produce more growth for this country. The decision regarding to the length of OPT extension looks just one issue among huge amount of issues of this society, but its actually a very critical one that embody the countrys attitude and policy in attracting high tech professionals and growing future work force in STEM area.\n\nTo sum up, the proposal of 24 months OPT extension is really a great one and will benefit not only the STEM students but also the country and will making U.S educational system more complete and practical and will definitely contribute to the developing of the economy in the long run. So I strongly support this proposal and I do hope my voice heard. \n\nThank you very much.\n\n\nBest Regards\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Relley Edward", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12412", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is glad to hear about the potential opportunity of extending the OPT for STEM major to 24 months, and I strongly support this decision. \n\nThere are tons of jobs that needed the students with extensive training in the STEM major.

Also not to forget the amount of paperwork that will need to be dealt with for providing the information to college about the mentoring and training program. Although training is important, may be for the first year of OPT it makes sense, but when we apply for extension, I am not sure how training would matter because most of the times we would already be trained in a year and start working independently to gain hands on experience and that way we learn better and try to push ourselves to be more productive and innovative.\n3. Why can't the already existing rule be applied with only the increase in duration? The college anyway approves STEM OPT extension based on employment in the STEM field.  \n\nMay be some changes in the mentoring and training program can be done in the rule so that it benefits both the employers and the STEM students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2521", "postedDate": "2015-10-27T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We must stop being a \"Pay to Play\" government and giving big donors the say in who we allow to come here to work!\nThis is hurting American workers and students just getting out of college.

This is very important, because it implies these STEM students are either very talented who usually came to U.S with a merit-based full ride scholarship or have good financial support from their family in that they are able to afford their tuition which is roughly around 25k ~ 50k dollars every year. (As a side note, tuition for international students are usually 3-4X higher than domestic students especially for public universities, and international students are NOT eligible for student loans from banking). Actually in most cases, they are BOTH very talented and with good financial family background. \n\nSo please don't confuse international STEM students with somebody  suffering a poor life back in their hometown and therefore have no other choice but to came to U.S and be willing to take whatever they are given just to stay. STEM students don't come to U.S for survival, instead they came for widening their eyesight, meeting potential \"business partner\", and challenging themselves with the best (and also the most expensive) education world can offer. They see U.S an exciting stage where they are learn from world-class professors, work for world-class companies, and meet with world-class successful people. And please remember this is not because U.S is just granted with most talented people but because it is country capable to ATTRACT those talented people from all over the world. After STEM students graduate, as I have indicated before, they usually get employed (and work for like 10 hours a day...) for those most big names in Wall Street and Silicon Valley who offers great salaries much HIGHER than the U.S average salaries, or sometimes they even start their own companies which can only produce more employment opportunities for U.S or they don't even bother to find a job (not mentioning a low paid job...) because of their family abundance.\n\nWithout OPT and OPT extension, many of these STEM students who currently under employment will be forced to get out of the country, for which I personally could not see anything but a great loss. Many big companies will need to waste a HUGE amount of money and time to rehire for those empty positions after they left given the assumption that they might be finally able to find someone else qualified (as an other side note, companies usually need to interview dozens to hundreds of applicants before they find someone qualified and be willing to take the job at the same time). With burden as heavy as that, I seriously suspect whether some start ups will just go bankrupt right away. Also, with the message of OPT extension being revoked spread out, I would imagine much fewer students would like to come to U.S for education, for which I just could see a bigger damage to U.S universities than to those STEM students. Some STEM students reject equivalent juicy offer from also prestigious universities from say Japan and UK just because they have the \"American Dream\". Many STEM students, if not come to U.S, will also have not bad employment somewhere else (but of course U.S still able to offer better and that's why they chose U.S).  However on the other hand don't forget that U.S universities are earning 3-4X higher tuition from international students than from domestics equivalence, and for many years especially during the economy regression from 2008 to 2013, international students have been contributing a huge revenue for many U.S universities for which many domestic families cannot afford. \n\nAt the other hand regarding H1B, yes they are current some problems with it that some (mostly Indian) outsourcing companies are abusing the system to smuggle their native workers to U.S and stealing jobs away by cheaper salaries. I really don't want to blame those smuggled workers as by common sense, no one would like to leave their hometown just to take lower-than-average salaries unless they really have no other better options. However as the most important stand point I have been restating over and over, I really want people to separate them out from OPT/OPT extension program, as the nature of OPT and OPT extension will guarantee that the problem of current H1B system will never be applicable to OPT program.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xinwei Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12408", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is good rule for america.

Currently, I am working at Honeywell in the Performance Materials Technology division using OPT. In my current role, I developed kinetic models for various technologies such as hydroprocessing and fluidized catalytic cracking to produce gasoline. \n\nForeign students represent half of all U.S. graduate enrollments in engineering, math, and computer science. There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Masters degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by extending the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees to longer period 24 months to get the new rule pass the law as soon as possible.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fuyue  Li, Honeywell UOP", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1558", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:\n1.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n   It Gives employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n      Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said (in a letter to President Obama):\n     \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    The proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n      John Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n      the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n    \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n      Richard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n     \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n    \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans.

In a country like the United States, the last thing I ever want to do is to say no to great talents.\n\nOPT is an extension for the American dream.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nPurpose of the Regulatory Action\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is nobody's definition of temporary. As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students.\n{NOTE: U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.}\nWHY IN THE H ARE  U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVIEGED PROGRAM, BECAUSE OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATES WANT TO DESTROY THIS NATION.

While most entrepreneurs are chasing profits, before they reduce cost they should first create value.  Larry Ellison of Oracle said it best when saying, \"When you innovate, you've got to be prepared for everyone telling you you're nuts.\"\nTechnology markets especially are brutally competitive and relentless in their innovation. You have to innovate. If you're in a profitable market, you can be certain that someone else wants a piece of it, if not all of it. You never know where your competition is going to come from-whether a large multinational or a two- person startup, your enemies or your partners, within or outside your industry. You need to keep innovating in a way that makes your product increasingly valuable to your customers. Adding features and \"neat\" technology for their own sake rarely helps you-your technical innovations may be exceptional, but may not mean much to your customers. Again, value is in the customer's eye, not the vendor's. so you need to try, of course it could fail, it is still possible you could success. All this need qualified tech people to realize. \n\nUS has attract many students to further their study. Why push them away to other competitors when you have dedicated to teaching them? you always know the smart brain is limited sources.\n\nIf we could not give extension to foreign stem students, Universities, especially public one,  will collect less tuitions from foreign students.

For the employers, they definitely want to keep their employee as long as possible instead of being forced spending money again on finding a new guy after the OPT 12-month. So the 24-month OPT extension would benefit both the employers and the employees.\nI believe a wise company would consider every aspect before they hire an OPT student. Those OPT students who get hired have already proven their value to the company as well as to the country. They deserve an opportunity to work longer in the US to contribute more to the prosper of the country.

Wrong. In fact, international students are MORE EXPENSIVE to hire. Visa and residency sponsorships cost a lot of money, time, and resources. Furthermore, the employer also risks wasting another tens of thousands of dollars training this person, because in a couple of years, he/she has a good chance of quitting the job due to the H1B lottery. These costs way outweigh the social security taxes, etc. mentioned by some people.\nSecond, some people think that it's easier for international students to get jobs. Very wrong. They have to go through the exact same interview process as American students. In fact, most companies at a career fair do NOT consider international students at all, due to the complex sponsorship processes and hefty fees.\nThird, some people think that the US government is putting international students before Americans. This is even more wrong. While in college, international students are NOT allowed to take any off-campus jobs. Their on-campus work hours are also strictly limited by law. Furthermore, they are NOT eligible for any work-study jobs at all. All these restrictions are in place to protect American students' opportunities.\nThe international students who can overcome these disadvantages and challenges are the strongest and brightest. They are the top candidates in their fields. They help numerous US companies produce high-quality, robust, and defect-free technical work, making the USA stay ahead of its competitors. If we lose these invaluable assets, we will see more competitor nations rising and catching up with the USA. The continuous contributions of these bright individuals not only make America stronger, but also make America wealthier, which in return provides all American citizens with nice houses, cars, healthcare, education, and welfare. US unemployment and homeless have nothing to do with STEM OPT students, since these students only take highly-demanding, highly-challenging jobs, not the average American worker's job. Millions of illegal immigrants are the ones that take Americans' jobs on a massive scale. In fact, plenty of international students become entrepreneurs later on that create jobs for Americans. For example, Min Kao founded Garmin, creating tons of jobs for Americans!\nThe real problem we should worry about is, the many fraudulent \"universities\" and \"companies\" that are involved in visa frauds. This is the problem that we need to track down and stop, to safeguard a healthy, positive environment for both Americans and qualified international students.\nNow you should have a better understanding of the whole picture. If you want to make America great, then you want to support this new proposed rule.\nAll the best to you, and let's make America greater, stronger.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10817", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a very good initiative attracting the brightest students to study and live in U.S.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alan Jin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19735", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I have a PhD in Engineering and I believe that allowing this rule to pass does not benefit American STEM graduates.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n \nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. \nThe OPT STEM Extension is EXTREMLY Important for STEM Employers and US Economy\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest techniques in the field and succeed in global market. For example, in the company that I am currently doing practical training, there are a good number of students, mostly from Europe and Asia, making significant contribution to our product. Most of these international students are some of the smartest people from their home country and are dedicated to make our product successful. With the additional help from international students, we can meet all the deadlines and publish all new features for our customer. Our product is extremely popular around the world and the revenue of the company is growing steadily.  I cannot imagine how our team can meet all the deadlines without hiring international students. We are constantly hiring and there are not enough qualified people although our HR tried very hard in recruiting. It is not a matter of competition of jobs between international students and domestic workers in high-tech industry. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to find enough work forth to truly change the world. In addition, it  will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students are connections with other countries which can be valuable in the future. In the days of globalization, connections are opportunities.  I have seen people from different cultures making amazing things happen when it comes to assisting growth of company in other parts of the world. In fact, as an immigration country, US have always been benefited by the variety of people from all over the world. Thus, OPT STEM extension is important for current and potential growth of US economy.\n \n24 Months' Extension is Crucial for students in High-Tech Industry to gain Enough Experience\n \nThe learning curve of the core product in most high-tech companies is usually very steep. With 3 years of OPT, students in tech-industry can gain enough experience to make more significant contribution to the company and to US economy. It is a win-win strategy for US citizen and international student. \n \nConclusion\n \nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n \nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n \nSincerely,\nQi Lu\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qi Lu", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4141", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I don't know how many times we need to emphasize that the unemployment is nothing to do with a small number of STEM international students.

Americas most prominent and successful companies hire thousands of international STEM graduates from US universities. We provide a ton of value to the economy. Most of us stay on once our H1B visa gets selected in the lottery, and we provide a lot of long-term benefit to American companies.\n\n2. The H1B lottery has a low success rate. Not passing the STEM extension would give us only one attempt towards getting the visa. I didnt get selected in the lottery this year. By simple probability, we need at least three attempts to be guaranteed an H1B visa.\n\n3. The OPT STEM extension is a great way to attract the brightest minds from around the world to study at American universitiesvery few students would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to come study at American universities if it didnt guarantee at least 2.5 years of practical training at the end.\n\n4. International students like us are not stealing American jobs. I work for a top tech company as a Software Engineer, and I can tell you firsthand that it is extremely difficult to attract, hire and retain top STEM talent. There simply arent enough Americans who can do STEM jobs. Most, if not all international US university STEM grads who work here end up being successful in their career. This, in turn, creates a lot more jobs for Americans and internationals alike. If Im successful and bring a lot of value to my company, it will generate more revenue for the company, and they can use that to grow their organization. Therefore it is a win-win situation for everybody.\n\n5. As an engineer at a top tech company, I pay tens of thousands of dollars in tax to Uncle Sam every year. I also spend tens of thousands of dollars to live in the US. Not incentivizing us to stay in the country will only cause us to find greener pastures elsewhereI could get a job as a Software Engineer at a company abroad, and contribute to their economythis would mean loss of taxes to the US government, among other things.\n\n6. In President Obamas wordsMore fundamentally, the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are going through the process of immigrating legally. In theory, if I wanted to become an American citizen, I would need to wait 18.5 years(2 years for H1B, 11 years for Green Card, 5.5 years for citizenship). Compare this to ~6 years if you illegally walked across the US border.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would like for the USCIS to not only pass this rule, but also consider expanding H1B visa availability for STEM graduates of US universities. We were trained by your professors (most of whom were immigrants themselves), and we spent thousands of dollars coming to America to get access to opportunity and provide a lot of value in return. We need to bring reform to this broken immigration system. Highly skilled immigrant workers like myself should not have to struggle through the various hoops of the immigration system remain in this country.\n\nScripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a strangerwe were strangers once, too. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.President Obama\n\nThank you,\nAniruddh Chaturvedi", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Aniruddh Chaturvedi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2201", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be harmful to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates.

I've seen lots of comments that they are taking jobs from us - true, but they are also the people who could create more jobs. \n\nWhat makes the United States of America the greatest country in the world is that we open to well-trained, knowledgeable and talented scientists and engineers all over the world (including celebrities like Albert Einstein and many Nobel laureates) and have them work for us in the past over 100 years - and we should keep it that way. Sometimes we may think technology immigrants are taking a share from our cake, but we shall not ignore that they are a major contributing factor to make our cake larger, for everyone in United States. \n\nEuropean countries fear immigrants would take job opportunities, so they shut their doors. Are they doing better now? I don't think so. Technology immigration definitely provides more locomotive to our economy than the population burden associated. They are helping Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Boeing, Goodyear, DuPont, GE, P&G and many others be the best companies in the world, and what they are doing are not easily replaced by domestic workers.\n\nThat being said, remember the \"optional training program\" is not even an immigration program. It merely keep those international graduates for a couple of years, not sufficient to grant any immigration, but an opportunity to let our universities, national laboratories, and companies to pick the best out of them to benefit our business, our organizations and our education. Still, 90% of the graduates, those who were not picked, will be kicked out US after the program finishes. This program gives us a channel to keep the best scientists and engineers with so little cost, which I think is a super sweet deal.

We take nearly a million immigrants every year and unfortunately there is only a few percent are those of \"best quality\".

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.

Below are a variety of examples to support this claim.  Please respond intelligently to each point.\n\n1.  Information obtained from the Center for immigration studies has revealed that prior to the proposed expansion the existing OPT program has already denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs between the years 2009-2013.  Why OPT or even expand OPT if there are qualified American workers that can fill the open positions?\n\n2.  OPT has removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.  Why OPT or even expand OPT if the program continues to damage the Medicare and Social Security trust funds?\n\n3. The original purpose of OPT was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned, but today it is used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the US and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. The proposed DHS rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.  OPT cannot be expanded and should be completely defunded as the program and the proposed new rule continues to not work as intended.\n\n4. There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the United States in addition 98,000 in the 12-month OPT programs and 30,000in 29 month OPT programs.  Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.  OPT should defunded and the proposed new rule denied as American workers are being undermined by the OPT pool.\n\n5. Those in the OPT pool are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger and therefore cheaper for employers to hire than their American competitors.  Employers save over 7.5% when they hire students instead of American workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program.  OPT workers mostly hold jobs that pay in the range of $60,000 to $90,000 per year range, which costs Social Security about $1 billion dollars per year.  OPT workers already have an unfair advantage over American workers.  It therefore makes no sense to further expand the OPT program.  OPT should be completely de-funded.\n\n6.  By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years, which is the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid, OPT has been established a defacto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.  Expansion of OPT therefore should not be considered.\n\n7. A March 2014 GAO report found that the existing OPT program is full of inefficiencies, susceptible fraud and lack of oversight.  Under these circumstances it makes not sense to expand OPT.\n\n8. The same 2014 GAO report noted that OPT is causing a major national security problem because the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that \"ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\" Under these circumstances it makes no sense to expand OPT as proposed.\n\n9. The proposed rule effectively requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.  The proposed rule requires these organizations to setup mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT, but there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit. Explain how the proposed rule makes sense under these circumstances.\n\n10. If the United States indeed needs the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do the OPT students need training?\n\n11. If workers with such training are needed why won't these special mentoring be open to Americans?\n\n12.  OPT expands the pool of young workers and this allows companies to legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers which are much cheaper that American workers.  This gives OPT workers an unfair advantage.  Explain how the expansion of OPT will remedy this problem?\n\n13. OPT is causing declining job prospects for qualified American students.  For example, in 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%. The proposed rule will cause further declines in job prospects for American students and graduates.  This is unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mike Strandell", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5004", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Strongly support OPT extension.

First, foreign students need to fill lots of documents to apply for the OPT. Second, any company hiring F-1 students have to confirm the status of foreign students are legal. If any company violate the rule, they might be punished. Why do they take a risk to hire a foreign student without legal status? Moreover, there are many rules in the new OPT extension rule to prevent this thing happen. Not only foreign students are benefited from this new rule, but also universities, companies, the society and US citizens.\n\nHope more people support this good rule!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuheng Zhan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21429", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "America is the best country in the world and that's why talents from all over the world come to study, live, contribute to the great America.

So the new rule will tremendously impact my life in the near future. But still I want to present my supportive opinion as objectively as possible.\n\nAs most of Americans know, the manufacturing sector of US economy has experienced a substantial job loss in the last decades. The unemployment in industry is not due to the competition from international students, but the shrinkage of manufacturing industry itself, which most STEM students work in. The cause of the shrinkage has its historical cause, the Bretton Woods system, which ensured Americans enjoying imported products at a cheaper price. But in order to maintain the benefits, it requires consistent innovation and industry upgrading. However, most talented US students nowadays choose not to major in STEM, for overwork and underpay (a sign of reduced competitiveness). This, in turn, will hasten the death of US manufacturing. This is the reason why US needs international students to replenish talents in industry, to make industry more competitive and back to the original track. This is the last chance for US to revive industry, otherwise in next few decades, it will lose competition against other countries as well as leading position in the world. But at this time I still consider US as the best land for innovation due to its spirit and system, and still believe that it has the chance.\n\nFor the above reason, I am supportive of the new rule to expand training opportunities for international students with STEM degrees, especially for those with advanced degrees. However, we must gain immediate attention to any behaviors that abuse these rules, for example, it is noticed that every year more than half of H1-B visas were used by a few companies, which play like employment agencies and directly hire people oversea with falsified resumes. Such behaviors undermine fair competition and cause further damage to STEM education and manufacturing industry in US. Therefore, while we expand the opportunities for international students in US, we must heavily regulate the companies who are directly hiring oversea.\n\nThe United State is a great nation of immigrants.

They have brought about their culture to us and this is how Americans work. We are a country that welcome everyone.\nIt is not true that these group of people will steal the jobs from local Americans. The job type splits and there is no conflict. They are mostly majoring in the tech areas where most of local American do not like to learn. And when we look at the employment records from each universities and colleges, it would be easier to find that local citizens or green card people are much easier than these OPT students to get a job even if their GPA or other performance are not so good as these group of people. Therefore, we cannot conclude that OPT students steal the Americans jobs. Instead, they contribute more and devote more of their effort to earn a job that most of local citizens cannot take or do not like to take. And they together form a society that help to promote the growth of the U.S economy.\nI strongly encourage the extension of the rule, which will benefit the U.S for in the long term and draw more and more people overseas to study in this country and make the country stronger.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jin  Zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21416", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students are very necessary.  our country need lots of labor, also we need developing economy. nonimmigrant students can do this help. they wanna find a job, they are also good customers. all these will help our country.  i support it!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ryan Forest", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5756", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a really good proposal, which is beneficial to the US government and academic sector.\n\nStatistics shows that every year foreign students bring the US government huge amount of income.

International students in STEM majors are the smartest and most talented students in their home country. They work so hard and put the skills that they have learned from university into practice. It definitely will benefit development of US economy. Extending OPT will help US attract more talents in area of high technology. Please pay attention: it is not for all the internationals, just for STEM majors. Second, OPT extension will not fight against American U.S. born citizens. Only when a society is well competitive and strong, it will create more job opportunities. Only when a country welcome and cherish these STEM talented students, it can be more competitive and strong enough. The relationship of STEM internationals and U.S. born citizens is not to fight against in chaos, but to work together to make American a better and strong country. Not only our generation, but also our next generations will be proud of what we do today. It should not limit to race, color, and where you come from. To fulfill American dream, we should open our door and respect all the people who make contribution to US. OPT extension is not a green card, not a citizenship for STEM students. It is only an opportunity for these smart student in high-tech to use what they have learned to contribute US economy. Third, this OPT extension is very important for students, employees and employers. Today, there are many international students in STEM in high-tech companies. And they get trained and do a great job in company that can bring huge profit to their company. Canceling the OPT extension is great loss for these companies.

Qualified international students majoring in STEM subjects should stay longer in the country as this can continously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. Additionally, U.S. has a long history of immigration history since before the Declaration of Independence. Out immigration friendly policy makes the country strong and thriving for decades if not centuries. The dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by thousands of prior immigrants in STEM coming from all over the world. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industrial and technological development could not have been possible. For example, Professor Jayant Baliga from NCSU was an Indian immigrant in the 1970s, who made dramatically contribution in the power industry, which results in huge cost savings to consumers, and reduction of world-wide carbon dioxide emissions. More detailed information can be found in the following link:\nhttp://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/how-b-jayant-baliga-transformed-power-semiconductors\n\n2. The diversity of the society is indispensable . Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain public voices from different perspectives. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings. Diversity of cultures can also prevent biased or partial collective opionions and behaviors in this country.\n\n3. Some argue that those international students create intensively bad competition for Americans, which is not true. In fact, healthy competition is a good thing in a long run. The competion can push majority of our citizens to enhance and increase their skills and gives our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. As we know, citizens already have a natural edge when competing with foreigners because of cultural, linguistical and other reasons. Also, they do not need sponsorship and they have language advantage.

Along with the increase in poverty issues have come a desperate daily status quo of unending behavior issues. \n\nThe situation is increasingly aggravated by a community inability to fund school operations and expansions due to the lack of taxing capacity by the parents of the 60+ percent receiving free and reduced lunches.\n\nI have watched the decreasing ability of my students to graduate from high school, along with the decreasing ability of those who have graduated from high school, and those who have gone on to complete college, to secure jobs with a live-able wage. More and more of our students are looking at a future with retail jobs, McDonald-type jobs, landscape maintenance, car sales and unable to find any manufacturing jobs, technical jobs or professional positions.\n\nAccording to my data we have been experiencing the largest immigration wave in US history since the middle 1980s at the same time as US corporations have outsourced an increasing percentage of our manufacturing sector, wages and salaries have been static or dropping and the functional unemployment or under-employment rate has climbed to a very real 15-25% of our total adult population. Adults in their 40-50 in the middle class have lost well-paying jobs that allowed them to pay for their children to get productive skills have watched not only their own jobs terminated, down-sized or scaled back to part-time, and increasingly our young people have become unable to get a decent paid job.\n\nIt is completely unethical for the Obama Administration to allow an increasing number of foreign students to overstay their educational visas, or have them extended to work legally in the US at a time when employable workers already living in the US are unemployed, under-employed of part-timed in double digit numbers. This practice by global corporations should not be allowed. The further insult that the proposal does not require adequate immigration supervision, or E-Verify documentation by employers, to prevent overstaying, establishment of permanent immigration status by pregnancy or marriage to a native-born citizen is completely criminal and unethical.\n\nAs a public school teacher I cannot support this proposal in any way to increase the numbers or the time for foreign students to be allowed to work in the US after graduation from US educational institutions; they need to return to their own countries and help their own communities develop and become stable and prosperous. It's not ethical to allow the immigration system to increase their stay in the face of the decades long high and increasing unemployment and underemployment.

I believe in the following reasons:\n\nFor decades, the United States is deemed as the land of opportunities because it provides talented people a ground to pursuit their dreams despite which part of the world they are coming from. It is important to keep the doors opened to talented students after they graduate to find their opportunities despite their races and nationalities. Discontinued OPT regulation will lose many talented people and cause a bad impact to the US job market. Imagine all the international students that are in the work force right now are all gone, many of the companies will have a hard time to immediately find the suitable people, which causes a huge bad impact on the US economy. In the long-term, since many talented people are gone because of the discontinuation of the OPT program, the US job market will not be as competitive as before and the average salary will tend to decrease. Also, since it becomes more difficult to find talented people in the US, jobs will shift to other countries that could provide more talents. In the long run, there can also be a chance that international students may want to pursuit their degrees in other countries than the US that could provide more job opportunities after graduation. International students pay a large amount of tuition fee compared to local students. If all the US universities lose many international students, it could impact the US economy as well. \n\nIn contrast, the new amendment for extending OPT duration for STEM degree students will have a lot of benefits to the United States. This program could attract talented students around the world to pursuit degrees from prestigious schools in the US and maintaining the high rankings for US universities. The extended program allows talented students to have more time to find a job and contribute more to the US workforce. If they tend to work for longer years, it allows them more sufficient time to apply for H1B VISAs. The US job market will remain competitive which could attract more talents around the world. Companies can get good workers and continue to gain good revenues because of high quality products produced by high quality workers. The US economy will continue to prosper as long as the country collects the most talented people around the globe to stay and work in America. \n\nI sincerely hope that this proposal for extending OPT students will pass so that talented students around the world can have a chance to continue their dreams after they graduate. This can also help the US to keep top talents in the field of science and engineering in the job market.

Having diverse racial and ethnic groups help company have more opportunities to find creative ideas from international students, especially talented students who are in STEM majors.\n\nMore importantly, talented international STEM students will help companies understand the demands of their home countries and expand the business of the companies to China, India and some other countries. China and India have the largest population in the world. They are rich resource for companies in the future.

BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at Compsys, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nHope more people support this good rule!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by ENMeng Yan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21926", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this 24 OPT stem extension rule.

I believe it will benefit US economy as well as science and technology. Here are my arguments.\n\nFirst, most international STEM students have paid or are paying a lot of tuition to US universities. According to the USNews report (http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/07/report-33-percent-of-international-students-in-stem-fields), there are around 350,000 international students who are pursuing STEM degrees. Based on the number from another article (http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2013/11/11/us-sees-record-number-of-international-college-students), students from abroad are contributing more than $24 billion per year to the US economy, It is a significant amount of money, which has been used to improve numerous academic programs in US universities other than STEM, and to establish scholarships for US citizens. The STEM program attracts talents and money from the global, which has built an effective ecosystem for the US education and economy. It is a win-tin strategy. If the STEM program is eliminated, international students will not be willing to come here. It's truly a loss to the US.\n\nSecond, some people may say those large amount of international students are going to take their jobs if the STEM program exists. It is totally wrong. The STEM program only allows international students to gain off-campus experience in a specific area that is closely related to their major of study for a FIXED period. It serves as part of the university education, not a work permit at all. If internationals students are willing to work in the US, they have to apply H1B visas. Each year, there are only 65,000 H1B visas granted. Given such a small number, I do not think it will have any negative impact on the US job market. In fact, according to the statistics from the US Department of Labor, the recent unemployment rate has reached a historic low record (http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000). It is a clear evidence that the STEM program has nothing to do with the job market of US citizens.\n\nThird, international STEM students contribute to the US science and technology. Most STEM students are studying in accredited US universities and institutions. They have received extensive training and have the skills required by many US companies. They brings in ideas, hard-working, and most importantly, diversity, to US companies. These are key factors that make a company grow, and strengthen the leading position in science and technology of the US. If the STEM program is gone, those talented students will go back to their countries, apply their knowledge learned in the US, become competitors against the US. It's not what the US people want to see.\n\nAnd finally, I would like to point out the real reason to the complaints from some people who said they lost their jobs due to foreign workers. It is because some companies are outsourcing their work to other countries. If an international STEM student wants to work in the US, except for applying work permit, his/her job has to meet the minimum wage set for internationals workers, which is a few times higher than the national minimum wage. So a company will never try to hire an international STEM student to save money. However, they will hire a lot of workers directly from another country who can accept incredibly low salary to do the same work and are not required to have work permits. Those workers are not international STEM students; they have never came to the US or received US education. The US govt should have more regulations against those companies who are abusing the outsourcing system, not international STEM students. Firing at the STEM program is totally a wrong direction and will not help at all.\n\nI would like reiterate that I strongly support this proposal. It will benefit our nation.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Roberta Mollema", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15340", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Mr. Obama you're killing the the Democratic party with your pro Illegal policy and your anti American action, after the Nov. 2016 election there will not be no Democratic party to go back to.

This will lead to negative impacts toward both economic condition and industrial growth.\n\nFrom industry perspective, creating jobs from multiple sources of working forces will obviously stimulate development of markets. Introduction of diversity benefits industries in expansion and growth, as well as culture.\n\nFrom companies' perspective, it is reasonable for companies to hire the best of the best without a question regardless where the sources are from. Forcing companies to change the hiring process though political pressure runs contrary to both competition equality and corporation growth. According to http://www.cnet.com/news/google-foreign-workers-are-key-to-our-success/,\nnot only Google, other big heads IT companies need QUALIFIED work forces to bolster and support their services.\n\nThe argument that companies tend to foreign workers with discounted pay does not stand its point. According to http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/08/10/best-paying-companies-115k/31303639/, at least for tech industry, big companies offer relatively competitive salary to along with their growth. For the big companies that are also big heads in applications for H1 visas each year, they pay foreign employers just as much as citizen workers. The employers know the right wage for right skills. Necessity comes before money. Thus, false facts invalidate this argument.\n\nThe arguments regarding job stealing rely on a certain doubtful assumption that the existence of foreigners themselves is the reason that causes unemployment of some citizens. The real reason behind the change in the structure of employment in U.S. is market changes. These changes make companies raise different skills requirements and increase turnover rate. As illustrated in last paragraph, companies only ask for human resources with the right skills. In this case, competence comes before filling. Employment of foreigners is only an aspect of the outcome of these changes. Restraining the time for foreigners to work as an attempt to overturn the changes through policy pressure will not only have little effect toward but also negatively impact economy of the U.S. Thus, improper reverse argument renders itself unconvincing as it stands.\n\nIn sum, the proposal boosts the possibility of potential growth of American technology and raises contributions made by multiple kinds of working forces.

Got some news about canceling OPT extension for F1 and felt so bad about this decision. It's an exciting news to see this proposal.\n\nFirst, it is one of significant reasons to choose United States for overseas education, not others. I'm a F-1 student, and I made a choice to study here for 2 reasons: education in US is outstanding all over the world; and it cares about  hands-on experience a lot in a program. Because of OPT and OPT extension, international students, in STEM related fields, have enough time to gain their experience with academic knowledge. Say there's no OPT extension, international students only get 1-year to work in their major related fields, which will not seem appealing any more. As a result, people tend to study in other countries, not here.  As we know, tuition of international students is several times higher than natives fee. In this scenario, the number of international students drops dramatically, which will bring significant decrease on education income even on entire American economy.\n\nIt speeds up development of relative fields(such as technology) in U.S with the help of OPT extension. Many companies(Google, Apple, Facebook, etc) needs STEM majored students to make contribution to products. For international students, they need valid visa to work in U.S. If theres no OPT extension, international employees can only stay here with H1B(We all know that it is pretty hard to get visa lottery selected). Those employees have to leave if they dont get H1B so that itll cause the shortage of staff. To handle the issue, companies need more people to cover those positions, but it is not a good alternative: first, it is hard to hire people without sacrificing hiring bars, secondly, it takes time to ramp up for new employees. The similar thing will happen next year. Someone will propose that its not a problem if they dont hire f1. However, it is a terrible suggest: company only cares about if a person is a good fit, rather than checking out whether he/she is F1 or not. It is NOT FAIR to say NO to candidates only because they dont have US citizenship. \n\nMoreover, it shows diversity in U.S if this proposal is approved. U.S is well-known for its open and diversity. I feel disappointed if U.S holds on OPT extension rejection, it is like: No, you dont belong here, leave here asap. It doesnt make sense to say I deserve a job and wage, because Im a citizen. As a foreigner, I work hard to get a job opportunity here, and now Im told you must leave here because you are not eligible. If it comes true, it means that no American dreams any more.

The reasons are as follows:\n\n1. The reason why America is the strongest nation in the world lies on the fact that there are numerous talented immigrants who devote themselves to building this nation. The OPT policy will undoubtedly attract more and more students to come here and keep this nation prosperous;\n\n2. I am working in a pharmaceutical company now where I dealt with a lot of stuff about cGMP manufacturing. By working here, I learned a lot of regulatory so that I am able to bring what I learned here back to my own country and they can better cooperate with American pharmaceutical companies in the future, which I believe will do a lot of good to American economy;\n\n3. America is always a great country that is tolerant and keep opening up to the world. I believe this is a very important part of America core value. By having a chance to work here for a couple of years after graduation, the students will get more opportunities to know about the America spirit and its core values better so that they are able to spread it to their own countries, from which both America and other countries will benefit a lot;\n\n4. If the OPT policy is cancelled now, a lot of talented people who are currently working in the US have to terminate their employment. This sudden unplanned change will not only affect the foreign students, but more importantly, will definitely have a really negative impact on the companies here as well as the US economy. As a result, cancelling this policy is undoubtedly a unwise decision;\n\n5. I strongly believe that competition is always the force to make people moving forward. Without the competition from the talented foreign students, there is much less force to keep the American peer proceeding and improving themselves. The reason that makes the river clear is that it keeps receiving the fresh water from outside, if the communication from outside is shut off, the water will go bad very fast and no lives is going to survive in it.

STEM extension program is a great incentive to attract highly skilled talents from the globe and maintaining Americans pioneering status in high tech fields. It is horrible to see all these negative comments immersing the page that are mostly 1. Pointless, rage of emotion; 2. Biased; 3. Contradict to the fact.\nCompanies want to pay less taxes or to hire cheap employees? A lot of high tech company, if behaved professionally, will not ever ask for candidates immigration status before they made hiring decision. How could they weigh that factor when they give a foreign candidate a job offer? Also, a position in STEM field is usually not cheap. And there isnt much difference between what native and foreign employees in the same level get paid for. Again, it is impossible to weigh that factor when making their hiring decisions.\nForeigners are squeezing away American workers? Usually, natives have better communication skills over foreigners so when it comes to getting a job, most foreigners are actually falling behind. Same as natives, foreigners need to go through fierce struggle for job, and some of them won simply because they present a solid quality that a company wants, and is also needed by the society, by a nation that is willing to attract the best talents regardless of their nationality. Immigration status shouldnt become a barricade for companies to pick up the best candidates, and it is also unfair for Americans to blame foreigners to cause their unemployment.\nThey also made a mistake in who benefit most from STEM extension, not workers, but students! Most foreigners who are under OPT initially came to US to study, not to work or live. The availability to receive extended practical training in worlds best industries is a great advantage over other countries educational programs. Without it, US will no longer attract so many good student all over the globe who then will be  unable to devote themselves into high technology industries that is part of the USs core competitive strength.\nTo conclude, the STEM extension program is not a deprive-your-job program, but a program that helps to maintain Americans immigration spirit: to attract the best talents in the world. The original 12 months OPT after graduation is definitely too short for those students who requires more practical experience in high tech industries, while this 24 months extension is a great add up to make to long enough. Please, officials, do not let those Youtube like comments affect your judgement that will jeopardize the development of this country. We need a full vision on this issue before making decisions and I strongly believe we should approve this proposal.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ziyi Yang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12194", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I work at higher education and fully support extending the F-1 OPT to 24months.

The reason they gave in extending their F-1 student visa status was to allow the students to gain on-the-job-learning.\nMy understanding is that by hiring these graduates, companies do not have to deduct Social Security and Medicare taxes from these employees  a savings of $12,000 per year. \nUnless these employers can prove that they cannot find U.S. college graduates, with STEM Degrees, we are creating an unfair hiring advantage to alien graduates over our very own college graduates. This is a terrible plan!\nImmigration policies should be for our countrys benefit not to encourage the  hiring of aliens over our own unemployed citizens. According to the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Sarah R. Saldaa, Our nation will benefit from keeping international students here, educated in U.S. colleges and universities here while they receive additional training, rather than sending them out of the country. At the same time, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by U.S. educated-STEM students, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries.  \nWe are not talking about students who have business degrees in their native countries; we are talking about high school graduates who are not required to have previous STEM working experience in their native countries before they enter our colleges or universities. We are not sending them out of the country; we are giving them an educational STEM Degree and letting them return to their own countries to enhance their own countries business communities. At the same time our colleges and universities are charging out of state tuition fees.\n\nI ask myself, Who benefits under this program? First the foreign students benefit because they get a college degree in STEM and on the job training with a mentor for three years while they are being paid. They also get experience in our business community and marketplace. Secondly their foreign countries  benefit because when the students return, they have STEM educated students with three years of practical experience in STEM companies. Finally our STEM businesses benefit because they get employees at a cost benefit of $36,000 for three years.\nNow, who doesnt benefit? First qualified U.S. students who have to compete for jobs against alien students who save the hiring companies $36,000. These are students, most likely with student loans, trying to enter a job market that already has millions of other students graduating with not nearly enough jobs waiting for them. Secondly our countrys Social Security and Medicare Programs loose taxes that would have been collected from U.S. citizen student graduates working in those jobs.\n\nThe only reason for this program extension should be allowed is if the companies hiring these students can prove that they cannot get qualified U.S. citizen graduates for these jobs. To prevent companies from entering this program just to get cheap labor, they should have to pay the students the same pay scale that a U.S. student would have gotten for the same job and charge the student an on the job training/mentoring  fee of $12,000.00 per year. The fee would go onto our Social Security and Medicare Programs. Otherwise these students are being exploited by the companies to obtain cheap labor at our own college graduates expense.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lorraine Humes", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2796", "postedDate": "2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "US became the innovation power house it is today because of its embracing gesture towards foreign talents.

I do not want to post any data to help prove my perspective on the larger picture as the statistics can be collected in a biased way or interpreted in deliberation to prove any other point.\n\nAnd to those citizens who feel like their jobs have been stolen by foreigners: hiring process can be personal, it's only about whether the people who hire you wants to work with you or not, and whether you are qualified for the position.\n\nTo those who think foreign STEM students are costing taxpayer's money and leave them in worse financial situation: these students pay full tuition with their own money, and drive up consumption demand when they are living in the States, with their own money.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\nOur laws are supposed to be for the good of American.  Stop hurting us!

Nowadays we can see US high-tech companies are hiring many F-1 students and they truly made great contributions to the US. According to the survey, they are creating huge revenues to the US and benefiting the US job market. Also, all these revenues will be partially converted to tax and eventually benefit every US citizen here. On the other hand, it provides good opportunities to the international students who achieved or will achieve their degrees in the US to apply what they have learned to the US industry.\n\nIn the long term, this rule will attract more and more high-tech international students come to US and this will bring great benefits to both education and industry in the US. Also, we know competition accelerates development, diversity is one of the most important factors which makes the United States the best country in the world. Competition will continue pushing the development of high-tech technologies and kepp US the center of technologies around the world in the future. Silicon Valley's success is a great example of this.\n\nMost oppositions argued that STEM students are taking their jobs and causing unemployment of US citizens. This is not true at all. First, this rule is only for high-tech students and there are restrictions on that. STEM students' jobs have to be directly related to their degrees. Secondly, STEM students are working for high-tech companies and these companies mostly require highly educated employees. And US job market doesn't have enough this kind of people to fill these gaps. So even if STEM students leave the US this won't cause any job losing issue but actually cause the lack of talents in the US industry. Finally, let's assume this rule is cancelled, that will only harm US job market and it will not help under-qualified people get a job. \n\nI took my degree in the US and I am currently working here. I saw many STEM students come to US with the \"American Dream\" including me. They finished their degrees and some of them choose to work in the US after school. I saw them working hard and made great contributions to their companies. But in recent years the probability of getting H1B visa is becoming lower and lower. This rule is probably the only way to continue working in the US for STEM students. Actually many other coutries like China and India are developing rapidly in high-tech areas and they are building high-tech centers like Sillcon Valley in the US. Nowadays more and more STEM students choose to go back to their countries. If this rule fails, the United States will be in the risk of losing not only revenues, talents, but also competitiveness in the high-tech areas in the future. \n\nThe United States is a great country and many achievements are created by immigrants.

This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months and It would be great if increased 12 more months. In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests. This will help us in making our career path fruitful.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained. Given that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this comment, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

The 24-month OPT extension is also necessary for a graduate to finish a project before he leaves America. It's unfair for international students if you charge us high tuition but don't give us opportunities to gain practical training experience. I'm also astounded to see such overwhelming hostility against foreigners in the comments.\n\nThe OPT program has a time limit. It's not a job visa program nor its a immigration program. People will leave after they finish this 1-year or 3-year program if they didn't get a job visa. In the long term, the job opportunities in US taken by foreigners are those taken by the job visa holders rather than the international student graduates.\n\nI also doubt if the United States can educate enough qualified student to fulfill the need of the job market for high-tech job positions. At least in my school, about half of the student who attended computer science classes are Chinese and Indians. We are only interested in the part of the US job market that the Americans can't fulfill the need of. We don't intend to take away any other job opportunities.\n\nI chose to come to study in the United States partly because I was promised this OPT opportunity then. I would be disappointed at this country and its hostility against foreigners if this program was revoked. Again, for my own interests, for what this country promised, I strongly support this rule.

If you dont give international STEM students a reasonable time to get a H1B visa via lottery, they will have no choice but go back to make contribution to their own countries, which will harm US interest and benefit the competitors.\n\nSecond, international STEM student are not stealing on job opportunities from US citizens. It is well known that US are short on STEM workers. Without highly skilled international STEM students, these tech companies will face a shortage in hiring tech workers, eventually, they will have no choice but go seeking for skilled workers overseas and move part of their business there. Meanwhile, immigrant STEM workers are actually creating new jobs for USA. The job market isn't a Zero-Sum Game. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). \n\nThird, each immigrant workers in STEM fields pay considerable amount of tax to the federal and the state, generally more than 30% of their salary.

The STEM Extension would be highly beneficial for students, technology companies, and US economy. \n\n1) for students, this would allow them to start a career without worrying excessively much about visa, so they choose the right career path, get experience and settle on a job that suit their skill sets and career goals before they rush into a long-term visa sponsorship commitment (it takes up to seven years to get a green card and applicants have to stay with the same company during the period).\n\n2) for tech companies, the policy would make it easier to hire more talented students from the world and keep them for longer. Currently many companies cannot afford to hire international students because it's both high cost and high risk to sponsor them a working visa, and they really don't have much time to make an informed decision before the candidates' OPT period runs out; as a result, they just don't hire international students at all. This policy would allow them to keep a new hire for at least three years before making the decision about visa sponsorship. So the cost and risk of hiring international students would be much lowered. Thus, they get a larger pool of candidates to choose from and have a higher chance of hiring the \"right\" candidates.\n\n3) for US economy, the benefit goes two ways - colleges and tech industries.\na. for colleges, this is a big incentive for talents to attend US colleges because they can get practical training after graduation.

Therefore, the extension of OPT program is more than benefit to most of the companies and industries since there would be more choice for them when hiring. \nBesides, if the extension of OPT was rejected, there will be a large amount of current international employees go back to their own countries.

Here are the reasons make me believe so.\n\nI. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. STEM degrees holders are typically foundation of a prospered economy. Almost everything we use in this modern era are benefited from those specialized people who are in STEM area. I cannot imagine what this world would be today if we don't have computers, Internet, airplanes, bridges, radio, medical appliance, electricity and many more countless products we heavily rely on in our daily life. None of those are brought to us without STEM people's constantly contribution. So STEM people are important to U.S. especially for those who qualifiedly obtained B.S. degree and even higher degrees from U.S. university and educational institutes.    \n\nII. Longer OPT term would help attracting talented students from all around the world to come to U.S. for further study. This would help U.S. universities to strengthen their ability of research and have good reputation in the world.   \n\nIII. Qualified STEM students are young, passionate and creative. They have great potentials to contribute a lot to this economy.  Qualified STEM students usually have higher incomes than overall average U.S. income. They contribute in taxes. They spend money thus to support our economy. They can create more job opportunities from outcome of their research and hard working results.    \n\nIV. If we don't pass this regulation, we are actually forcing those talented people to leave U.S. to other countries. As we all know, U.S. is a immigration country and our prosperity are brought by talented and dedicated immigrants from all over the world. If we lost those talented people, we would have definitely lost our competitivity over other countries and U.S. cannot be the greatest country in this world anymore.   \n  ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jonathan Nie", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17434", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT extension will help students as it will give them practical exposure after studying at universities, help them re-pay their student loans.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vishnu Makam", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2729", "postedDate": "2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "When will Congress start to represent US citizens instead of foreign students expensed by Taxpayers money.

However, students have to get H1b visa to continue working after the OPT expiration. And not all students who have job offer are able to get H1b as the number of h1b visa are limited. As a result, expanding the OPT would increase the chance to get H1B. Otherwise, those who have job offer have to leave the U.S. country. Second, expanding the OPT will give students more time to get experience in their related major after the graduation. Third, this regulation is also benefit for company who hire international students. When students who work in company in one or two years, they normally just get in used to what's really going on of the company.

I'm an international Master student who just graduated and started to work as a Software Developer in St. Louis with OPT. \n\nFirstly, I decided to come to U.S. for Masters because both of my family and I think U.S. is more inclusive with the 29 months' OPT period to learn and grow up. Nowadays, according to my knowledge, European countries and Canada are also changing their strategies to attract more international students to contribute their education and economies. One of my friend decided to go to EPFL because of low tuition fees; another talented friend of mine decided to go to University of Toronto because it offered him full awards. So, if U.S. can't guarantee an attractive OPT extension policy, I am afraid more students would choose other countries, which would definitely affect American economies.\n\nSecondly, I believe this OPT extension rule can benefit more for Americans. International students also need to pay taxes, apartments rent, food, and services. This would definitely stimulate American economies to grow and prosper. For example, my family has invested 100 thousands dollars for my education in U.S. And the money I paid all goes to American economies.\n\nAnd DHS offers many conditions for OPT extension: employers must be E-verified; employers must first guarantee Americans working opportunities, etc. So many rules have already made working in U.S. difficult enough, if a student can stay, we can say he must be good enough to contribute more to the country, so why not extend their stay and benefit more for both?\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply what I learned from US university to U.S. high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in U.S., I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nThe last but not the least important, I believe it would be a disaster for U.S. companies and the whole industry if this OPT extension rule is not approved at the end. Because tens of thousands of OPT workers will have to leave the U.S. immediately, and their work will be delayed immediately, so where can companies find so many talents for continuing the work, which may be supporting people's life? And also I believe many current international students would also leave when they earned their degrees, because this is no more an inclusive country.\n\nAs it would benefit both American and international students, I hope more people would support this good policy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Suichao  Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8772", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am happy that DHS made this move. \n\nFirst of all workers with STEM degrees will create a lot job opportunities.

About salary: Some people say foreign workers receive a lower wage to get employed. I earn a salary between $70,000 to $ 80,000 a year as a Business analyst. The average salary of a business analyst is around $50,000 per year. So as a new graduate, at lease in my case, i don't get employed because of lower salary.  \n\n2. About jobs: As the U.S economy is recovering and growing, there has been an increasing demand (released by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)  for skills in the STEM field for companies small and big. If the OPT extension is cancelled, then there will be shortages of people with mathematical skills, computer science and engineering backgrounds. As a result of shortage of talents, the growth of those companies will hurt domestically and lose competitiveness internationally in the long run as other countries are catching up by attracting talents and advancing their academic researches and study.\nMeanwhile, i spend most of my earning on grocery, transportation, shopping, renting, health and car insurance and of course state and federal taxes. These consumption also in turn helps create job opportunities.\n\n3.

Also, we all see that when the opt extension was published, the economy of America was increasing and for now, the rate of unemployment is at the lowest of the history.

Foreign students studying in the universities today is a great source of making contributions to US. If they can find a job and stay, that means they're capable of mastering present technology and making novel enhancement. That's good for US. For an example, information technology, mainly Silicon Valley, is a highlight point in US industry. Many foreign students work for large and competitive companies such as Google, Facebook after they graduate. Their contributions make US IT industry even more competitive. By the way, they're paying taxes and that can be used to enhance welfare. \n\n2. Competition in fact isn't bad. We need competition to increase average level of candidate pool.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nSincerely,\n\nZongkun Dou", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zongkun Dou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12127", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "More and more countries are using this policy to attract more talented students to their countries.

The new 24 months STEM extension rule proposed will help that it will not affect any US based existing employees as they are covered under the provisions of new rule protects their interests. Besides, with 24 months STEM extension rule, the employers will have chance to gain more employee with diverse background, which will help expand and build their international cooperation. \nWhen more new cooperative projects are being brought to the employer, more opening positions are available in the market, and of course will benefit local employees. Here is a real case in my company: when I was in my OPT program, I was employed since there was a cooperative project with a Chinese IC company, and my employer want someone with Chinese background and IC technology. When this cooperative project successfully launched, it brought three more new opening positions in US job market. We all know, there are a lot cooperative project and cooperative companies in US, and they all make contribute to US technology, economy and army. OPT program and its extension rule will benefit them and US citizens.\n\n2. Without OPT program and STEM extension, universities in U.S. will lose a lot of student source from global side, since a lot of them were attracted by the OPT. Without practical training the education for 3 years will not prove to be beneficial to the students (Ex: mobile- android/iOS development); and in developing countries the OPT is not available and that is why the students come to U.S. \nWhen losing international source, it will bring big economic lose: since most of international student come to U.S. for a 2-year M.S. degree by using their own money; and every student will contribute $200000.00 for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue to US (Total $80000000000.00). Now if we cancel the rule, this huge amount $80000000000.00 will go to other countries.\nFurther more, with the new 24 months STEM extension, students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years.\n\n3.Without OPT program and OPT STEM extension rule, employers in STEM will lose a lot of current employees who are in OPT extension or OPT program, especially careers in IT and IC industry like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft etc. \nWithout practical training the education for 17 months will not prove to be beneficial to the students; and students will leave US, in the middle of their practical training with half-baked experience, if the OPT stem is not for a minimum of 3 years. Since the training program is not longer enough to gaining experience. \nWe all know, to be honest, in the first year of your job, it is the year for you to learn your professional tech and the culture of the company, and also to build your network. So current OPT program without extension is just one year, and it is totally not work for people who want to practice their professional knowledge an techniques. So back to current situation, if we cancel the OPT program, current students in OPT program or STEM extension will be forced to leave their companies, this will cause terrible chaos, since their job will suddenly stopped, there will be no time to recovery their project or find a proper people to continue their work, even more some project without them will be canceled, like some international cooperative projects. That means a huge money loss. \nFurthermore, if we cancel OPT and its STEM extension, more STEM students will just leave US after graduation, this will be a huge lose for current company in STEM area. Since current in US universities, international student is the majority to dedicate in STEM area like BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology. This will be a terrible disaster to U.S. technology and economy development.\n\nDue to points in 3., I strongly suggest the new rule should be implemented by Jan 2016 (before the 12 Feb 2016) deadline by the court. This will reduce the uncertainty for the career of the student and they can focus on their work/training they are undergoing if the new rule is enacted in advance.\n\nI totally support the new STEM extension rule, but I think the new rule should not be a burden with lot of paper work and the procedure should be simplified by online submissions. The OPT Stem Extension Formal Training Program and Customized mentoring procedure and training rule should be simplified for the benefit of small employers and should reduce the unnecessary documentation work. Cap-Gap Relief should be retain, since we do not want a dent in our career and resume. Besides, there should be a new rule that all the OPT Students with stem extension should be given automatically given H1B visa after they complete the OPT extension to serve US with their talent.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xue Zhang", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11568", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposed rule for extra OPT extension so that US can attract more international students to better grow the economy and education.

Imagine if there is no STEM student work for USA at all, what will happen to the technology and science field of United States?So scared to think about.\n\nNowadays USA is the greatest country in the world, it needs people from all countries contribute their efforts to maintain the position.\n\nIn a nutshell, not only the international students need the extension in order to gain real world working experiences after their graduation, but also the companies, the market, and the U.S. need these group of people to improve the economy and help the U.S. stay in the lead in various fields. \n\nIn terms of all these factors, I truly do believe that the benefits will over-weight the harms for passing the STEM extension rule. \n\nThank you for your time and attention for reading through my comments!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuqi SI", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10878", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new STEM OPT extension rule due to reasons from the following aspects:\n1.\tExpanding STEM OPT rule will increase the competitiveness of U.S. academic sector on the international market. I'm a recent PhD graduate in atmospheric science from China and am right now a postdoc scholar in University of California. Before I came to US, I had multiple offers from US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason for me to choose US over all other countries is that US could provide me the follow-up academic training (postdoc and potentially research scientist positions) after graduation. \n2.\tExpanding STEM OPT rule will increase the productivity and advancing the development of US STEM scientific research. Most Universities (including Univ. California system) do not support H1B for postdoc scholars. In my case, when the judge on vacating OPT came out this August, my postdoc advisor regretfully expressed that if OPT cannot continue, I would have to terminate my postdoc training immediately and go back to China, because he cannot sponsor the H1B due to school regulations. Considering we currently have papers in review in 'Science' and 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences', the premature termination of OPT will impose a delay on publishing timing research and potentially have European competitors taking the lead. In my field, international postdoc scholars contribute to about half of the total postdoc community, vacating the STEM OPT would strike the competitiveness of US research community unequivocally.\n3.\t3 years of STEM OPT fits the turnover cycle of most scientific research projects. Most NSF funded project features length of 3-5 years. For example, the project I am currently working on is funded for a total of 5 years. Therefore 3 years of OPT would be an appropriate length to get high quality research done and paper published, and transition from postdoc scholar to a research scientist type of positions. Appropriate OPT length also ensures that the employers would not have to worry about handling over a bunch of half-done projects to groups of completely new postdocs which would very likely impose a serious delay in the research progress.\n4.\tSTEM OPT extension is positioned in a way to protect US workers from employer abuses of the program and thus is a win-win proposition. \na)\tThe new rule explicitly states that \"The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity\"which increases the hiring cost for a STEM OPT worker over a US worker, NOT vice versa; \nb)\t\"the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student\" - which enhances the job security of US worker over STEM OPT workers;\nc)\t\"If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers, the employer would be required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment.\" - which clearly rebuts the arguments that \"hiring STEM OPT worker is cheaper than hiring a US worker and thus granting advantages to STEM OPT worker over US worker\".\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yujie He", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12395", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "  I strongly support the proposed rules.\n  We are the promising and excellent students who want to study in America.

Honestly, I planned going back, I readlly did, when I just graduated from school, and it occurred to me that I have my family to take care, I can listen and speak language that I understand, or get to a position in a sordid way which is out of rules.

How about the contributions made by these people working under OPT? Is there enough US citizens to replace them? If so, how about the average quality?\n4. Are these companies hiring unstable OPT workers while they having better local candidates?\n5. Are these objectors really think OPT workers are taking their jobs, or they are actually worried about lacking in competence?\n6.

Think about this, Google, Apple and many other companies and research institutions, they couldn't be as powerful as they are now without STEM students.\n\nIn sum, my point is to agree with the 24-month OPT extension for F-1 STEM students.

As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.

The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\n3.\"\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright  2015 StopOverreach.com\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by RYAN  VANDER HEIDE", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8602", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's good to extend OPT for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension.

The OPT for international students would not be harmful to the America workers, instead, it would improve the native students by introducing competition in the market. Anyone with basic of economy knew that free competition would improve the market and lack of competition would only result in a market with no vitality and full of under-qualified products.\n\n2. The high tech companies are in need of large number of workers in the stem major. however, there is limited number of native america students in stem major, it is common sense that america students prefer business, medical and politics than science and technology. If this proposal is cancelled, there will be a great loss to the high tech companies, and in return, a great loss to the America economy. Because technology provides the basis for the non-stem majors workers. Imagine a world with no computer, no software, no machine, no car, no airplane, how would business, medical and politics strive in the world?\n\n3. America is well-known for free spirit, for welcoming high tech immigrants. Those famous scientist, such as Einstein, etc, flee to America for protection and in return, made a huge contribution to the country. The world war II wouldn't have come to an end, without the theory of E = mc2, which was a great contribution of foreign workers made to the United States. Certainly not everyone can be Einstein, but it would only worth it to keep the smartest mind in the states, regardless of which country he/she may come from. Canceling the proposal is another sense of discrimination, which is against the basic spirit of the states.\n\nOverall, it would only be beneficial for the country, and for the native America students/workers to adopt this proposal. And it would also be beneficial to the international students in science and technology. And I also wondered that if the policy for foreign students just keep going worse and worse, those students might get a better choice elsewhere outside the states, and America would not necessarily be the leading country in science and technology any more.

They bring benefit for the companies and at the same time it's a good thing for the American's economic progress! Students can get more industry experience and provide American companies with workload and intelligence.\n\nOn the other hand, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students also means that study in the US is more attractive. More and more students will come to the US to get there degree because they know they can get more experience after their degree. In this case, American universities will be more attractive to international students compare with European universities. And this also can bring more money expense in the US.\n\nIn conclusion, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degree is necessary for both the US and the students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shifu Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1199", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Personally I strongly SUPPORT this OPT-Extension Basing on the following reasons:\n\nFirstly, the STEM students which can be authorized STEM OPT extensions are high-qualified for the job position, this is why the company wants to hire such students as a employee. So I think it will be better to extend the time for these students working in US which can let them make more contributions on the development of economy and technology of US. The extended 16 months will let the US government receive more benefits from these students. Besides, the students in their OPT can accept lower salary than American employee, which is good for the company in US to earn more money.\n\nSecondly, getting the OPT-Extension doesn't mean letting more international students get the VISA in US. I have seen a lot of students who didn't get the VISA from the lottery after having the OPT. So these students will not occupy the job opportunity for American students because every year there are still a lot of new vacancies for the graduated students. What's more, these international students will also not have negative effect on American students when finding a job. For those who said that the international students will steal the work chance of native students, they just want to find an excuse for their not working hardly or not talent in a certain field enough. The employee needed by the company are those who are high-talented and high-qualified for the work because this can provide more benefits for the company, the process of employment thus need to consider the qualification of candidates more instead of the status of students. This is the best for the development of the companies in US. \n\nAmerican jobs for Americans first, I agree this statement, but this is only for the situation where the American students are qualified enough from the companies' aspect. I notice that those American students with STEM degrees and good skills can still get employed and they are in priority to be considered when the international student and native student are in the same level. So extension of OPT doesn't mean that the American jobs isn't for Americans first. Let's give the right of making decision whether to hire international student or native student to the companies and let them consider basing on the qualification, I think this is the right way.\n\nLast but not least, this OPT-extension can help a lot of international students after their graduation, which in turn can attract more international students to choose the US University to have their further education. This can help the development of universities in US a lot.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chen Xue", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5954", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is a good policy that international student with high tech knowledge, higher degree and various capabilities can work longer for companies in US.

Diversity is very important for the U.S.. There are quite a few remarkable people who achieved success were once international students. Also, United States is well known of its diversity and inclusion.\n\n2. Increasing number of international students who want to come to the U.S. for study indicates that U.S. is strong in education and it is willing to share its wisdom. \n\n3. Competition does exist but it is positive competition. International students gain skills from high level education and target on the opportunities needing specific requirements while U.S. citizens may not have these required skills.This positive competition can help U.S. to select better candidates and improve average competitiveness. It also can increase the global competitiveness of the U.S. with these better candidates, no matter they are citizens or aliens.\n\n4. Fairness for talents need to be enforced. As a matter of fact, the U.S. is also well known of equal opportunity which is also a main reason that more and more talents want to come and stay in the U.S.. This can be enforced by this proposal by giving fair opportunity to international students who have talents. By doing this, the U.S. shows it is indeed a strong country.\n\n5. The government should let the students who learned knowledge and improved themselves from U.S. universities stay in the country in order to make contributions to the U.S. as payback.

There are couple of suggestions regarding the application of rule for existing students on OPT Extension.\n\n1. Making it mandatory to apply before 120 days of end of 17 months extension would result in many students becoming ineligible to take advantage of the rule and thus void to great extent the original purpose of this rule. Instead I believe giving such students a chance to again apply for remaining 7 months of extension within 60 days ( Time given to them to leave US) after the 17 month extension has expired would end up giving more students if not all, a better prospect to take advantage of this rule. They still wont be able to work as work permit has expired but they can legally stay like in the case of cap-gap and wait for their renewed EAD card.\n\n2. For certain students in CAP-GAP (With EAD expiring before 1st April) work authorization should be provided as they have a employer filling their H1B but they have to wait till Oct 1st (If there H1 is apporved) to start working or resume working. This makes cap-gap not that effective. If a student is considered a highly skilled labor then making that labor sit idle for 6 or more months is not fruitful to any involved parties. I believe if the employer of such students (who have their EAD expiring no earlier then 60 days (time for them to leave US ) before 1st April (Date of H1B filing)) is providing consent to file H1 for that student then such students should be provided with a extended work authorization till Oct 1st (H1B status start date provided they were approved).\n\nOnce again I would like to thank DHS and all the employees of USCIS that work so hard to provide many students like me all the help and support to overcome this tedious task of maintaining legal status in this land of free.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mohit Pillay", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1486", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule!\n\nI am a U.S citizen, own a house which nearby RIT and University of Rochester, in recently years, most of my tenants are international students.

My major is nutrition and the projects of our field almost always need more than one-year to complete, like most other biological sciences.  There are unexpected experiment failures and we need replications of results, not to mention the time to do literature review, study design and manuscript writing.  We may need three months simply to raise the rats for the experiments. Biological science is full of variability and it is common to spend more than 1 year to discover something. 24-months OPT extension could greatly help us gain a full experience of a project from beginning to the end. \n\nRich work/research experience could help us find better jobs in our home country. As for myself, all my families are in my home country and I am definitely coming back after I get some experience in the U.S. I could really do something in three years, using what I learned from the U.S. to make it a better place, and make myself more competitive in the job market back home. One year of experience will not be valued that much in my home country and as I mentioned above, the project could be just started and I have to leave. If I only could have one year of work experience after I finish my degree, I am not sure I would come to the U.S. in the first place. Education in the U.S. is surely in a leading position in the world and I could get great in-class knowledge. But without the practical experience, we may not even be as competitive as our peers in our home country since it is much easier for them to go for interviews and make more local connections in our home country.\n\n24 months OPT extension rule is not only good for us, as international students, but it is also upgrade the attraction for the U.S. 24 months OPT extension rule will attract more young talents around the world to the U.S. When the U.S. education helps nurturing them, they could also work with the American students making each other stronger, more competitive and understanding each other better.  When we get back to our home country, after several years, we will be the leaders in our field in our country. At that time, the leaders in the U.S. might already know us from the time we are both in the same school and it is easier for us to communicate and collaborate in many ways.

The displacement of American workers by OPT / extended OPT workers.\n2. The non-reporting of work / residence status by the OPT worker.\n3. The extension being applicable for students working in fields not related to their program of education, thus invalidating the purpose of the program and adding unneeded competition to the U.S. citizen workforce.\n\nThese concerns are infact adequately addressed by the OPT/  proposed OPT extension programs available for comment at the federal register (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/19/2015-26395/improving-and-expanding-training-opportunities-for-f-1-nonimmigrant-students-with-stem-degrees-and). The basic post completion OPT program, which is of a 12-month period, is meant to be a way for students, as part of their education in the U.S., to obtain relevant industrial experience which they can then use in their home countries. This proposed rule still retains this flavor. The proposed rule clearly states that the duties, hours and compensation of a STEM OPT student should be similar to that of similar U.S. workers. Also, the students have been required to report their residence and employment status to the DSO on a regular basis and there have been several instances of the OPT being denied to students on the basis of violation of this requirement. There is also a requirement that the student must pursue an OPT in a field directly related to their education. It is reasonable that as long as the student utilizes the skills acquired by his/her education in the U.S. in his/her work as an OPT worker, he/she should be able to pursue the OPT. Moreover, the rule requires the institution educating the OPT worker to be accredited, thus ensuring that the quality of the students in OPT is similar to that of the American worker. \n\nWithout the OPT program, the student would find it difficult to pursue a job in his/her home country after graduation which is counterproductive to the purpose of the education. A certain amount of industrial experience (12 months) is quite reasonable to this end. The extension is required in some cases of more complicated fields such as STEM, where it takes longer to gain the required amount of experience  in order for the student to be competitive in the job market of that field. This also facilitates international talent to the workforce and the industry and economy benefit by the varied perspectives brought by the international worker, which is part of the intent of this program. All this also provides a greater incentive to attract international talent, thus providing a win-win for both the international student and the U.S. economy. \n\nThus the OPT program should be recognized as a benefit and should be retained.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Krishnan Raghavan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10472", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree with the proposed rule that would allow international students with a STEM degree to stay in the U.S for an additional 7months.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Aundia Vafadari", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1992", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\nThe 24-month extension will significantly aid me to update myself well in the desired field of contribution and bring in the deliverable as planned from a practitioners stand point.It is more to do with transitioning from research to change implementation while continuing to learn and standardize efforts.\n\nThank you for the consideration.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rajalakshmi Kamalakannan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8020", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We need to give our students these high paying and skilled jobs.

The effect of this rule will be to create incentives for employers to hire foreign students at reduced wages and reduce opportunities for American citizens. Moreover, as many of these jobs are in the technology field, the job opportunities lost by Americans will be in formerly high paying jobs. This will allow technology companies to profit at the expense of American citizens.\n\nWe have an immigration system that Obama repeatedly says is 'broken', so increasing the number and/or length of visas is simply increasing the burden on this 'broken' system. Visa overstays are one of the biggest problems with our current system, so it will increase the cost to American taxpayers to identify and enforce existing immigration laws as it relates to these foreign workers as many will undoubtedly simply ignore the expiration of their visas. And the Obama administration ICE won't enforce the existing laws in any case.\n\nAs many of these jobs will be located in California, has anyone conducted an environmental impact study on the effect of adding additional population to California's already strained environment will cause? Does it make sense to bring more people into California when there isn't enough water for the current population? Additionally, what impact will bringing in foreign workers have upon native born Americans in areas such as San Francisco where it will only increase the cost of real estate and depress the wages of those whom can't afford rent, particularly after they lose their high tech job?\n\nFinally, we know ICE does a terrible job of actually vetting immigrants for possible terrorist ties. What steps are being taken to investigate students from terrorist supporting countries such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen? What strain will these people be upon local taxpayer resources when English is not their first language? What impact will bringing people in from countries that don't support American values have upon the local communities?\n\nThis is a blatant end run around Congress and a violation of the separation of powers.

If these people are seeking opportunities in the US, we certainly should let them be here.\n\nSecond, without competitive environment domestically, our workers will only charge for more and be less motivated to bring innovation or to refine their technologies in order to be able to beat their competitors. Yes, in a globalized world, competitions are already prevalent, but without the competition from finding jobs on, many Americans would simply not realize how reality works. American labor force has much lower efficiency compared to their German or Japanese counterparts. If we want them to be strong again, we should give equal opportunities to international job candidates.\n\nThird, it is nearly down right myopia for people living in the world's most powerful country to say that international people are stealing their welfare. America is a mature capitalistic market. We encourage the proposition that competition brings upward thrusts to drive the country forward. We also know that the scarcity of labor force is and will be the status quo throughout the entire human history, which means that those claims of aliens' threats are mostly false and are mainly used to serve for propaganda carried out by certain interest groups.

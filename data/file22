As we know, the high tech companies desperately need those students with great capability of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. However, those companies could hardly hire enough qualified employees if they only pick the employees from the resident pool. If the proposed rule is denied by the government, those students will go back to China or India and contribute to their motherland. They may create another Huawei, Alibaba or JD in the next few years, which will create ten thousands of job positions. At that time, the high tech industry in the United States will suffer from more severe competitions in a global view, which will be greatly harmful to the economics of the United States. \nSecond, it benefits the higher education system in the United States. In the past 7 or 8 years, several millions of international students came to America and pursue their bachelor or graduate degrees here. It brings a really huge amount of money to the universities in the United States. If the rule is denied somehow, the students and their parents will be hesitate when they decide to study abroad, because they have to pay fifty thousands dollars per year! Everyone can see it is not a good investment if they can only get the degrees and go back home. At that time, the higher education system in America may suffer from  more seriously financial problems, and then it would have to raise the tuition fees. Those residents' families would pay much more than before if they want to send their children to college!\nFinally, it benefits the whole country. America is a great country that consists of various of immigrants. The reason why the United States becomes No.1 in the world is that it absorbs all the intelligent people from all over the world. Those people make the United States more thrive and prosper. To against the rule is to against the basics of America spirit, the foundation of the United States and also the America dream. If the rule is denied, people from other country may think that America is no longer a great country because it closes the door to those people who can make it more prosperity. People will turn back to other developed country, and America will lose its global competitiveness.\nTo summary, it is definitely a \"win-win\" thing to approve this proposed rule. It will bring vitality to the high tech industry and the higher education system in the United States. It will attract more international students to study in America and boost local economy. And it will make the United States to be more thrive and prosper than ever.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yifan Wei", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13349", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose expanding the Optional Practical Training rule proposal by the Dept of Homeland Security.

It is helpful for America to attract talents all over the world and their contribution after graduation in OPT or OPT extension program is a huge help for America's competitiveness in globalization market. \n\nBut this time I want to response against those opponents to this proposal who think STEM students don't need training after graduation and can go to full-time position directly. I find it a very ridiculous comment. My personal academical and professional experience told me practical training after graduation is very necessary as a transition to formal career. I got my bachelor in mechanical engineering. During my undergraduate program I did a lot of projects and several internship programs. My training ranged from most basic manufacturing techniques to advanced automated processing and robotics techniques. My internship field included electricity power plant, automobile industry and air conditioner industry. I think I had enough training and studied very hard. But when i graduated, when i was thrown to real working field, I still need a mentor to guild me not just in practical operation of the machines but also teach me domain knowledge of the whole business on the upper level from a more economical and practical perspective instead of just from academical and theoretical perspectives. \n\nIt is not just the case in mechanical engineering, it is true for other STEM majors too. For me personally, I changed my major to industrial engineering focusing on operation research and data analytical fields. During my master program at Purdue University, I gained abundant analytical experience in different fields like marketing, finance, healthcare and production. But it was still very different from real analytical and consulting cases. For example, the data set i worked with during my master program has been simplified and the business scenario has also been tailored by professors for education purpose. Therefore after graduation training is very necessary. \n\nAlso I notice that most the opponents thinking training is not necessary are graduates in 1950 or 1960s. They haven't noticed how different it is today and how rapidly technology develops. For example, I used \"IBM many eyes\" for my data visualization projects, which i thought was very cool and planned to bring to my career. But in this June, IBM stopped serving this products, which means what I learned at school suddenly became useless and outdated. But because of the OPT program, I can still have training after graduation to keep myself at the edge of technology. \n\nFinally some people also say \"sending those F1 students back to their home country for training\". I think it is very impetuous, arrogant and lack of concern. First of all, those F1 students won't come to America at all for study if there is no attractive OPT and OPT extension program after their graduation. America is not the only choice. There are Canada, Austria, England, Taiwan, Singapore and China, who are planning to establish new rules to attract talents all over the world. For those STEM students who chose to come to America for higher education before original OPT extension rule change, a promise by American government that there would be 12 months OPT plus 17 months extension was one of the biggest reasons they came to United States. \n\nTherefore, retaining OPT program and extending its extension period from 17 months to 24 months can only attract more talents all over the world for study which is a big stimulant for American economy and retaining American's global competitiveness.

The international student is a big part and significantly contribute to the technology and economic development for U.S. The international student, especially in graduate program, consists a big portion. For example, in petroleum engineering, most graduate students are international. At MPGE, University of Oklahoma, 83% graduate students are international in 2015 (http://issuu.com/mpge/docs/2015_status_report). Similar situation is happening in other petroleum programs, such as UT Austin, Texas A&M and others. The graduate students know the latest technology and knowledge in petroleum industry and they are innovative. This is their advantage over the undergraduates. They are the reason that US has been the world leader in oil&gas for years. If they don't have the OPT extension, they won't be able to work in US and will go back home country eventually. Then, an issue will raise up for the government: Who will keep the development in petroleum engineering? Who will propose new ideas to extract more oil and gas from subsurface? Therefore, in order to maintain such development, it is essential to pass the OPT extension, giving international students the opportunity to work in US.\n\n2. Giving an opportunity for international student to work in US will also increase the competitiveness. If there is no OPT extension, residents will have a job no matter what they are capable of. Perhaps they can be a senior engineer without knowing the basic concepts. I heard this story from my friend: one colleague, who has 2-year experience, asked my friend if high permeability is good or bad? The impact of permeability to oil & gas production is lesson 101 for a petroleum engineer. But, sadly, this colleague don't have a clear clue to such basic thing and she still has a position in a big oil operation company. Can you imagine what would happen if she further promote to be a reservoir manager? Without competition, people will be lazy and don't improve themselves. And eventually, the petroleum industry will fall back rather than move forward. This is also true for other industry.\n\nOverall, OPT extension should be approved. The international students will be able to work in US and keep the growth of technology and economy in a big picture. This policy will stimulate good things to happen.

US has the world top STEM universities and therefore attract the world's top brains to study and, with the help of OPT, work here. They constantly bring new ideas from academia to industries through the OPT program after the graduation. A longer OPT period, which means the extension here, would make sure these top minds would stay in the industries longer and therefore create more synergies between technology and business, which is exactly what US needs to create more jobs and opportunities. \n\nMore than the mind-power, international students help the US firms to expand internationally. These guys come to study in US are often smart and well-connected locally. By start working in US for US companies, they are able and often glad to bring US business back to their motherlands. These kind of local expertise is exactly what US business needs to compete in such a flat world. And a longer OPT period would make US business even more competitive.\n\nSo please approve the extension, we need the international STEM students and we need them to work here longer.

Many international students are masters or PhDs with advanced expertise, instead of the \"unlawful low-levellers\". The proposed policy influences the job market for the STEM graduates with decent degrees deferred within U.S. If one happens to stay out of a job, and happens to be an American, - before making judgment - it might be more objective for one to consider the competency between him/herself and the counterparts with more cultivated education background that the American institution has nurtured. \nSecondly, the historical low unemployment requires to digest work forces to boost the economy. We don't need to bypass the fact that the U.S. might be at a great era ever since 2008, perhaps an unprecedented one in the course of reaching a peaked economy. Turning down and expelling work force with cutting edge expertise would be exceedingly disruptive both imminently and in the long run. And also where are the diversity and equality which this country values as declared by its founders?\nLast but not least, unlike H1B workers, the STEM OPT based graduate employees pay the taxes just the same as the citizens, hypothetically they ARE willing to stay and contribute in longer term, they have already gone through the incredibly harsh lottery , and yet this is in disregard to fact that these graduates will find perfect niche any way elsewhere rendering tremendous loss of talents, considering the competitiveness sharpened from the colleges and universities in this country. \nIn conclusion.

I believe that this increased duration of practical training will be greatly beneficial for science & technology development and economic growth in the U.S. STEM graduate students receive valuable education here at U.S., mostly supported by government or private foundation funding, and it makes completely no sense to a society to create obstacles on purpose to prevent these highly educated STEM immigrants from giving back to the society. In such a competitive global environment, high-skilled personnel in STEM is the key to economic growth. This of and in itself speaks for the importance of the proposed change on OPT, which will help to keep these valuable workforces. \n\nMost people oppose this proposal argue that STEM immigrants are substitute for native workers, as they are willing to be paid less than native workers. This is wrong for several reasons.\n(1)\tUnemployment in STEM fields is much lower than the national average of 6.2% in 2014. For example, there are currently five job openings for every one unemployed computer worker, and surveys on employer actually show that some companies suffer from high cost and losses due to hiring difficulties. \n(2)\tThe augment is heavily based on the assumption a limited number of jobs are available that if a spot taken by an immigrant will take away that of a native worker. This logic ignores the dynamic effects, e.g. the job taken by a high-skilled immigrant will generate service jobs and drive increases in wages for local workers. In addition, as mentioned, STEM immigrants are high skilled workers and often the best in their own countries; they can create jobs through creativity and innovation. Countless examples can be found among the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.\n(3)\tLastly, there is NO convincing data to show that STEM immigrants are paid less than native workers. Indeed, by examining H-1B wage data in various IT and engineering occupations, one could find that H1B vs. prevailing wages are very comparable. For cases that some companies abuse STEM immigrants by paying them less, I find it is the U.S. Department of Labor who should enforce the existing rules to against this unlawful practice and ensure the fair competition in the job market. \n\nImmigration has been a constant and valuable source of economic vitality and demographic dynamism throughout this nation's history. It is not an exaggeration at all to say that America achieves what it has today by welcoming and valuing immigrants. It is irreversible and wrong to shut the door for high skilled STEM students and prevent them from continuing contributing to the much needed labor force in the innovation-based and high-value sectors. \n\nIn sum, I fully support the proposal and believe the change is an important part of the solutions to keep U.S. to compete on a global scale. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Liling  Wan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15346", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal.\nSince international students have learned knowledge from US university for more than one year, they should have an opportunity to practice what they got in the real world", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jiaxin Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11070", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think we should treat foreign students as if they are one of our own.

Almost 90% of full time subsea engineering students are international students and 80% of them can get A in subsea engineering courses. These talent people may be important to U.S. Because most employers would like to hire talent people and these people could do a better job to improve the competitiveness. Thus,improving and expanding OPT would be a good news for employers. Also, if every company can hire the talent employee, they can contribute more to the economy of U.S. \n\nImproving and expanding OPT is very important for F1 students. Also it is very beneficial to U.S. Please give more opportunities for all F1 student to contribute more. \n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ivan Cui", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16487", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I have to say our stem students have done lots of work for U.S Eco.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department says \"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\nRon Hira of Howard University: \n\n\"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.\"\n\"It's an over-reach to claim that someone who completes a master's degree in as little as 12 months needs three years interning -- at low or no pay in many cases -- to get further training.\"\n\n   This certainly causes one to only imagine the real reasons why the Obama Administration wants this completely absurd program to be implemented!  He is definitely attempting to turn our country over to illegals and foreigners! \n\n\n     But DHS' proposed rule \"is pushing the ones raised and trained at home out of the job market that we created these education initiatives for and handing those jobs to students who have no ties to the U.S. other than their education.\" (Joe Cunningham of Red State).\n\n     I very much agree with Sam Rolley of Personal Liberty who states:\n\"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.\"\n\n\n     The bottom line is our country needs to support OUR citizens & their children with these jobs and programs - not foreigners and especially not ILLEGALS!\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Patricia Davidson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3363", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a student and I am also an electrical engineer.

I'm an international computer science master student from China and was a software engineer intern. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nCountries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. \n\nFor example, Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. [35] In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. [36] This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. [37] By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. [38] In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022.\n\ninternational students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the extension for OPT will benefit United States' economy and academic, I hope more people can support that.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wan Yang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19935", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Why doesnt the government work as hard for American workers than foreign workers.Stop voting for these immigrant\nloving politicians, take care of America first.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Terry Pingel", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6767", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM fields are what the government needs to pushing the nation forward.

International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014. For every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. (leaps and bounds ahead of the 430,000 jobs over the span of 4 years 2009-2013, that you are mentioning time and again). \n\nAlso consider those millions jobs which they will generate when they start their own enterprises with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world.

I work for a public company in the United States. The original Stem Extension rule being voided has recently put my ability to continue employment in danger, which would take away the job I worked years studying for, not to mention make the company face an unexpected vacancy and go through months hiring and training new employees and hurting their productivity.\nThis rule not only benefits hardworking, legal workers and also benefit US companies and their productivity. Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nLingyi", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lingyi Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22534", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is the most moronic thing I've heard of .

We are providing the best higher education to the best of the best students all over the world. It does not make any sense if we just let them leave the US, return to their original country, and contribute with all they've learned in the US. Why the US is the strongest country in the world? Because we have the best people - the best scientists, the best engineers, and the best scholars. A large part of the most successful figures in science and industry in the US are originally international students. They received the best education, and then start to contribute to this country, using the OPT and OPT STEM extension opportunities. Without these wonderful opportunities, they would have returned to their own country, start their business, lead their research, serve for their military forces, and help their own country to surpass the US.\n\nSome people hold the narrow and one-sided opinion that international students are seizing the job opportunities of US native workers. This is very short-sighted, and just, rediculous and selfish. Most of the international students who need OPT STEM extension receive the highest education in the US, and they are seeking opportunities like engineers and scientists. Are we having too many engineers and scientists in the US? No!!! We have too few of them. China, India, Russia and Brazil are spending a huge amount of money to attrack the best scientists and engineers to go to their countries; and we, the US, are thinking of expelling them because they are seizing job opportunities of local workers? How many of our local workers are qualified for the top-level scientists and engineers positions that require years of master or even doctoral level training? I don't know the exact number, but I believe 0.01% might be an over-estimate.\n\nBesides, we strongly believe that the OPT STEM extension opportunity will create more job opportunities for our local people. Many of the international students are seeking for scientists and engineering positions, and they need the opportunity to gain working experience in the US. But mostly they are not going to always stay in these companies. They want to start their own business in the US, and hire local people. No one doubts that the United States is the best place to start your business, and now is the best time, than ever. Many of our most impactful and successful companies are originally start-up companies, and many of them are started by international students. Do you know Nvidia, the largest manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the world? It is founded by a Taiwanese, named Jen-Hsun Huang. If he did not have the opportunity to work in the US, there would be no Nvidia, thus no general purpose GPU, no advancement in deep learning - a revolutionary achievement in artificial intelligence, no modern video games with lavish visual effects but still running smoothly on your laptop, and our supercomputers would be hundreds of thousand times slower than what we actually have now. And, this is just on single instance, from the tens of thousands (even more) similar cases.\n\nIn summmary, we should definitely support the improving and expanding of the training opportunities of international students. It is about the destiny of the country that we all love - the United States. Let's do not be short-sighted and allured by some dangerous immediate \"benefit\".

Only losers are afraid of forward momentum and positive changes. Seriously, how insecure do you have to be, as a US citizen, about yourself, your worth, and your capabilities, that you decided to cut the incoming talent steams, just so you may keep your job for a few more years? Do you really think, to weaken your country intellectually, financially, and culturally, is the best practice for building a sustainable motherland for the future generations? America rose up because she welcomed the foreign talents. Guess what would happen when you turn them away? You will literally be making your enemies stronger.\n\n2. Who are the F-1 students anyways? They are usually the TOP tier of their society! They are either smart, or rich, or both! And they work their ass off building YOUR country. They are not criminals. They are not illegal. Get your facts straight first before you let your fear run your life. And if you are really that concerned and scared, then find a better way to MANAGE and filter the incoming students instead of choosing to close the door and live in so-called security. I won't disclose my nationality but I will tell you this - if my country did not close her door about 100 years ago, we would not have fallen so far behind and suffered so much warfare and humiliation - and students like me would probably not come to US today because, you know, our homeland would be be a much better choice compared to the bias and stereotypes and prejudice and discrimination we had to deal with here in US. So at least, learn from our mistakes in the last century, so that 100 years from now, your children can still be proud of US. \n\n3. Just a question: if you are afraid the immigrants will take away your job, what's more effective to not let that happen? Is it to invest your time and money in bettering yourself, taking advantage of the TREMENDOUS privileges you enjoy that they can't even dream of touching, and making yourself a much more marketable and desirable employee, or to sit there and whine and complain about how much stronger/better everyone else is? If you think your neighbor's kid is more talented than yours, would you help your kid get a better education, or would you go to your neighbor's house, slap their kid, and tell them to never come over and visit again?

The current OPT program provides young foreign talents that the U.S. employers need. \n(2) In many cases, STEM projects usually take a relatively long time to finish, thus an OPT Extension is essential. \n(3) Moreover, OPT Extension workers account for less than 1% of U.S. STEM workers, therefore it is unreasonable to assume that they are competing with US workers and pushing down the wages.   \n\nPoint 1: \nAmerican young people don't want to enter the job market, especially into the STEM fields, even without the whole OPT program. Actually, young foreign workers benefit employers who need passion, intelligence and out-of-box thinking, especially in nowadays global environment.\n\nSupporting evidence:\nA. Nearly 40% of people in the US ages 16 to 24 say that they don't want a job, accounting for a sizable portion of the 92 million Americans who are currently outside the labor force, according to a 2014 analysis of labor statistics. Similarly, the Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that 39.4% of men and women aged 16 to 24 are outside the labor force over the first 10 months of 2014.\n\nB. 60% of respondents ages 16 to 25 to the Lemelson-MIT Invention Index, which seeks to gauge innovation aptitude among young adults, named at least one factor that prevented them from pursuing further education or working in STEM field. 34% said they \"don't know much about these fields\" 30% said these fields are too challenging. 28% said they weren't well-prepared in school to seek out a career or further their education in these field.\n\nC. I work in the chemical industry producing chemical specialties that benefit the society. All of the young employees in my company comes from foreign countries, e.g.China, India, Poland, Morocco. Many young Americans are shunning STEM fields for more lucrative careers or less challenging jobs. And even among those who have obtained STEM degrees, large numbers are choosing to work in jobs that don't even require science or engineering degrees.\n\nPoint 2: \nAnother reason that the OPT program need to be longer than 1 year is that most STEM projects need relatively long period to complete. For example, I joined my current company and participated in a research project since the beginning of 2015. If I were forced to leave now, the project will be ceased and it will take the company several months to find another qualified worker to replace me, resulting in a lose-lose condition. \n\nPoint 3: \nOne opinion some people hold is that the shortage of STEM students is an illusion, which help to push down the wages and salaries for STEM workers. My first argument is that the rule of OPT Extension itself is not wrong, and DHS has recognized the concerns above and proposed methods to regulate the employers, such as the requirement of a prevailing salary and benefit. \nSecond, in 2013, there were 5.7 million total postings in STEM fields, in which 2.3 million (41%) are entry-level jobs requiring less than 2 years of experience. In comparison, OPT-extension workers are merely 34,000 people.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n \nDear Chief Westerlund:\n \nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2014 with a PhD degree in the field of Chemistry. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes on 1/2/2016.\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy. \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

Diversity is one of the important support for U.S, varying from Economics to Technologies,  International students are actually playing very significant roles in pushing the developments in United States.  Job candidates should be chosen from their talent, knowledge and personalities, it should be nothing related to nationalities.\n\nI saw some negative comments like international students who occupying the positions in companies will make it harder for local people to find a job. It is not true. Job hunting is a fair competition, and in fact, local people already have a way more advantages than international students, but the reason they won't got hired is not because of lack of positions, but usually lack of knowledge and the sense of working harder. Companies would rather choose employees who can make more contributions, even though they have to hire lawyers for H1B visa.  \n\nSome other Cons like the extension would lead to the depress of wages. This is incredibly illogical. wages DO NOT depend on the number of workers, they depend on how much work you can do and you have done in your company. In fact, if the company hires an talent international student, he makes a huge contributions to increase the profit of the company, this international student can also bring more benefit to other coworkers. \n\nAs for the reason of the extension, why do STEM students need more time? I think it's because they are majoring in technical field, which need more time to get trained and take a little bit longer to see the results and effect. They spent decades for studying, most of them have achieved the highest degree of their study, got certificated by both universities and industry, all they need is working without concerns. Extensions can certainly reduce their worries, making international students work harder and better in their positions. \n\nAbove are my opinions, fair judgement should be considered before making the final decisions, and the proposal for extending F-1 nonimmigrant students is surely reasonable and should be supported. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zoey Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17570", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "What is the matter with American workers?

US regulations are a matter for US citizens to decide, and not foreign nationals.  The US government should work on behalf of and for the benefit of US citizens first and foremost.  It goes without saying that foreign nationals would want permission to stay here.  \n\nThe F student visas are granted to foreign students who persuade the US government that they do not have any intention to stay in the US after completing their studies.  Therefore the F-1 student visa is definitely not supposed to be used as a means to immigrate to the US.  Similarly, the granting of an optional training period should never be considered a means to immigrate to the US by the US government.  It was designed to let the student practice their craft for a short time prior to returning to their home country as they persuaded us they would.  To extend what is a nominal 12-month period to a couple of years is to change the nature of this temporary work permit.  It should never be intended as a bridge for intending immigrants.  For STEM students, there is no dire shortage of STEM graduates.  The US Census bureau agreed with others in 2014 that there are many more STEM graduates each year than there are STEM job openings.  Our government including the Department of Homeland Security and the immigration services should not be utilizing this training visa to assist businesses in overlooking qualified trained US citizen STEM graduates when there is clearly not a shortage.  Again,  the best interests of US Citizens need to be put before those of businesses or of foreign nationals.  \n\nFor the foregoing reasons the OPT training period should remain firm at 12 months for any foreign student.  The OPT training period should not be utilized as a bridge to H1-B visas, also a non-immigrant visa.  The oversubscription of the H1-B visa program should not be a consideration in the decision about OPT training visas.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Meredith Johnson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5313", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I must say that this OPT stem extension rule , with improved rules n regulations, is a boon to the countries economy and undoubtedly very helpful to repay the heavy education loan that foreign students took to meet the living expenses and two times the university fees ( as compared to in state students).\n\nThanks dhs....:)", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Heetendra Gupta", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18340", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Strongly support for STEM OPT extension for international students.

I believe the proposed extension would benefit the high technology industries, reinforce the USA's technological superiority in the world, and indirectly create more opportunities for the Americans.  It is unlikely that any American who works hard and is willing to improve himself/herself will be impacted negatively by the proposed extension.\n\nMany of the comments being posted here stress that jobs are being taken by foreign students, and therefore, limiting, or even completely eliminating the international students' job opportunity would bring the jobs back to Americans.  This, according to my own observation, is not true.  On the contrary, it appears to me that the America's job market for the college graduates with STEM degrees is well protected for the American's benefits, and will not be harmed by extending the OPT period.\n\nNote that the proposed extension ONLY applies to foreign students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) majors, with at least a Bachelor's degree.  Students in Arts and Business majors are not eligible for this extension.  One observation I have made was that the job market for the students with STEM degrees is fairly good now in general, and is particularly so in the computer/network industry.  At the undergraduate level, the employers are much more likely to recruit domestic students.  The reason is that, positions requiring only Bachelor's degree do not usually require highly specialized skills, and the American students are sufficiently capable for such positions.  International student usually cannot compete with the American students as far as language proficiency goes, and the employer would have to make extra expenditure on sponsoring the foreign employee's work visa (H1B), which is expensive.  Even if the employers are willing to sponsor the foreign employees' work visa, the employers face the risk that the foreign employees may not be able to acquire a work visa simply because the number of H1B applicants outnumbered the quota.  If this happens, the employee would have no choice but leave the country.  In addition, many American companies who employ STEM degree holders work with the government and military (such as Boeing).  As a government requirement, these companies' employees must hold security clearances to access the classified information, which, firmly excludes the foreigners.  Anyone going to an engineering career fair for college graduates will find that almost all the employers are unwilling to sponsor H1B visa for foreign undergraduate level job seekers.\n\nAnother citizen claimed in his/her comments that the foreign students have an inproportionally high presence in the graduate schools, based on his/her not very successful graduate school application history.  This is, again, not true.  First of all, graduate school is not for everyone.  Graduate level education is supposed to be an elite education only for those who show extraordinary academic achievements, high potential in career success, and unshakable determination in solving the most difficult problems in the world.  Without disclosing his/her own background, it is not possible to tell if '2 acceptance out of 8 applications for graduate school' is a bad result for him/her.  I have studied in a few institutions in the US for several years.  According to my observation, the graduate schools are well protected for American citizen's benefit.  On one hand, it is a common practice for the public graduate schools to set a quota to limit the number of international students they accept.  This ensures that the opportunities for the domestic students are not taken away by the increase of international applicants.  In addition, many of the research projects awarded to the universities by government agencies such as the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense are strictly prohibited from being handled by foreign students.  On the other hand, there has been a trend in recent years that the number of students from emerging economics coming to the US for Master's degrees has increased dramatically.  These students, or their parents, pay very high out-of-state tuition, and have made considerable contributions to the institution's financial situations.  These additional funds available to the universities can actually be used for recruiting more faculty members and improving their infrastructure, which, would in turn allow the university to accept more American students, especially those in-state students who pay very low tuition.\n\nIn addition to the 'prevailing wage' requirement for the H1B applicants, I think it is fair to say that these STEM students are not here to fight for the $7.5/hr jobs.  They are here to fill the positions which can hardly be filled by Americans, and they are here to work hard so that America can be a great country again.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by G.

STEM OPT extension is an excellent strategy to attract more international students to American academic sectors.

These policies were originally intended to attract the \"best and the brightest\" workers to the U.S. and augment our native workforce. Instead, they are being legally abused to import vast quantities of average workers who become de-facto indentured servants while they await green card approval.\n\nWhile the industry often claims that there is a shortage of STEM workers, it has been repeatedly documented that they are in fact looking for cheap workers* and intentionally avoid hiring qualified Americans. This cost savings is achieved by legally underpaying them and by hiring young, inexperienced people who displace older, more experienced workers. \n\nOur American STEM policy is deeply flawed as it encourages legal discrimination against American workers either through direct replacement or by hiring foreigners instead of Americans. Two companies involved in high profile tech worker replacement incidents in 2015 include Southern California Edison** and Disney***.\n\nThis policy will further erode the native American STEM workforce.

There is no reason to deprive this opportunity, but only to strengthen(/extend) it. \n\nA healthy U.S. economy relies on immigration of skilled labor, which plays an important role in maintaining the supply of labor in the market. In particular for industries deeply associated with STEM disciplines, there is a significant shortage of well-educated and highly-skilled labor. It is paramount that F-1 STEM students are provided with ample chance to stay in the U.S.\n\nTo keep STEM students staying in the U.S. and contribute their skills, we need to provide a career platform that allows them to make the smooth transition from school to industry, and STEM extension for F-1 students is exactly such platform. F-1 students can use this period of time to start working in the industry and wait until being granted the proper work visa (usually H1). Since H1 lottery rejects many applicants (especially in recent years), an extended training period for STEM F-1 students allows them to apply again and hence leads to better chance to stay in the U.S. Hence extended OPT for STEM degrees is an effective means to achieve U.S. immigration policy. \n\nIt is misleading to argue that the extension would harm U.S. interests in any way.

With this policy, people like this are eager to make contribution in the related industry in us which kind of help US to keep lead in all these domains. These domains need the collaboration and we should never keep these people outside the us and we should give them an opportunity to work in the us and to contribute to our industry.\n\nSecond, I think not all the STEM students are keen on immigration or becoming an US citizen. The things they really care about is to learn the most high trend technologies and to keep our human being moving step forward. We should never doing things which stop them or keeping them away from with the not open-minded policy.\n\nThird, someone mentioned some work force company take use of this policy to make some effort and try to change something. However, from my own experience, I have never seen an example like this, and also this should not be an excuse to ban this policy because we could do more efforts on inspecting the company like this and stop them from doing this rather than totally give up this policy.

I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest.

On the one hand, more and more international students come to America for further education. While getting a relatively higher education from the US universities, they will make big contributions with solid academic background and professional practice. The US government and companies can select the more talented and diligence employees, which will make the whole society more efficient. On the other hand, international students' tuition and consuming activities will accelerate the increase of the US economy. Their tuitions are much higher than local students, which better supports the academic research economically. The food industry, retail stores, real estate industry get benefits as well. This encourage the local employment in turn. Once the new stem opt rule applies, the US will attract a huge number of international students who want to learn more US culture, which definitely will improve the economy.\n\nSecondly, this rule won't hurt local employment. As we all know, most US companies don't sponsor H1B and even don't hire a noncitizen. For this reason, most international students with a stem opt don't and can't compete for a permanent position. What they want is to get an internship to help with their future career. Do you believe internship will make harm to local employment? I don't believe so. On the contrary, interns will reduce local employees' working stress once they gain adequate professional training.\n\nThirdly, competition does exist but is not a bad thing. Many international students would like to come back their home country because of their families and career plans. Others may want to stay in America but it's really hard for them. They need to find a employer who will sponsor their H1B Visa and apply and then they only have 50% probability to succeed. It's also not a simple thing for employer to do so. An international student who can get H1B visa does have the ability to legally obtain a permanent position. But that position is not compensated by cheaper salary. The only reason will be the person is a better fit or there is no local employees available.

Think about the international students US is going to lose and the impact on economy. \n\nAs for those who oppose to the rule,first, international STEM students and their American peers are competing job opportunities fairly. The fact is there aren't as many American STEM students as international STEM students so that merely American students cannot fill the gap of the job positions. International STEM students solves the scarce STEM assets issue in the US. If anything unfair about this competition, international students actually have more limitation than the US citizens because they are not considered in government or federal related fields. Second, US workers and international STEM students do not compete against each other because of field of the job they are seeking, their skillset and their capabilities are different. International STEM students at least need to earn an accredited degree in their related field.

In fact, this proposal will create more valuable jobs in the US thus positively contributing to the US economy. After carefully reading the proposal and giving it lots of thoughts, here's why I believe this proposal is a better protection of the right to work for the US workers.\n\n1. Companies who hire F1 students DO NOT pay them less. The proposed rule clearly states that the companies have to not only give equal pay to the international STEM workers and similarly-situated native workers, but also provide a complete training and performance evaluation program to the student using their OPT. For example, if there were 2 qualified candidates and one if an F1 student while the other is an US citizen, the company would still hire the US citizen because it'd pay the same but requires less paperwork, effort & time. Therefore, the US citizen's right to work would still be protected by this proposal.\nCompanies could save a lot of time and money by hiring native workers, but they have never stopped hiring more international students because not enough US workers have the required STEM skill set.\n\n2. F1 students create jobs instead of taking away US workers jobs. Studies have shown that the international students are more likely to work on patent and R&D related jobs, which would open up more career opportunities in the US in general.

I would like to further comment on this notification. \n\nFirst of all, one of the significant reason that I decided to come to United States and pursue my Master Degree is that I know I will also have the opportunity to train my practical knowledge within the environmental engineering field. When I had my 17-month extension approved, I know this is a good amount of time that I will learn more from solving real world problems. However, it was a stunning to learn the OPT extension could possibly end next February. For science and engineering fields, it usually takes more time to finish projects. And I firmly believe the new proposed 24 months OPT STEM extension will help international students, including me, gain further practical experience.\n\nSecond, through applying new 24-month OPT STEM extension, US colleges/universities could attract more international students. It is reported by NCFSA that foreign students made totally $26.8 billion to the US economy during the period of 2013 to 2014. This contributes a lot to the public schools, government tax, and economy growth. For instance, I know some of my international friends who invest and create their own business after graduation. They are applying what they learned here to contribute to local communities.\n\nThird, the welcome environment for international students will also enhance the communication between different countries and culture. Since I arrived here, I have learned a lot of Western culture. My American friends have also learned Chinese culture (not only Kongfu). They told me it is really helpful to understand different people when they try to do business with them. As I see, the globalization requests us learn more about each other. The proposed 24 months OPT STEM extension will definitely attract more foreign students and enhance the understanding for different culture.\n\nFinally, it is irrational to say foreign students will take job positions and let more American people unemployed. Competition is everywhere. The best way to excel is to improve him/her instead of complaining others. If someone can complain  about international students, they could also complain about other higher-degree students or some more experienced workers. In early 1900's China had the policy to forbid communication with external culture and missed the opportunity to grow. USA is always famous for attracting all talents no matter what their backgrounds are and where they are from. International talents actually help the country to grow in the long-term perspective.\n\nThank you!\nYang", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yang Song", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16239", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this opt program. \nU.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anderson Wilson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13403", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose any rule that gives American employers a financial incentive to hire foreign students/graduates rather than American students/graduates.

The proposed rule gives U.S. corporations and universities the means to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination while denying American workers the same benefit of OPT. America needs to put Americans first by not kowtowing to the DHS and large corporations, who find this to be a lucrative program for hiring foreign workers at lower wages. If there is a shortage of workers in the technical and science sectors, then special monitoring programs should be equally available to Americans. America can't afford to spend billions on foreigners when a labor pool of Americans equally qualified already exists.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Chapman", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3458", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "America does not NEED the foreign workers employed here now.

In addition, hundreds of thousands of international students, most of whom are in F-1 status, have already chosen to enroll in U.S. educational institutions and are currently pursuing courses of study in fields that may provide eligibility for this program. Some of those students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. DHS must therefore act swiftly to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the 2008 IFR. Prompt action is particularly appropriate with respect to those students who have already committed to study in the United States, in part based on the possibility of furthering their education through an extended period of practical training in the world's leading STEM economy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by carol dan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18958", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "US is an opening country and you should give the most brilliant people the chance to work here!

Some of my friends gave up their offers from top universities in U.K. and came to the U.S. It is not only because universities in U.S. have high standards of teaching and advanced laboratories, but also because U.S. has friendly policies for international students, i.e. extension for OPT.

Without the working experience in the U.S., we lose a competitive strength comparing to other employees when we return to our countries.

I recommend this time period because the nature of the work of the STEM students, especially students in the Engineering field. For example, students who work in Civil/Environmental/Electrical/Mechanical Engineering industry, will often be involved in projects that need years to be completed. In most cases the students' participation in these projects will be required from the initial design phase to the construction/execution phase as well as the measurement and verification phase. It's very common that a construction project will take 10 years to be completed. 3 years is far from enough for students to gain meaningful experience, achieve actual real results and make real contribution to the companies/organizations; since the initial training would take up a long time. It will be a waste of resource and time for both the companies and students if the students have to leave when the project just started and the students just have gotten familiar with the industry and the operations of the companies. The short of enough practice time is also a factor that lower the competitiveness of international students in the job market, since the employer would not want to invest in training employees that only have very limited amount of time here in the companies. To conclude, in order to achieve the the goal of OPT - giving international students the opportunities to gain real, meaningful, valuable training experience as well as bringing actual benefit to the U.S. companies, I think OPT for STEM students should be extended for 3 more extra years, making a total 6 years training period. \n\nThank you,\nQiuhua Lu", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qiuhua Lu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2394", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is a very good proposal to extend the OPT by 24 months in place of 17 months as it will provide the students with an opportunity to train and hone their skills by working and implementing their ideas in the industry.

Few U.S. citizens working on the positions that most OPT students are working for. And more than half of OPT students are working for IT companies. These major IT companies, such as Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. cannot recruit enough workers without foreign students. Because of quota of H1B visa, many workers of these companies are still in OPT status to work in U.S. legally. If these workers are needed to leave America, these IT companies would possibly outsourcing their business to other low-income countries, such as India, China... If they do so, United States would lose its profit and skilled workers.\n\nAbove all, OPT extension is not only good for international students themselves but also good for economy in United States.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\n \n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\n \n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated in 2015 with a  master's degree in the field of Business Statistics. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\n \n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nYolanda X.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yolanda Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16240", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Most of the international students graduate with Bachelor, Master or PHD in an credited American school.

Revoking this policy will greatly discourage the motivation of potential international applicants to US universities, which will lead to a tremendous financial loss in a lot of industries, ranging from house renting, food catering and universities themselves. Remember a lot of state universities are subsidizing the local residents by charging several times higher tuition to the international students. If these universities suffer from a huge decrease of international students, then those local residents have to pay a higher tuition.\n\nSecondly, the booming of high-tech industry relies on the contribution of international students. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). In some way, the ability for US to keep these international STEM talents contributes to its long-term job stability and economic prosperity. The myopic, xenophobic and reckless action of overturning this policy will harm American's long-term welfare by sending these international talents to its potential competitors like Germany, Japan, and China. \n\nFinally, as a country founded by immigrants, diversity and opportunity are the unique labels of American dream. And American dream is not only for the current American citizens but also for those prospects, painstakingly working in the STEM field, fighting for their own life, and making contributions to America. Abolishing this policy is nothing but shutting the doors to those international STEM students who also embrace an American dream.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lingfeng Cheng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13091", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "YES!

A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand: (1) OPT denied American workers about 450,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and (2) OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to \"fund itself.\"\n\nThe original purpose of OPT was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned.  But today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the numerical H-1B cap.  I.e.,  DHS's currently proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.  There are approximately 570,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to about 100,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs.  Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of foreign workers undermines job opportunities for American STEM workers looking for work.  OPT participants are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (much cheaper) than their American counterparts. Employers save 7.65 percent of payroll when they hire foreign students instead of U.S. workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program.  OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60,000-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year in lost FICA and Medicare taxes.\n\nBy increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the federal Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent behind H-1B law.  There is also a major national security problem with OPT in that the DHS does not know where these foreign students are living and working in the country.  The GAO said that \"ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under OPT are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\"  Simply put, Congress intended OPT to be a temporary training program, not a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of American workers.\n\nIt is fictional that someone with a master's degree in a STEM field needs an additional three years to work as an intern (a low or no paid worker) to become a productive professional.  Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the Obama Administration believes it can \"get away with\" to illegally expand the substance of H-1B Congressional law by Executive fiat.  It's an obvious over-reach to claim that someone who completes a master's degree in as little as 12-24 months needs three additional years interning - at low or no pay in many cases - to get further training.\n\nLike almost all other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of (what used to be) the American middle class.  Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money due to ultra-cheap imported labor, in many cases not even being in the U.S. in accordance with Congressional immigration law.  DHS is neglecting its duty to implement Congressional immigration law faithfully and constructionistly in accordance with Congressional intent.\n\nNot only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes, creating an incentive not to hire American workers.  A 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.  Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact - wage suppression in tech-related fields.\n\nThe proposed OPT expansion is anti-American-worker, and should be shelved.  It is time now to greatly reduce legal immigration (we don't need more foreign workers to drive wages and American citizen employment further down), incarcerate and then deport illegal immigrants, and put AMERICANS back to work.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Stewart Engelman", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4527", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Dear officer,\n\nSTEM OPT extension becomes approachable only after a completion of 12 month of normal OPT.\n \nSTEM students will lose their work eligibility, projected career and life plan when OPT extension is revoked.

First of all, with extension time international student will be more likely to go abroad to study in the US, because they won't face the situation of getting only a degree without any practical working experience to support their future job track back to their home country. Secondly, US tech companies are developing rapidly these year, while the amount of tech people with higher education are not growing as fast as the demands. That's a major driver to extend STEM student longer time to work in the US. It's a severe condition that US tech companies are not able to hire purely US citizens to meet their developing needs while keep the cost reasonably low. So, to extend opt time is not only students' needs, but also US companies' needs. In the long run, if US could always attract high level tech people and keep them actively working for US companies, it is also a great thing for US economic growth. Those tech people are spending money for car/house/daily stuff as well as making profits for their companies. Some people may argue that foreigners are competing with native people for job opportunities, IT IS NOT TRUE. If a company could hire enough native, that's fine. The problem we are facing today is that we don't have enough well educated tech people.

Local economies: In the Silicon Valley, the number of STEM degree holders of foreign origin is high. A lot of international students come to the Bay Area after the completion of their degree. They are generally young and spend big. That obviously leads to a flourishing economy. \n\n2. Tourism: Being an international student, the United States is a place to explore. Most international students use the time they are here to tour the United States. Their contributions to the tourism in this country is, therefore, noteworthy.\n\nIt is a misconception that most international students are funded by the US taxpayers. Contrary to popular belief, most international students are here to pursue a Master's degree and they fund themselves. In a sense, the exorbitant, out-of-state tuition paid by them is keeping up a lot of universities and paying for the research those universities are doing.\n\nThe United States has built itself and placed itself at the top of the world by welcoming the best talent in the world apart from using its own. That's what makes it more advanced than other countries in the world.

However, that is impossible in the reality. \n\nFor example, I was looking for a position of energy engineer in US. A large number of companies even didn't consider about the foreign students for this position as a foreign students. For the rest of the companies, although they would like to consider the foreign students, the natives still have big advantages. The natives don't need EAD card, sponsorship, or green card. This kind of advantage can make them flexible to work anytime for any companies, and the human resource department of companies don't need to deal with a large number of documents. Only the positions that no natives are willing to take can be obtained by a foreign students. We can see this conditions all the time for the engineering companies. For myself, I finally found a position in a startup where no other natives would like to work. As you know, the natives who has the similar working ability and theoretical knowledge usually prefer the big successful companies to pursuit high staring points of their careers. I can only picked up the rest of the opportunities. \n\nThe reality tells us two points as following:\nFirstly, the foreign students can not compete with natives since the native has so many advantages. And a large part of the companies don't consider the foreign students. That means the natives still has the same job opportunities no matter the opt extension for STEM can been approved or not.\nSecondly, a lots of companies, especially the startups really need the foreign students to work for them since few natives would like to choose them. The approve of this policy is really important to their development, which would contribute to the development of American economy and industry finally. This kind of development also can offer more job opportunities for natives in the near future and improve the competitiveness in the whole world.\n\nThe above two reasons can strongly prove that the approve of this policy will be full of benefits.

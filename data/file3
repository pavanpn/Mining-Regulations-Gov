I believe that most international students came here for similar reasons. More and more developed countries offer better policies (good education/job opportunities, scholarships, lower tuition and living expenses, and so on) to attract international students, which means the future students have many more attractive options. I would say the new STEM OPT Extension is definitely a good way to boost competitiveness. \n\nIn fact, 17 month OPT extension is far away from enough for a STEM majored student to get real practical experience. Take myself as an example, I am currently working for a healthcare software company, using my 17 month OPT extension. It took me about 5 months to finish the induction training, including knowledge in software development and healthcare area, as well as all kinds of regulations and company policies. Then after the training, I did a lot of basic practice and further study. Because my code is going to save lives, I have to be well prepared (more than a year) before I get into a real project. A small project normally takes 1-2 years to develop and test, not to mention the endless maintenance. \n\nInternational students need more support on getting practical opportunities. The intern/job hunting experience is not an easy process for this foreign group. For one reason, international employees are not accepted by a lot of companies. For another reason, there are a lot of limitation for this group to work in U.S.A. for example, you have to submit a bunch of extra materials for DHS review. I appreciate those companies which give us opportunities and I am very happy to dedicate my intelligence and knowledge for them during the time when I stay here. \n\nHistorically, international students have made significant contributions to this country, not only for the U.S, economy, but also for the culture diversity and technology development. International students have paid a huge amount of tuition and other expenditures, including the cost of family travels. In addition, international students, especially STEM students, contribute a lot in scientific research, high-tech, and financial areas.\n\nI vote YES! \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaofang Yu, Epic", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9284", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.

America has a brilliant project of university education that students have a time to practice after graduated from U.S. University, which is OPT.Without OPT or OPT-extension, students will lose the chances to do internships or corporations in this country, the merits of Studying in U.S. will lose a lot.As we know, undertaking revenue is one of the important revenue of a country, the government must values it.I believe especially as a powerful country as America won`t miss it. \n\n2.International Students in U.S.do very value the OPT and OPT-EXTENSION. And it is also a reason that students apply for U.S university to study. However, OPT is very limited, students could have made more contributions to the US and themselves,if it be extended. Due to no OPT-EXTENSION,those excellent international students have to leave U.S. before they contribute more for the country.It is such a big regret for both of U.S. and students.Practices need time and experiences, nobody could master their study and work immediately. \n\n3.International students spend a lot in U.S. University,they should obtain more chances to raise themselves and practice the knowledge that they learned from U.S. People learned the knowledge and they should practice and apply to the works,Without experience, people will ignorant to the value of knowledge they have absorbed.And students spend a long-term to learn in U.S.,they have adapted to American pattern,so the best area to practice is U.S absolutely. \n\n4.

However, lots of us didn't get the equivalent opportunities (or even a opportunity ) as U.S graduates to get a job and work in USA because of OPT expiration. This is unfair to international students. \n\nSecondly, from my perspective, providing international STEM students more time to work in US would only help US job marketing rather than making US citizens become unemployed. According to US Bureau of Labor Statistics(http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm), for software industry(where I am studying now), the job openings are increasing dramatically. It states the increasing trend would stay about 22% each year to 2020, which means by that time, there will be 3 million more jobs than number of jobs in 2012. I strongly believe that by increasing the STEM OPT period would allow more qualified international students to fill the gap, and improve the industry. \n\nThirdly, from my personal opinion, the most important reason that makes USA stay as the world top class country is because of its culture diversity. It respects and encourages excellent people from all over the world to come to USA to pursue their goals and careers in all kinds of fields. This is the reason why USA can develop so many creative products, or establish so many leading companies to improve people's lives. Both Youtube and Yahoo's founders (Jerry Yang and Steve Chen) are Taiwanese, and I can count all nights for excellent foreigners who achieved amazing success in US and provided tons of job openings for US citizens. I could not image what people like Jerry Yang and Steve Chen would do if they had to struggle for an OPT extension when they just graduated from school.     \n\nTherefore, based on the above reasons, I strongly support this new regulation. \n\nTo be honest, as an international student, I feel very sad to see so many people who born in US writing so many rude comments to oppose this regulation even without a very subject reason. Their actions would only make people from other countries think US as a very unfriendly country, a country full of bias, disrespect.

However this win-win situation may not continue since the OPT is too short to allow the student to have enough time to get a working visa. Thus as a consequence, the company may lose a hard working employee, and this student will lose his or her job.

Following are the reasons why this policy will benefit US employers and the international students in the STEM fields:\n1.\tUnited States has long history of attracting people from all around the world, especially who are highly educated, to work and contribute to this country. People with different nation origin, race, and color worked together and made the history of this country. Without policy like this, the U.S. close the door for many highly educated people to come; and this will bring more harm than benefit to this country. Attracting more talented people working in STEM field will help to boost the technology and economy of this country and results in more job opportunities for everyone. \n2.\tThis new policy will help the U.S. still be competitive to attract international students in the STEM field. Other countries, such as Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand are all working on publishing new policies to attract students come to study. Since OPT allows STEM students to expand their study experience outside the classroom setting, and apply what theyve learned to benefit the companies, this policy makes the U.S. a more appealing place for students to study abroad. \n3.\tThis policy clearly states that only E-verify companies can hire OPT students, and this rule eliminate the chance of discriminating the local people. E-verify companies are not allowed to discriminate people from other countries, and definitely not American citizens. \n4.\tSTEM fields need more people to contribute in, and due to how many Americans are in these fields, only depend on U.S. citizens cannot fulfill this need. If this policy doesnt exist, many high tech companies will face huge difficulty to find enough people to meet the need, and this will lead to negative impact on technology and economy.\n5.\t24-month extension is a reasonable time. Many engineering projects and research programs are typically 2-3 years. The 24-month extension help the companies to complete these projects without any delay or interrupt due to International students have to go back to home country as their OPT expired. \n6.\tWhile U.S. citizens are worried about foreigners take their jobs, this condition doesnt exist at all! Quite the opposite, international students are facing more challenges to find jobs.  Most employers are seeking for stable work force, but most international students will back to their home countries after 2-3 years. This is not ideal for the employers. If the employers want to keep the student for longer, they need to apply H1-B visa for the student and this process cost substantial amount of money. Employers are not blind to these facts. How can employers choose international students over citizens if they can find enough citizens to meet their needs? \nTo wrap up, this policy is beneficial to both employers and international students. The worry about causing local people harder to find jobs is absolutely unnecessary. Thus, I strongly support this new policy. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cecily Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19104", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The new proposed extension does not affect me personally, because I do not have a STEM degree. However, as the anti-immigration voice from some domestic community is mounting, I think it is a good time to review, rationally, the benefits F-1 students have contributed to the U.S. in the aggregate, compared to how little the U.S. has done for them in the past decades. \n\nFirst, F-1 students have made great investments for their education in the U.S. These investments not only include the money paid for the education, but also the time, efforts and social resources they expended on establishing their reputation as young scholars and professionals. Such investments make U.S. universities more diversified and accordingly, more competitive and attractive to those most talented in the world. The United Kingdom (UK) was a predecessor in terms of benefiting from foreign students' investments, and for those countries that followed UK's model, it is difficult to argue that the actual benefits they have received is anything less than what was expected from foreign students.   \n\nSecond, the argument that the extension of OPT period for STEM students will negatively impact the domestic working class is ill-grounded, because most of the jobs currently available in the labor market do not require a STEM degree and students with STEM degrees are not allowed to work in positions unrelated to their degrees. \nPerhaps one may argue that the penetration of well-educated foreigners have raised the threshold of entry-level labor market. But this is irrelevant to the issue of whether STEM students have formed a substantial threat to those people without such a degree. Furthermore, the U.S. has long cherished fair competition and has, based on history, grown strong as a nation by encouraging competitions in various aspects of society. Therefore, it is not justified to assume that the increasing numbers of competent STEM students will do any harm to the U.S. labor market. Quite to the contrary, the more competent STEM students come into the market, the more evident that the educational programs in U.S. universities are of high quality and successful.\n\nFinally, the 12-month OPT period is harsh enough for F-1 students as it is. Compared to the investments made by F-1 students, the reward or payback they receive after graduation is minimal. Most of them have been trained at graduate schools to become professionals, yet they find themselves in a situation where their years of education can not ever earn them an opportunity for a return offer. In addition, many well-qualified professionals are forced to leave the U.S. after being a dedicated members of those high-tech firms and corporations, even founders of profitable star-ups whose work have contributed a great deal to IRS. Extension is a way to keep those with great accomplishments to stay, and instead of occupying currently available jobs, those beneficiaries are the most likely to create new employment opportunities. \n\nBasically, those arguments against OPT extension for STEM students are saying the same thing: you've got the education you desired, we've got your money, and off you go. If this is the legislative intention, then the U.S. will be driving those intelligent people somewhere else, where their talents and competence are valued and welcomed.\n\n\n\n\n \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoyi Liang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14621", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is good for F-1 students since they have more time to gain international working experience.

As someone who have lived in the Bay area and Stanford for more than 5 years, I have something to say. \n\nThe immigrant-friendly culture in U.S. has been attracting the world's most talented people, and made US the best country in the world. The contribution of immigrants who obtained their green card following an advanced degree is essential, especially for the silicon valley. Researcher and writer Vivek Wadhwa has shown that almost a majority (43%) of Silicon Valley companies founded in the last 7 years had at least one immigrant founder. Just looking at the top 10 companies based in Silicon Valley by NASDAQ market cap, many (40%) are run by someone who is a woman, an immigrant, or non-white. By individual demographics,  30% of the CEOs are immigrants who either obtained their degrees in the U.S. (before green card) or the kids of parents with degrees in the U.S. (before immigration). Two good examples are google founder Sergey Brin and current google CEO Sundar Pichai. They are both Stanford Ph.Ds and immigrant (or the kid of immigrants) with STEM degrees. \n\nAfter living in the U.S. for these many years, I am in love with this country, mostly due to the friendly culture of the United States. I don't feel like being treated as a foreigner, and start to plan to live here after graduation. The world is changing fast. U.S. is no longer the only country who can pay us with 100K $ a year. With our Ph.D degree from the U.S., we can also find jobs with competitive pay in other countries, such as in UK, China and Singapore. We stay here because we love this country and we are loved and cared by the people and government of this country. If rules are keeping us out of the country, why should we keep staying here since we have the power to find equally excellent jobs in our home country? I think many international students have the same feeling. \n\nThe knowledge and skills we learned here in the U.S. are more valuable than the job offers or H1B visas, because they will give us the power to work excellently in anywhere of the world.  I feel very grateful to the U.S. institutions who provide financial aid and student positions to international students.

Think about this, if all of a sudden, these diligent loyal people have to leave due to the non-extented OPT, what would happen to the companies and US economy? Someone would argue that local people can also do the same job. However, in addressing this argument, not all companies can respond very quickly to such a huge loss of personnel, which would slow down the growth significantly. Secondly, a simple statistics of college and graduate school students majors show that students from China and India take up most part of the STEM majors. If so, how could local people fill in the positions to the fullest in a short period of time? \n\nSpeaking of economic re-flourishing, the contribution by this vast portion of STEM students is not limited by the work force itself, but also in almost every other aspects, such as traveling, life expenses and so on. Take a simple example of one of my friends who got OPT. Due to the work reason, he couldn't fly back to China too often. Thus, his parents would fly here to US a lot of times a year. As we read in news, such people flow from China to US contributes tremendously in consumption and a lot of stores are hiring Chinese staff. This would be another latent loss for US economy if OPT extension is not approved.\n\nThirdly, OPT extension is not something that will guarantee that a student in STEM will stay that long, unless he or she is really recognized by the company. Thus, the arguments that these students will rob the jobs of the local would not be valid. This is a society proud of its fair competition. If the foreign students are not as good, they won't be hired for that long most likely. And this is the same case for the local. Thus, to ensure the local job rate by pushing out foreigners would be an unhealthy way, which would even jeopardize the foundation of the US constitution and the creed this land holds for.\n\nStill more to say, but just summarize to a point that this issue would need to be treated positively, in an unbiased manner.

Why OPT is needed?\nTo attract the international talents to the United States is almost guaranteed a crucial contributing factor to the economy of the United States. When deciding where to pursue the advanced/higher education, the OPT (and OPT STEM) opportunity plays a key role to a lot of international students. I studied in a top-3 college in China for my undergraduate, majoring in mathematics. Over 90% of my classmates who chose to study abroad came to United States. In addition to the excellent academic resources, the opportunity to study and practice with OPT is a very strong advantage for the United States over the European countries, even if European universities provide more available scholarship chances for graduate studies. \n\n2. Why STEM extension is needed?\nThe length of OPT program actually determines the effect of the practice training. For research and development divisions, where most STEM students work, 12 months is essentially too short to output any impactful product/service to the United States. To extend the OPT duration for the international student who are in STEM is to help the company to achieve more and make more contribution to the economy of the United States, and help the STEM students to grow himself/herself more in terms of skills and knowledge.\n\n3. Future influences\nThe economy of United States actually is not an isolated economy. It goes accordance with the economy of the whole world. Big players in technology, such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, are actively attempting to enter the Asian market further. If the STEM students are able to get enough experience in the United States with OPT and OPT extension, it will eventually benefit these companies when the students decide to go back and work for their own countries.

For example, I did my internship in a big IT company during this summer. During my internship, its the first time for me to notice how different it is for working on a course project in a two-member team and working on a real-industry project. It does really take a lot of time to learn the codebase, framework and tools used by the team. Also, it needs experience accumulation to work productively and efficiently. I once asked my mentor how long did he expect an entry-level engineer to finish the transition period to work productively for the company? The answer is 2 years. Its obvious to see that a one-year OPT is absolutely not enough for a STEM student to earn enough practicing experience and also, it must be a loss for the company to lose a potentially productive employee just after one year training. \n\n\nSecondly, for the concerns expressed earlier, such as OPT allowing employers to depress wages. DHS proposes to modify the terms and conditions for employer participations in the STEM OPT extension to protect U.S. workers, such as the rule below:\n\nIf the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers, the employer would be required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment. \n\"\n\nThe new rule enhances the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. Also, Only companies in the E-Verify program are eligible for OPT extension, which prevents unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. Furthermore, the Mentoring and Training program is also provided to ensure that students will work on the major-related area using OPT, in the way, the abuse of OPT can be prevented to a large extent. \n\n\nThirdly, considering the large amount of people working on the OPT extension, terminating the OPT extension will bring a disaster to the labor market and companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Linkedin will face huge problems. Kicking off the skilled foreign talents does not mean plenty of opening jobs, but the lack of technical support for products, the termination of on-going projects, and huge disruption in the economic. The sensible way of solving the employment problem is not protecting citizens by preventing foreigners to make contributions to this country, but provide a integrity mechanism for diverse workforce to boost the economy, like what DHS is doing. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bo  Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16054", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!\nFirstly, we get our education, learned our knowledge in US, why shouldn`t we contribute our knowledge to US society?\nSecond, United States has always been considered as a well diversified country.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\n\nIt is my sincere desire that you will not go through with this blatant un-American proposal. \n\n\n\nCopyright  2015 StopOverreach.com \n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kathleen Raby", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9401", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Since STEM majors are the most popular areas in both education and technology, top universities around USA are attracting thousands of international students to study abroad and pursue their higher degrees.

Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation.

People who have studied STEM related majors play crucial role in the development of US technology, economics.  Unfortunately, more and more american students would rather choose to study in business school,  medical school and law school and fewer and fewer american students are interested in STEM majors.  It is of great importance for america to launch policies to attract more and more international students to study in the US and make their contributions to the US. The 1 -year OPT allows international students to make their contribution for short term but does not have the ability to keep those students continuously making their  contribution. The short term OPT policy would force the international students to leave after their 1-year practical training. As a result, the US universities and the companies/institutions would play a role helping other countries educate and train talents. A longer OPT (for example, 36-month OPT) would allow international students to make longer contribution to the US. More importantly, the US government should try their best to keep the excellent students(for example graduate students, PhD students) in the US instead of forcing them to leave. In particular, the US universities usually invest a lot in a international PhD students (at least $200, 000). It is insane if those students are force to make contributions for other countries just because they are foreigners.    \n  ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ryan C", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16849", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this decision.

As a scientist in an academic institute, I have to say, Extension of OPT has benefitted the institutes and science areas for many reasons. \n1)  OPT extension provide more candidates for institutes to seek better trainees (such as postdocs) regardless their citizenships. Compared with J-type scholars, International scholars who obtained their degrees in the U.S usually have less- language and cultural barriers and can quickly fit into a new position in their own fields. Compared with citizens, OPT-students have more pressure to be productive to keep their temporary positions. \n2) Extension of OPT saves money and time for the institutes.  Without OPT extension, many scientists (on-OPT extension) who are operating an ongoing projects will be forced to change their immigration status ( H1). Advisors have to waste their time for documentation and have to sponsor the additional money to keep those scholars. Otherwise, they have to find other candidates and restart everything and re-train others. Time is so priceless for Science competition,  the additional time for seeking and training a new project leader can turn out to be a disaster.  Generally speaking, three years of OPT is a good time-frame for finishing a biological project, as such, scholars and institutes can focus on their research without bothering documentation and other distraction for one or two projects. \n3) Extension of OPT contributes to test the \"qualified expert\" for science area without threatening the local job market.  If  a student on his or her OPT is not competitive, he or she will not be hired anyway, there is no threat for the job market for other employers. If a student is very competitive, they will obtain their job soon. Healthy competition is a respect for all employers and job market. However, one-year OPT is only sufficient for providing a position for a student, but two additional years would be fair for institutes to evaluate their employees a and provide the further supports for  the real  \"qualified expert.\" Compared with other strategies, Extension of OPT seems to be the most efficient way so far. \n\nI appreciate the efforts that HSD has made and I honestly wish that more people can understand- extension of OPT never means to steal the job opportunities from other people. It just provides employers and organization more choices for seeking their qualified employees.

I am working by OPT right now, and that process didnt go perfectly actually. That long, tedious process made me anxious because I wasnt sure if I could get my OPT and start my job as the date address in the offer letter. I didnt know what to do, and my roommate, a local American girl, told me to try to contact Senator. Wait, Senator? Can we actually talk to them? Arent they busy with billions of problems among the country? Would they love to help me when I wasnt even paying taxes for the state of Michigan? I had to try this eventually out of no way. Then they (probably the staff working for them, but still pretty amazing) replied my email in an hour. Then I got official reply in a day. Then I got my OPT two days after.\n \nWow. WOW. I just fell in more love with this amazing country. How you care about people, even when they are not YOUR people. I told myself, Shuang, do your best at work and contribute what you have to the well-being of this country. And thats what I have being doing at my job. I enjoy serving the communities in state of Michigan at work when I perform audits for them, as well as volunteering at charities to do good to others.\n \nIts not that we dont contribute. We do, especially the F-1 students with jobs like me. If OPT expires next year though, I would have to go back to China as my salary doesnt meet the H1B requirement. Have I contributed less though just because I make less money? No. I contribute as much as I can because I have this fire in my heart making me passionate and willing to do whatever I can do to develop the United States of America.\n \nThe United States of America has always been an open and gracious country to immigrants around the world. We, as F-1 students equipped with expertise, will help contribute in building the promising future of the United State of America, if you could grant us this opportunity. I sincerely ask you to consider the extension for all F-1 students, as we all contribute in the way that we are driven by our hearts of loving the US.

While Section G of the Proposal extends protection to existing U.S. workers, i.e. prohibiting employers from replacing U.S. workers with F-1 students, there are no provisions that deter employers from hiring F-1 students instead of U.S. students. In other words, employers are not allowed to fire U.S. workers in order to hire F-1 students, but they are allowed to hire F-1 students instead of U.S. students even if there are qualified U.S. students want to work. Employers should only be allowed to hire F-1 students if there are no available qualified U.S. students. \n\nWe need to protect U.S. students who graduate with STEM degrees. U.S. students graduate in STEM and still don't find jobs. In the last seven years, they not only have been burdened by the recession but have also been burdened by the colossal influx of competition from foreign students caused by the expansion of the OPT and H1-B programs. Big Tech companies argue that there is a shortage in STEM labor. (One could infer if that there were a shortage of STEM labor, that U.S. students should have little trouble in finding jobs.) However, this alleged labor shortage is probably a myth. There are numerous recent articles that suggest there is a surplus of U.S. STEM labor rather than a shortage. For example, \"STEM Grads Are at a Loss\" by U.S. News & World Report and \"America Has More Trained STEM Graduates than STEM Job Openings\" by the Center for Immigration Studies both allude to the point I am making.\n\nMoreover, the proposal only makes reference to studies made in 2008 that suggest there is shortage in STEM labor (Section G par. 1). While those studies may have been accurate in 2008, they are outdated now.  Since the economic environment has changed substantially since the time of these studies,  a new and impartial study should be conducted in order to determine if there truly exists a STEM labor shortage, and we should conduct this study before making rules that change the OPT program.  If there is in fact a STEM labor surplus rather than a shortage and if it is true that a large portion U.S. students who graduate with STEM degrees cannot find jobs in their field following graduation, then extending the OPT program would certainly harm U.S. students. The bottom line is that we must first ensure that U.S. students have opportunities to learn from on-the-job training before we can become concerned with the needs of foreign students. Extending the OPT program now would be rash. We shouldn't jump to a decision without thoroughly understanding how the decision will impact U.S. students. \n\n\n\n\nIf anyone wishes to receive additional feedback from me, feel free to contact me the email address above.

Solar companies in the U.S. have been experiencing hard times due to the fact that the levelized cost of installing a solar panel on one's roof is still much higher than the price of grid electricity. Nevertheless, solar industry is still growing - together with the demand of solar panels - in the past few years due to policies like solar tax incentives. Unfortunately, this tax credit will expire in 2016 (http://solar.gwu.edu/q-a/will-congress-extend-solar-tax-incentives-expiring-2016) and a lot of policymakers in California don't believe it will be extended. \n\nDue to the expiration of the tax credit, solar companies in U.S. will definitely experience another critical moment because of the shrinking demand. Since solar energy is a highly important energy source, and a breakthrough in the solar research may reduce the cost of solar panels so that they can again survive even without solar tax incentives, providing enough support to solar researchers/companies is crucial. A lot of the solar researchers in U.S. are international students (e.g. http://yylab.seas.ucla.edu/members.html). Expanding training opportunities for those STEM F1 students may increase their chances of continuing their research work in a US company, and therefore increase the overall chance of a breakthrough in solar.

I'm an international computer science master student from China and was a software engineer at China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in some other countries. The most important reason I came to study here is because US could provide me the industry training opportunity and a lot of golden job opportunities during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents and parts of their development team are formed by people who are using their OPTs.  \n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience, mostly a large software project would last at least 2 years or even longer than that. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion. That would be a big loss for both individuals and workers. In Computer Science industry, if you change developers before the completion of project, that will have a high possibility for project to be failed finally.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development and gained enough experience from working with teams in the US. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nThank you so such for considering this rule and I hope more people could see this and come to support this.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jermaine Ding", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20972", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Absolutely should support this regulation!

OPT Extension to 24 months is necessary and benefit to US economy as well as the world's economy.There are three main reasons for why it is necessary and benefit.\n\n   First, international students plays an important part in the Computer Science industry market in US. I am an international student major in computer science in Stevens Institute of Technology.  What I have seen is most of our students in computer science department are Indian and Chinese. And my friends who are in Columbia University, King's Collage, UCLA, Northeast University and Seattle University see the same situation as I do. Those huge part of International students accepted US education, learn English and find jobs in US, they build 3D printers for constructions, create robots or machines for modern lives, build start ups to serve people,  producing cars, creating models of finance or bankings. Once they are illegal to stay in US, who could help continuing these valuable creations or innovations. And what should be doing to fulfill those gaps? Isn't it a lose of US economy?\n\n  Second, there are still a big shortage of computer science engineers for the technology industry. As I see in meet ups. Big companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, IBM, Apple and so on, still need  large quantity of engineers. even if Google has sixty thousand of employees, and Facebook has twenty thousands. Assuming that 10% of google employees have to go to their own countries annually, how many product lines should be killed? how to maintain their qualities and stabilities. The lost of engineers equals to lost of moneys in today's world. Further more, I could say it is US education who are better than any other countries attracting so many excellent students all over the world, isn't it a lost of talent for reduce the OPT extension?  \n\n  Finally, it is the poverty not wealthy people who want to immigrant to US. Most of international students can afford the tuition fees of US education. Those students are only in their 20's, they are too young to determine where to stay where to live not to say no parents no friend no relatives in US. To maintain a good education and have a sharp experience in their resume is good. 1 year is not enough to say in the resume. \n\n  All of the above, OPT extension have to be extent to 24 months.

Diversity is one of the core value for the U.S. spirit. Keeping students from different background will stimulate the global cultural communication as well as develop the global vision of U.S. students. Moreover, these cultural communication and interaction of interest will brings opportunities of developing global entrepreneurship. For example, there are many international students participating in the startup companies initiated by American students in the Sillicon Valley. And they grant potential for these startups to grow into global businesses.\n\n3. Many students wish to gain working experiences before they left U.S. for contributing their mother countries. The U.S. working experiences will be a competitive remark on their resume. And they are not neccessarily competing with the local citizens since they are not targeting at perminant jobs. The emerging market in Asia has granted rewarding positions for students with US education and working experiences.

Companies that only need common people to do common work would prefer not to sponsor this because that would be a big cost for them, which means F1 students who could find jobs here in United States are usually more competitive than others.

From the data of H1b, we could find that a large number of them works for IT industry. As we all know, many of IT companies create more jobs for common people like Uber and Airbnb. Also, another feature of IT industry is that customers would not care much about where the product was made. In other words, if many F1 student, who could have stayed here and improved many companies competence, went back to their country or to other countries, some companied from other countries might grow and get the cake from companies in United States (with their lower labor cost and relatively worse but still qualified product).\n\nIn conclusion, although some people are concerned that F1 students would \"rob\" their jobs, but I believe this is shortsighted and the extension would only contribute to a healthier job market and United States' prosperity.

The percentage of international students in almost every university is increasing every year. They contribute a lot to the American education system through the huge amount of tuition they paid. Just be honest, it would be a totally disaster for all American universities if they lose these money. We all know the truth that the American universities need money while those international students coming from developing counties want better education and working experience. It is a deal reached between U.S. and international students. Now this deal was denied by the American court. But ironically the students couldn't get refunded because they have took the service, which is just not as good as what has been promised at the very beginning. The F-1 students get screwed. what else. The American education will also get hurt, not now but in the future. Surely, there would be still lots of students investing in American education. But the reputation of American education will no longer exist. The American education is now the top in the world. But will it still be if nobody trying to remedy this mistake. we will see. \n \nThe major reason for people to oppose STEM OPT program is about the adverse effect to U.S. workers. But this reason is ungrounded. The program is only working for students with STEM degrees. And most of them would probably end working in technology related companies. Those companies hire the employees based on their abilities and skills. And if you are not qualified for it now, you will be still not qualified even if the STEM OPT program is not passed. The high unemployment rate and competitive environment are due to the global economic recession not the STEM OPT program. Those people who complain about OPT program do not realize the true reason why they didn't get jobs. Suppose the OPT program is not passed, the situation will just become worse and worse. The high-tech companies lose tons of talents, which will in turn hurt the American economy. At that time, it will be more difficult for Americans to find jobs.\n\nOverall, the proposal for the new STEM OPT program is a win-win decision for everyone. I hope people consider it wisely.\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaohong Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19863", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal because this will contribute U.S. and our citizens in the following aspects, just to be brief:\nFirstly, foreign students contributes diversity ideas and financial benefits to U.S. University.

USA is the most powerful country in the world, she is attracting international students from all over the world because she is able to provide the best education and tons of opportunities to help all of the people to realize their American dreams. \n\n2. USA is an open country. Different people and cultures co-exist in this prosperous community where everyone is contributing. After International students in STEM finished their colleges, they become well-educated and self-motivated. International students are eager to devote themselves to this country, so that this country becomes better and better for everyone. \n\n3. This OPT-extension allows international students to work for 2 years without H1B visa, which will definitely help the economics of this country to grow. IT giants such as Google, Facebook are supported by thousands of internationals who graduated in American universities. Not all of them are working under H1B visa, there are still a significant amount of them who are working under OPT or OPT extension. The risk of not passing this OPT-extension is negatively influencing the country economy: it means not only the working status of the internationals under current OPT will become invalid soon, but also will reduce the workforce from the internationals who will be graduating next year. Internationals will face this problem: 1 year of OPT, then go back home if not get H1B. The result not only will lead to lots of working-under-OPT internationals' working permit becomes invalid, lots of work being done will have to be stopped, but also will reduce the attraction of USA. The majority of internationals pay their tuition when study, pay their tax all the time, and contribute to the country economy when they work. So the benefits of OPT-extension will surely push this country's economy forward. \n\n4. I admit there will be competition between internationals and us-citizen in terms of job opportunities. However, I don't think this competition is bad at all. Why? Since students in STEM are studying the subjects that only covers a small amount of job opportunities. Students in computer science major won't be able to find a job as a salesman in a shop. The major is actually bounding the job opportunities of the internationals. However, as for the same major competition, I think this is even better, since the competition will increase the overall quality of the workforce, and thus generate more achievements in economy. Let's take IT industry as an example, IT giants are so huge that only us-citizens in IT fields are not enough, more workforce then are recruited from internationals. These giants need also hands from internationals in the areas of extending their business in international countries. \n\nOverall, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal and hope this proposal can contribute to the USA as it used to be. \n\nThank you,\nRui Yan", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rui Yan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16024", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The best thing that could happen for tha USA would be Send BO (our POTUS) to the Middle East and say these these three words he told the American people,I am Christian   Long live the USA in spite of what BO has done to our nation....CAF", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Carl Finger", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5970", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally agree with this proposal.

The regulation will surely increase the overall benefit of US as a whole\n\nAs we all know, students are foreign countries, especially from Indian, China, are very intelligent and hard-workding. They are very talented in areas like computer science and computer engineering. Many of those students will end up working in the computer industry. With those students, the IT industry will grow stronger, bigger. Technology is the key to success for a country nowadays. Giving those students more time will give a huge boost to the IT technology in US, increase the competitiveness of US in the international market. \n\nThere are many students working on OPT for big companies like GOOGLE, MICROSOFT or Amazon. If this rule is suddenly revoked, tens of thousands of students will be greatly affected. Companies hiring those students will also suffer a great loss and it may take a long time for them to recover from this loss.\n\nAs other may point out that foreign students may take jobs from US people, I cannot agree on this. Today, this whole world is becomming more and more interconnected. Globalization is not only a tread, but a result. Free market, free trading, equal opportunity are the major ideas behind national relationship these days. Limiting the opportunity of others is not the way of solving the unemployment. The real problem is whether US are strong enough to compete with other countries in the world. Moreover, because of the highly intertwined global economy, this kind of job limitation may no longer work anymore. Companies could choose to move to other developing countries like China, Brazil to lower their cost and increase their competitiveness. This will hurt even more to the welfare of US people. This is what capitalism is all about. Let the market do the job.\n\nAbout 80% of the foreign students are working in industry like computer science or electric engineer. These areas are the weak spots for the American students, who loves to become athletes, lawyer. So foreign students and American students does not form a very strong competitive relationships. Foreign students are more like supporters of the US economy, instead of competitors. \n\nThe last point to mention is that most of the foreign students are very kind and easy-going. They travel such a long distance to study, to experience America culture. They bring money with them. After the work, they pay the taxes without enjoying much benefit America people can get out of the government.

Companies in STEM fields, which make up the bulk of America's edge over other countries, need talented employees to outpace their pursuers. Many of the tasks performed require mastery that only hard work, industry and time investment can attain, which, incidentally, embodies the quintessential American Dream. \n\nIn terms of job searching, American citizens have natural advantages over non-citizens through immigration regulations, it costs a fortune for companies to employ foreign students. But the fact companies keep on hiring foreign students imply a deep deficit in qualified citizens to take those positions. \n\nOf course, it can be argued that the reason to prefer foreign students are their low starting wages. But there are other costs involved. Many of the jobs require companies investing time and resources to train newcomers, with only a one-year OPT program, most of the foreign students will have to leave because they cannot get a H1B visa within their first years. The companies will loose their investment. Companies need to stay alive, and they are not stupid, if they could find enough qualified Americans, they will. \n\nAnother point to consider is the PhD market. A large proportion of PhD graduated in American institutions are of foreign origin, they have spent many years, often more than 5 years in training for their degree, mostly with fundings from government agencies, aka Taxpayer's money. Once they have learned their advanced skills with American money, they also have to face the lottery-- a lottery with no regard to their talent. \n\nA 2-year OPT extension increases their chances to stay, and allow companies the peace of mind to training their new employees. It also allows companies enough time to make a better judgement on their new recruits, so that only the best will remain in the country. \n\nThe fact that many Americans oppose the new 2-year OPT extension in fact belies a far more worrying concern: that have the American people lost their own Dreams?  It seems that in the relative peace and security of their own home, people have become lazy. Every person is born equal, most have similar intelligence, even the foreign students. If they can achieve importance in this country through hard work and industry, so can most Americans. While of course people can oppose foreign students through administrative red tapes, it makes more sense to simply work harder to take their job back, it's a solution that will work forever to the country's advantages.

OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n\nRichard Trumpka, President AFL/CIO has presented the following facts about the program:\n\n\"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out ! of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nDavid North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department is on record stating the follwing: \n\n\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has! nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\n\n\nThe 911 Terrorist would qualify under this regulation.

They are talented and hardworking people. Normally its much harder for them to find a job in the U.S. since the selection process for these students are usually more competitive and the level of requirements are much higher. \n-google 1point3ac\n2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many scientist that has contributed a lot to the growth of technologies and economy of U.S. are foreigners. They came up with brilliant ideas and make them come true and these ideas has helped U.S. to become a stronger country and also improved the lives of American people. \n\n3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students are working with a salary much higher than the minimum wage and this actually helped to improve the minimum wage in the district. International students will not compete on jobs with local citizens since they need to go through a much tougher selection process during hiring process in order to get a job in U.S.\n\n4. Companies in the U.S. are growing so fast in the past few years and many of them are starting overseas business. This will require these companies to increase the demand of international employers. Many working positions that international students are working on actually require international sights and skills like multilingual skills and multicultural background. This is not saying that local citizens in the U.S. are not doing so well in learning another language or another culture. This can cultivate a good competitive environment that helps both international employers and local employer to grow.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yijing Xiao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11666", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM-related job positions require specific skills with higher bar than other positions, and they are usually offered by industrial corporations like IT companies from CA and fundamental research institutes like national labs.

It grows to be a strong and top one country because of the open policy, which gives everyone equal rights and opportunities to make their own contribution to the development of the country. The immigration policy is just one of these kinds of open policy. The STEM OPT extension policy provides the equal right and opportunity to the STEM students in the job market, and gives them chances to work for this country and contribute to this country. The Americans actually wont be able to live a day without immigrants.\nSecondly, some may argue that we already have enough STEM workers, US citizens or foreigners, and we dont need more. The world is changing every day. The reason you have enough STEM workers is partially because of the current 17 months extension policy, which helps to keep available STEM workers stay in this country and contribute to this country. This extension policy is proposed due to the changing of the world. If you dont live with changes, you lose and you will immediately be in a situation of short of STEM workers. Believe it or not, you dont want to experience that situation.\nThirdly, even you do believe you have enough STEM workers of US citizens, this policy increases the competition. Competition makes progress. It is exactly because of this strong competition to make this country strong. If you want to live in a strong country, you have to give it chance to be strong. If you just see that you lose the competition to a foreigner and think about your own benefit, this country wont grow to be strong. It may seem unfair to the US citizens who fails in the competition for a moment, but it is good for the whole country, which will be good to them in return eventually. You do have to realize that the foreigners could fail the competition too, and once they fail, they wont have chances to have the good return. This extension policy helps to keep the strong and good ones. So, for those who win, you should thank them for their contribution to your good life.\nLastly, I have to say I am impressed by how smart the politicians in this country. This whole immigration policy, including the OPT, OPT extension, H1-B, and green card, is a perfect bait for STEM graduates. People tend to fight for something hard to get, which usually means more precious or helps to prove their excellence. It is supposed to be hard to keep the outstanding STEM foreign graduates to stay and make contributions to this country, but the immigration policy makes this possible and easy because it really catches the personal psychology. I would say the OPT extension policy is just a little mercy,actually another bait, that the country shows to the foreigners who are going to make huge contributions to this country. \nIn sum, if there is no such policy, the country would definitely attract less outstanding foreigners to stay. And, of course, no best people, no best country. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Liping Zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19645", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The culture of USA is always welcoming people with enthusiasm and capacity aboard and providing them a good standing to contribute to this continent.

I am a international graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 42% of MIT graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas.

Im particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. I am planning on using OPT after graduation to continue my research as a post-doctoral researcher. OPT and OPT extension is important to be because it will provide necessary time allowance to advance my research to the extent that will potentially have practical utility.\n\nI am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension or the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule. \n\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYinqing Li\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yinqing Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19350", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree to this new rule for stem major students. As we know, U.S is in a phase facing the great change of the world. During the last several decades, many other countries are coming to a strong developing period, like India and China. Many of their young students are studying engineering and science majors. As we know, our country is prominent for engineering and science, that's how we lead the most advanced technology.\n\nHowever, since such majors require very hardworking process to achieve degree and qualify industry needs. Many of our teens, students dislike to pursue in these fields. Even for the very few amount who finally choose to study in these areas, they fear the job opportunities to be occupied by international students.\n\nIn my opinion, I believe this worry or fear is overhead. Our nation still requires endless engineering and science people to work so as to catch up and maintain our leading level in the world. So, why our kids have so many oppositions? I believe it's because they lack courage, they don't think they can do it well or even better than those international guys. We should rethink why our products, like airplane, electronic devices, medicines and so on can still have strong reputation in the world. It's because we win in the competition with other countries. This country has already made achievements for hundreds of years, from agriculture to industry, from social science to nature science. These achieved were created or are still being created by our ancestors, grandparents, parents. We believe our kids can keep making such or even bigger feat. Why right now so many of them paying so many attentions and making excuse on so-called international guys taking their opportunities rather than keeping on their study and training?\n\nI believe in contemporary, our teens are gradually losing their courage. They don't think they can do it well in STEM related jobs. They worry they cannot do it well as their international fellow guys. They worry they cannot do it well and thus employer will turn to international guys instead. This is a very unpromising sign! Remember, no matter, we make our final decision to accept STEM ext or not, whatever, we have to face the worldwide competitions! Even if we revoke this rule and thus let more of our people enter stem related jobs, we still have to face competitions around the world.\n\nHaving more STEM international guys working with our boys and girls will only have benefit, or there will be more advantage than disadvantage. I have two reasons. First, our kids can gain more experience and ability when working with guys around the world. Second, we can thus keep more international elites on this land to make contributions, rather than forcing them back with knowledge learnt here, devoting back to their countries and thus weaken us.\n\nAnyway, I still support OPT ext, which will have much more benefits rather than harms.\n\n   ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by John He", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15277", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I fully support the improvement and expansion for training opportunities for 24 months instead of 17 months.

The stability and focus, in turn, benefits numerous U.S. technology companies where these STEM students work for. Secondly, international students bring huge economic benefit to the school's local area, including shopping, service, housing and etc. Without the policy, the reduced-size of international students will become the loss of local economic opportunity and employment. Thirdly, the STEM talents coming from abroad contributes to America's success in this era of technology boom. They are hired because the companies need their talents. Some may say employees under OPT is underpaid. In common sense, as an internship period, it is very normal to be see a lower payment than full-time jobs. But, in fact, a lot of companies, such as Google, Microsoft, FB and Apple, are paying the same amount to STEM students during their OPT as a full-time. Therefore, it is never a problem of payment. It is a demand of talents. Many technology companies in other countries, such as China and India, actually offer very competitive packages to STEM students.

However, international students are not eligible to work off-campus. In their first and second years, they can only apply for on-campus jobs competing with local students in English fluency and public service experiences. Moreover, in their junior and senior years where everyone is looking for an internship or a summer program, they will find that the majority of internship or programs are only open to U.S. citizens because they are mostly funded by REU or NSF. For minority of those who do not require citizenship, they are not open to students from designated countries, which include China, Vietnam, etc. \n\n\nAfter graduation, needless to say that most interviews are not open to international students because it requires extra work and money to hire them. Even if they pass an interview luckily, they have to pick draws for a work visa with more luck. STEM international students cannot even work in the laboratories in their own schools. \n\n\nTherefore in summation of all above, I think the limitation STEM F-1 students have is so high through out their college and even higher after graduation, that they cannot fulfill and supplement their field of study as regular students.

And I just want to say something based on what I have seen since I studied in the US and worked in an engineering firm here.\n\nFirstly, international students are more talent concentrated. Regardless of majors in the university, the competition of applying to the US universities is much fiercer for international students and the extremely strict selection rules allow only those very top international students to have the opportunity to study in the US, which naturally makes them more competitive as a whole in terms of academic knowledge and professional skills.\n\nSecondly, those who can make it to an engineering firm are even one in ten mentioned above. Despite of their academic and professional talent, those international students are still at their disadvantage due to many limitations not related to educational capability. Take myself for example, I spent over 5 months applying to near 200 engineering companies in my major for a position, with less than 15 interviews and only 2 offers, while my fellow US classmates got a bunch of offers after spending a few weeks shooting less than 30 resumes. Thus, the above mentioned fact makes those who are able to start their careers in the US firms treasure the opportunity much more seriously and work much more dedicatedly.\n\nThirdly, F-1 Nonimmigrant STEM students are good GDP enhancers and tax payers, although it is almost a known secret that they earn less salaries even when they are at the same position as local employees. When does it start to become a fashion that hardworking talents should feel ashamed for earning less than their mediocre fellows doing just the same job?\n\nBut after all, talent and hardworking should not be blamed for the unemployment rate across the country. Chances are never offered out of pity, and you can never hold it in your hand when you are not capable enough, even without the competition from international students.\n\nAnd lastly, engineering has no border, but engineers have countries. Starting careers in the US does not mean that F-1 Nonimmigrant STEM students want to immigrate to the US. And improving the OPT extension will not only facilitate the economic development in the US, but also demonstrate the cultural tolerance and social equality of the US to the world to better attract more talents to contribute to this great country.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yunlin Qi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17617", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the new rule.

We are highly educated young people who legally study in the United States. Hundred and thousands of students like us come to the US and bring enormous economical benefits to this country.We literally help most of the State Universities which were suffering the budget cuts get back on track. \n\nSecondly, we are not stealing job opportunities from American citizens, which is assumed by many opponents. Most of the job opportunities prefer local students, who are so called natural-born American citizens, than F-1 students due to various of reasons like the extra cost of sponsorship etc. Many people say that those big technology companies are most likely to choose a F1 student other than an American kid simply because we are willing to accept ridiculously low wages, which is not true at all. The minimum wage provided to foreign students are restricted by the law. Those who want to apply for a H1B visa must be paid equal or even higher than the average wages of their current positions. Otherwise, they will be no longer qualified to work here after the end of the OPT. \n\nMoreover,allowing F1 Student to work is not the cause but the solution to the high unemployment rate. Extending the OPT extension is going to help the US to attract more highly- educated work force from all over the world and boost her economy. The economic slowdown will be alleviated as a result of it, which will lead to more job openings in the future. \n\nThe reason why United States is great is because it's always willing to welcome anyone with talents and dream to move to this country.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\n-There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\n-OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n \nAnd to spend more time in the U.S. as one of these proposed OPT workers has one major impact, the EPI study found: WAGE SUPPRESSION in tech-related fields.\"\n\n\nCompanies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas.\n\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is nobody's definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. The regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students.\n\nThis is not in the best interest of the legal constituents of this country bordering on unconstitutional once again and I firmly believe this proposal should be denied. The agenda is altogether too obvious and as a retired CPA and BSA, I have a very good idea of the costs associated with this OPT program. They are too high and not good for this country unless you consider this strictly from the business standpoint. Taxpayers subsidize business costs which would not be possible if a legal US citizen has that job. The business gets a cheaper resource who happily accepts the benefits from the OPT program again paid for by the tax payers of this country. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Susan Doten", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4127", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This extension benefits both nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and the U.S. technology companies, thus benefits the whole U.S.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by YU XIA", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18156", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support OPT extension for STEM F-1 visa holders.\n\nFirst, those who seek OPT are by definition:\n1) competitively selected across the globe by US education institutions, they are no doubt among the most intelligently-capable not only in the US but across the world;\n2) finished higher education, mostly post-graduate degrees in the US, which again proves their potential ability to contribute to local and global economy;\n3) highly-motivated to apply what they learn to various parts of US economy.\nLetting more of these people work in the US will only bring boosts to US economy, especially the most critically growing sectors, like information technology, biomedicine, engineering, etc.\n\nSecond, this population chose to study in the US at the first place, because of the openness and diversity of the US.

I think STEM program is beneficial to this country and all the people living here.\n\nA lot of American people are against STEM program because they think this will take away the jobs. While emotionally this is understandable, it is not necessarily true.\n\nThe STEM program is targeted for highly educated foreign students who are specified in science and technology and who have received at least a master degree from US universities. There are of course a lot of talented and highly educated US students who are equally good. In principle these two groups are in direct competition. However, you seldom hear US students complain about jobs being taken away -- not only because there are actually sufficient high tech jobs but also because they as well as their foreign classmates are not afraid of competition.\n\nIf we really start to limit the jobs for foreign students here in United States, these jobs will not necessarily stay in US anymore  think about it, these high tech companies would simply create an office in countries like India and China -- simply because there are not so many skillfully trained and highly educated people to hire (there are a lot of smart people in US but unfortunately a lot of them end up in Wall Streets). In India and China, these high tech companies can hire people for much less pay -- this doesn't sound like a good thing for US anyway. If you can keep these jobs in US and even they are partially taken by foreign students, these people need all sorts of services and eventually will create more jobs and benefit average American people.\n\nWe live in a flatten world which means people are moving around more frequently than ever. We must take action to attract more talented people to serve in US by approaches like STEM. If we dont, these jobs will simply flow away to other countries but believe me this is happening at the very moment. We shall not close our doors while other countries are trying all their effort to grab more talented people.\nWe come to United States because we love this country.

Hence they will have a better chance to become an expert in the field of they study in a much shorter time frame as compare to they do this in their own country.

I think people who oppose the improving and expanding have two main concerns. First, they believe US workers might lose the job opportunity due to compete with STEM OPT student. Well, if that is the concern, then they should SUPPORT the improving the STEM OPT program to add provisions that requires the employer to give priority to US applications given the same kind of qualification just as H1B does instead of oppose the program. Also they assumption here is that there is surplus in supply in the labor market STEM related field and there is not enough positions for US candidate. But the reality is US employer is short of STEM related engineers and scientist in large quantity. Is that the reason why we encourage more kids to study STEM schools and universities in the first place?  Second, they argues that the hire of the STEM OPT students will lower US works wages. This kind of believe shows a lack of basic understanding a free market. Base on this kind of reasoning, probably we should not allowed any immigrant to this country as well.

Most of the international students who need OPT STEM extension receive the highest education in the US, and they are seeking opportunities like engineers and scientists. Is US having too many engineers and scientists in the US? No!!! US has too few of them. China, India, Russia and Brazil are spending a huge amount of money to attract the best scientists and engineers to go to their countries; and US, are thinking of expelling them because they are seizing job opportunities of local workers? How many local workers are qualified for the top-level scientists and engineers positions that require years of master or even doctoral level training? I don't know the exact number, but I believe 0.01% might be an over-estimate.\n\nBesides,the OPT STEM extension opportunity will create more job opportunities for local people. Many of the international students are seeking for scientists and engineering positions, and they need the opportunity to gain working experience in the US. But mostly they are not going to always stay in these companies. They want to start their own business in the US, and hire local people. No one doubts that the United States is the best place to start business, and now is the best time, than ever. Many of most impactful and successful companies are originally start-up companies, and many of them are started by international students. Such as Nvidia, the largest manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the world. It is founded by a Taiwanese, named Jen-Hsun Huang. If he did not have the opportunity to work in the US, there would be no Nvidia, thus no general purpose GPU, no advancement in deep learning - a revolutionary achievement in artificial intelligence, no modern video games with lavish visual effects but still running smoothly on your laptop, and our supercomputers would be hundreds of thousand times slower than what we actually have now. And, this is just on single instance, from the tens of thousands (even more) similar cases.\n\nIn summary, we should definitely support the improving and expanding of the training opportunities of international students. It is about the destiny of the country - the United States.  Do not be short-sighted and allured by some dangerous immediate \"benefit\". If you really care about the future of the country, care about the future of your children, you should support the OPT STEM extension. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jason Cooper", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21841", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I highly support for this proposal.\nIt is a remarkable idea to give an 24 month extension.\n\nFirst, it will increase the strength of US and benefits general people who live in US.\nThe salary of H1B holders are much more than American's average salary.

With the help of new extension, we don't have to worry about a early termination of our academic projects and keep going. These positions usually require high educated students but payment is less. These students would like to keep working for academic area rather than working in industry. They fall in love with science and academic field. With help of these people, science and technology of America will get progress quickly. American did that before and became most powerful country in the world. Now America need more talented people like that since STEM fields are more complicated than before. Getting a good result needs more people to work together. Thus, the extension should be much more important than that before.  \nAccording my person experience, the last four researches related to computer science are three years or fours years.

I hold that improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students is very beneficial to the continuing prosperity of the country. It also helps US keep dominating cutting-edge technologies. There are three major reasons.\n\nFirstly, nonimmigrant students form a large portion of outstanding students in graduate schools nationwide. Take my research group as an example, 80% of the PhD students came from countries outside the US and they are playing critical roles in major projects funded by US organizations such as NSF. I would say loosing them is a huge loss to the country. If the current proposal is approved, they will have many more contributions to the research society of the US even after graduation. \n\nSecondly, diversity is the core reason why the US is competitive globally. This country has been attracting talents from all the countries in the world and many of them are now playing important roles in major companies or even government agencies. We can view the major companies and government agencies as important building blocks of the country. In the long run, giving more opportunities for nonimmigrant students who are well educated is the best solution to keep the building blocks running in a virtuous cycle.\n\nThirdly, a large amount of F-1 nonimmigrant students like me is holding/held scholarships, which mainly come from the universities or external companies. The money, after all, comes from donators or taxpayers. We deeply appreciate being financially supported by all these nice people in this country, and we would like to make our best contributions to the country as well as its citizens in return. From the perspective of the country, letting these students further contribute to this country rather than loosing them is perhaps the best strategy to encourage donators and taxpayers in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, improving and expanding training opportunities to well-educated F-1 nonimmigrant students would only be beneficial to the country. It will have positive impacts on the research society, diversity and the whole economy. I hereby request serious consideration of passing this proposal. Thank you for spending time reading my comment.\n\nRegards,\nLinguang\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Linguang Zhang, Princeton University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9406", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n\n1.

Further restriction such as cancelling OPT extension will only damage the competitiveness of US enterprises. \n\n2.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for re instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\n \n\nThe proposal to re institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\n \n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\n Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\n \n\nEstablishing goals and a professional road map at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\n \n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\n \n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\n \nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule making. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n    There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers: the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n    \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO: \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n    \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans.

It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n    \"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n    \"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n    \"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by William Whited", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3809", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As an international student in analytical chemistry, I strongly hope this 24 months STEM OPT extension can be approved.

This proposal does not help the United States or the workers of the United States\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. \n\nSenator Charles Grassley has said that the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\nAttorney John Miano has said that the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis believes that on a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO has said that \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\nMr. Trumpka continues \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\nTrumpka believes that \"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\nIan Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute concludes \"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.\"\n\"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\n\nDHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n\n\"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\"\n\"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\nI have only included only a few of the arguments against this proposed program. The arguments against this proposal are numerous and strong. This proposal does not help the United States or the workers of the United States. I propose that we give incentives to companies and colleges to train American students and workers to fill any void in these and all other workplace  fields.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Janelle Furstinger", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3194", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I STRONGLY support the rule of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all Eligible F-1 students.\n\nFirstly, STEM students are making a great contribution to the economics of US. STEM students work in the fields such as IT, engineering, banking, which constitute the majority of the economics of the whole nation. US needs a large amount of high-quality STEM students to continuously take part in and expand in these fields, in order to support and improve the economics. On the contrary, the shortage of potential employees in such fields will directly jeopardize the foundation of affected fields. What's worse, sooner or later, the economics of the whole nation is compromised and becomes incredibly difficult, if not totally impossible, to undo the severe consequence.\n\nSecondly, in today's world economics, it is unwise to enforce any protectionism in order to achieve some short-term or unreliable benefits. Human resources are the most valuable to any economic entity, which has been a common view of most countries in the world. US has endeavored for more than one hundred years to build up its own reputation of being an open and free country, where human rights and ideas are highly valued. \"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.\" In today's more and more connected world, five minutes are just a too-long period. US needs to be able to keep as many high-tech working labors as possible, rather than to send them away to other entities which are more than willing to receive.\n\nTo sum up, I believe the proposed rule to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students should be favored, considering the high-tech industries STEM students will work in have critical impacts on the nation's economics and US can also face the competition of other economic entities where human resources are equally or even more valued.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Robert Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19636", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the OPT program.

Now I am working at a startup company as a software engineer in San Francisco with my OPT. Honestly, I was really worried when I saw the news that the original 17-month opt extension was revoked this August. Lots of my friends were also very upset. We are foreign students came from different countries. We came to U.S. to pursue BS/MS/PhD degree for better education here. But if opt extension is revoked, so many young and talented students have to go back to their original countries, say goodbye to the career they just started, which is very unreasonable, also a bad news for those U.S. employers, such as those tech companies. They would also lose great employees, which is the most resource for a company. But now, if we can make this good news - the new proposed rule valid, it will bring so many benefits, which is really really exciting. At least for myself, if this rule is confirmed eventually, I would have 3 times to attend the H1B visa lottery; I won't need to worry about my visa anymore, I can finally focus on my work and life with relief.\n\nAlso, this proposal will definitely improve the integrity of the STEM OPT program by encouraging we students to gain valuable, practical STEM experience, while preventing adverse effects to U.S. workers. By enhancing our functional understanding of how to apply academic knowledge in a work setting, we will be better qualified to embark on careers in their respective fields of study. These on-the-job experiences would be obtainable only with employers committed to developing students knowledge and skills through practical application. Moreover, the proposed rules aim to maintain the competitive edge in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States, which is so important to the U.S.\n\nIn summary, I totally support this proposal and hope it could be valid as soon as possible.

There are insufficient number of American citizens/permanent residents who are willing to take these occupations. 2. The F1 nonimmigrant STEM students, through their efforts, have brought their employers lots of interests, vitality and growing potential, which is beneficial to themselves, and more importantly, to the U.S. economy. Many of the non-immigrant students came to the U.S. self-supported, which helps colleges gain funding for building facilities and conduct research. After graduation, they continue to be one of the largest group of consumers, spend lots of money on travelling, purchasing electronics, luxury products, vehicles and even real estates. The amount of money each of them spend is probably enough to create several, or even more working opportunities. Besides, as the F1 nonimmigrant students come from all over the world, they bring their customs, lifestyle, art and other cultural beliefs into the U.S., nourishing this country's own culture.\n\nTherefore, I would by all means recommend the U.S. government to give more opportunities to these young people and let them help build a more prosperous and progressive American society.

It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\"\n\nI am an unemployed engineer. Additional foreign STEM workers are NOT needed in the United States. There are multitudes    of unemployed STEM workers in the United States available for employment. There is no shortage of STEM workers in the United States. This rule would adversely affect United States citizens seeking STEM employment by creating an economic incentive for US employers seeking STEM workers to preferentially hire foreign STEM graduates over the existing available pool of qualified STEM workers.

I have been in the US for 6 and a half years, I have so many friends from various countries all around the world, China, India, Iran, Sweden, Russia, Japan, Korea, etc, who got their BS MS or PhD degrees from the US colleges, then work in the US high-tech industry. I have to say that my friends and their employer all have benefited a lot from the STEM extension.\n\n1. I start with students. As international students studying STEM majors, working is as important as education in the career life for STEM major students because working trains the students how to apply the knowledge learned in class to practical problems in the industry. Therefore, we came to the US, who has the most advanced college education and the best policies to support international students with a legal status to work in the best environment for High-tech industry. STEM extension plays a most important role in this process. US government only issues a limited number of working visa to new international graduates, so without STEM extension most of the international students needs to go back to their home country without any training in the industry. Such students are not competitive in their home countries job market. An example is the salary survey from China, the average salary of new graduates with foreign degrees but not industrial experience is actually lower than the students with the same level of domestic degrees with or without working experience. So it is fair that after devoting a large amount of money and time in the US, the International student can get a chance to better train themselves in the industry even if they are not issued a working visa before they return to their home country.\n\n2. As for the employers, the benefit is even larger. Normally an industrial project will last for more than 1 year. If the employee who works on this project leaves it is very hard for others to pick it up. I have done one such project with Huawei Research American in 2012. One of the senior employee left in the middle of the project, causing the entire project to pend for several months. This causes huge time and human resources to be wasted on both side. One of my friends works under STEM extension in Marvel(micro chip industry) for more than two years. During that time he only works on one single project. If he left in the middle, the company needs one new employee to pick up his work, this needs time, HR, financial resources, to hire a new employee and to re-plan the entire project. I don't think any employer wants to see this happen. \n\nHopefully the new stem extension can be approved.

Someone like me who has a PhD and Masters degree from US, having spent more than 5 years here is not exempted from social security.\n\nSecond, it is just plain rhetoric that foreign students a majority of whom get a graduate degree are paid lower than a citizen. For one, it costs ~$5000 for an employer to sponsor a H1B to a foreign student. Second, there is a 70% chance of not getting picked up for H1B visa in lottery (2015 numbers). With such odds against foreign students why in world would an employer go for foreign students over equally qualified American employees? Unless there is a real skill shortage in specific STEM areas foreign students are never preferred over citizens. It's time such generalizations are stuck down by facts.\n\nThird, the zero sum argument being put up here. Immigrants are taking jobs away from Americans! American jobs for Americans! Kauffman foundation study by a Stanford based researcher states 44% of Silicon Valley startups were created by immigrants. Please ship these jobs along with the founders back to their country of origin to be fair. Please send back jobs created by SpaceX, PayPal, Tesla Motors to South Africa. Elon Musk came here to get a degree at UPenn. How many net jobs did he steal? Please send half of Google jobs to Russia since Sergey Brin was born there. Some other surprising examples of immigrant founded companies are Intel (Andy Grove), Sun Microsystems, Huffington Post, eBay and Yahoo!! Would US be better of without these amazing companies? \n\nIt is time the sane and logical voices among American public and polity make themselves heard. If not all you will hear is the vocal xenophobic minority shouting Foreigners out! The only reason many immigrants including students from top universities stay back is the economic freedom here and availability of top talent (including best minds from around the world). But the moment the visa burden reaches it's tipping point these top minds will go back to their country, though unwittingly. \n\nThe world is multi-polar. It wouldn't take much for the xenophobes in US to push out these top innovators, trained and paid by US taxpayers to China, India, Russia or Brazil on a platter.

We are providing the best higher education to the best of the best students all over the world. It does not make any sense if we just let them leave the US, return to their original country, and contribute with all they've learned in the US.  A large part of the most successful figures in science and industry in the US are originally international students. They received higest education, and then start to contribute to this country, using the OPT and OPT STEM extension opportunities. Without these wonderful opportunities, they would have returned to their own country, start their business, lead their research, serve for their military forces, and help their own country to surpass the US.\n\nSome people hold the narrow and one-sided opinion that international students are seizing the job opportunities of US native workers. This is very short-sighted. Most of the international students who need OPT STEM extension receive the highest education in the US, and they are seeking opportunities like engineers and scientists. Are we having too many engineers and scientists in the US? No!!! We have too few of them. China, India, Brazil and Russia are spending a huge amount of money to attrack the best scientists and engineers to go to their countries; and we, the US, are thinking of expelling them because they are seizing job opportunities of local workers? How many of our local workers are qualified for the top-level scientists and engineers positions that require years of master or even doctoral level training? \n\nBesides, we strongly believe that the OPT STEM extension opportunity will create more job opportunities for our local people. Many of my international student friends tells me that they are planning to start their own business in the US, which will create job opportunities for local people. They all believe that the United States is the best place to start your business, and now is the best time, than ever. Many of our most impactful and successful companies are originally start-up companies, and many of them are started by international students. Do you know Nvidia, the largest manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the world? It is founded by a Taiwanese, named Jen-Hsun Huang. If he did not have the opportunity to work in the US, there would be no Nvidia, thus no general purpose GPU, no advancement in deep learning - a revolutionary achievement in artificial intelligence, no modern video games with lavish visual effects but still running smoothly on your laptop, and our supercomputers would be hundreds of thousand times slower than what we actually have now. And, this is just on single instance, from the tens of thousands (even more) similar cases.\n\nIn summmary, we should definitely support the improving and expanding of the training opportunities of international students. It is about the destiny of the country that we all love - the United States. Let's do not be short-sighted and allured by some dangerous immediate \"benefit\". If you really care about the future of our country, care about the future of your children, you should support the OPT STEM extension.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ming Zhao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12034", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "US and US citizens will definately benefit from brilliant young hardworking individuals.

I think it will help create more jobs in the long run. I also believe that it DHS should add additional checks to ensure that its programs are not misused.\n\nMy first recommendation is that DHS should consider making the extension applicable to students from Accredited and Public/Non-Profit colleges.  So that it does not create wrong incentives for profit oriented schools to recruit more students by promoting their educational programs as employment programs. DHS should consider using the same list of college as the H1-B advanced degree quota.\n\nMy second concern is about efficiency of mentoring program in a consulting situation. The proposed employer mentoring and training program may not be work in a consulting type work arrangement where the hired OPT student does not works directly with the employer but is working for a client in a remote location. DHS should include how the mentoring program will work in such situations.\n\nThirdly, I believe that DHS should make the proposed checks applicable to all OPTs. The proposed checks and safeguards should also apply to the first 12 months of OPT and OPTs issues in college to maintain continuity. The mentoring and training program should apply to all STEM OPT programs.\n\nLastly, the assumptions used to assess the impact on current employment in \"Regulatory Impact Analysis OPT STEM - October 2015\" document are not complete. The impact of the OPT extension cannot be looked at it by itself. It should also include the impact of all prior OPTs issued to the student including OPTs issued when in college. The more students US attracts because of the proposed extension, will also result in higher OPTs issued for the first 12 months and also OPTs issued in college. I strongly believe that with the right assumptions, the percentage of STEM OPT students in STEM employment population will be significantly more than 0.19 percent.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2359", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The thought that additional foreign workers will be brought to this country to compete for jobs that could be done by American workers and WITHOUT paying payroll taxes is unconscionable!

Most cities and countries accepting  migrants reasonably has the highest development.  As we all know, New York, Shanghai and other financial center cities in the world has the most migrants. Why is that? Because when a city decides to welcome the people from outside, it is embracing the best chance to improve itself. So is the states. When DHS decides to extend the OPT for foreign talent students, it gives U.S. a best chance to enhance its technology, culture, society in all aspects.In contrast, whoever has the most anti-foreign sentiment will go down step by step. At this point, I have to mention Hongkong, the past most flourishing city in China before its anti-mainland sentiment destroyed its prosperity. In the past year, it is the most controversial year for Hongkong to release its local people emotion to  drive the mainland people out. However, most local business was relying on the mainland people. When the anti actions of local people are on the way against exchange students, workers, and tourists from other parts of China, and fulfilling the press, their business is like mountains falling down. There are a lot of other history lessons like this. So, it is no doubt that welcoming people from outside is a wisdom movement to improve local economy, not to mention, the foreign students can survive in U.S. are probably elites in the world. Shorten their OPT time or driving them out of States is probably a least considerable idea for U.S., which may be a shortsighted or selfish opinion from a small group of U.S. citizens. \n\n2. The answer is no if there is a question about whether the F-1 students are occupying more and more limited jobs for U.S citizen. We are knowing that the 20s are most intelligent people who have the most creative mind among all of those ages, who are also the most part of F-1 students. If you allow them work in U.S. in their most creative lifetime, you are not reducing the job opportunities but creating more. This whole world needs innovations, and the U.S. needs most when it is now at the top countries list of creations. Satya Nadella, who was born and finished the college in India, but the CEO of Microsoft now, who is definitely creating more jobs for U.S citizen. There are a lot of infamous U.S. entrepreneurs who was born and got the bachelors or masters even phD in U.S. and utilized their creative mind to create more jobs for U.S. citizens. Besides, the OPT required the F-1 Students only to do the jobs which are in the e-verify lists. Most e-verify positions certainly prefer the U.S. citizens rather than F-1 students. This means if the F-1 students got the position, the hire company probably has found out he/she with the special skill is a better-fit for this jobs, which may not be a U.S. citizen enjoyed job. Then, it is not hurting any citizen benefits. I certainly believe none of F-1 students will go to local grocery store for asking a low-technical job when he/she is during OPT. The local grocery store preferred a U.S. citizen, and  the F-1 students also preferrs a high-technical job so that he/she will have a better job experience when they come back to home country for living. There is not a very good-standing point to let a group of high intelligent students back to their home country as soon as possible when you have the choice to keep their intelligence servicing the United States. \n\nOverall, this is a wise program for DHS to make, and a wise decision for U.S. citizen to realize for prospering States and keeping it always young and free.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yesen Zhou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17192", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Kindly implement new proposed rule.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nRichard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n\n\"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Albert Reichenbach", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4089", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "See attached file(s)", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sujeeth Parthiban", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2923", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This extension will be a great thing and i strongly support it. this will help students to gain good practical experience.

The government spends so much money on these students to provide FREE!!!! education to them!!!! It's INSANE to send them back immediately after they enjoy the FREE education. These international students should be given longer time to make contribution to this country!!!\n\n(2) This country shouldn't close the door just because people are scared of BENIGN competitions. \nThe bar for international students to apply jobs is extremely high. The priorities will always give to US citizens. The international students need to put much much more effort to get jobs. It's not international students bringing the competition to US job markets. The people who cannot find jobs, please blame yourself, nobody can always eat free lunch! \nAnd also, these international students are not the people who get extremely low salaries and just want to stay in US. The students using STEM OPT-extension are talent people who can always get very high salary everywhere in the world. There is no reason for them to live here poorly! \nNOBODY STEAL JOBS FROM US citizens!! NO UNFAIR competition here! \n \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joanne Lee", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11125", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": " I believe OPT-extension is NECESSARY for our country.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\nA. \n\n Why IS this rule open to ONLY foreign persons without reasonable standards indicating ability to succeed at a US school. The regulation does not seek qualified students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the US as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nOPT is a form of \"temporary\" employment lasting 48 months, which exceeds any reasonable definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, the OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists a foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program exclusively for foreign students.\n\n\n\nD. \n\nThe Regulation doesn't require a student to be taught anything. The Regulation leaves it to UNTRAINED employers to incorporate a formal mentoring & training program for STEM OPT students. The employer is a business not a educator.\n\nNote:  The Regulation does not indicate any scarcity of US resident scholars or STEM students.\n\nThe Regulation has no plan requiring a employer to provide proof it is not replacing US workers with foreign students. The ambiguous language is unreasonable & unfair.\n\nThe Regulation failed to mention the most obvious documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers are the employers payroll and personal records. What an employer is paying his current employees is directly relevant evidence of how and what the employer values competent work. Instead, the Regulations allows the employer to hide the documents that it actually relies on and use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys, to set compensation for their U.S. workers. In short, the Regulations allow the employer and DHS to ignore reality (I.e. what is actually happening) ad substitute fantasy (i.e.what the employer and DHS hope is happening.)\n\nThe Regulations describe employers hiring high skilled STEM OPT students, unreasonably assuming foreign students are highly skilled, despite the Regulations citing the need for this regulation to 1) EDUCATE un-educated foreign students & 2) provide experience to un-experienced foreign students.\n\nThe Regulations do not restrict a definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business. .\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose any penalty for employer violations of the Regulations. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regulation, and thus the Statute, without penalty. \n\n\n\n\n                \n \n\n  \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gregory Williamson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4756", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The goal of STEM extension in OPT program is to keep the U.S. competitive in science and technology field. And I believe by extending to 24-month length, it will better serve this goal.\n\nCanceling the STEM extension will have direct impact on current OPT employees and discourage talented students coming to American to study, While extending it to 24-month would bring more benefits in following aspects\n\nThough my college education here in the U.S. I worked for two companies -- Tesla Motors in San Francisco  and Continental Automotive in Chicago. During my time at Tesla Motors, the most advanced electric vehicle company on earth, I strongly felt what makes Tesla a leader in the industry is exactly what makes America a leader in science and technology globally. America has been absorbing the best of the best talents across the world and provide an open environment for research and invention. In Tesla Motors, I met talents from Germany, UK, Canada, China, Turkey, India, Korea, and so on. They are all contributing to this great company. Tesla Motors identifies these talents and try all means to get them as soon as possible. This hiring strategy enables Tesla to innovate and develop product in a faster pace than industry average. Looking at bigger pictures in Silicon Valley, companies are getting top talents around the world which makes Silicon Valley the center for technology innovation in the world. By extending to 24-month program, more talents will be attracted by the openness and opportunity in the U.S. \n\nSecond, 24-month extension is beneficial because it follows the natural timeline of an engineering product development cycle. As DHS mentioned, students should participate in meaningful projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of their field of study. In the automotive industry, product development has to reflect more engineering concerns than other industries. For example, the electronic control unit I worked with usually takes 2-3 years to develop from scratch. During this 2-3 years, engineers have to go through many rigorous tests. A brand new car, such as Tesla Model S or Model X, took 2-3 years to build from initial ideas to design, testing, manufacturing and eventually pushing to market. it is even longer in traditional automotive giants like FORD, GM, Chrysler to develop a brand new car, which is around 3-5 years. While I was doing internship with Tesla, I delivered my 4-month project on the last day of my internship. Though my colleagues can refer to the technical documents I left, it will be much more productive and responsive if they could just communicate with me on any problems with my projects. For full-timer OPT employers, more important and more difficult projects should be assigned to them, I could imagine how inconvenient it will be if someone just leave in the middle of the projects. 12 month plus 24-month extension will allow a decent time to deliver a project, as well as to hand over the project to other colleagues. Moreover, going through a complete design cycle will definitely sharpen students' professional skills and make them more competitive in the coming careers.\n\nThe third reason is that now we are doing business in a global market. As a company, you need to have diversities and international background in the workforce to better expand globally. As a employer, you need to know people from other countries and truly understand the culture in order to be better prepared for the challenges at work. I will still use myself as an example. At the end of my internship at Tesla Motors I was sent to Shanghai, China to support MODEL S delivery in China because of my unique background. I can understand the engineering and manufacturing of the car as well as communicate with customers in mother tongue. Obviously companies need people that are well-trained in their field of study and able to work in a global context. If company like Tesla expands globally, its increasing demands will create more jobs in their factory as well as all the suppliers in Tesla's supply chain for the locals. So not only extended OPT will not take jobs away from the U.S citizens, it will help companies to grow such that they can create more jobs. \n\nThe last point, following from last paragraph, OPT students are really not competing unfairly with locals. First of all the employee has to be e-verify. E-verify prevents unlawful discriminatory practices based on national or citizenship status. And second, school will not allow extension if the jobs are not related to the field of study of the students, which limits the type of jobs students can apply. At the same time, it rises the bar for international graduates who wants to get OPT approved because the requirements will make sure they are qualified for these jobs. And these jobs are just a small fraction of overall domestic job market.\n\nIn summary, I think 24-month is a reasonable time-length for after-graduation training for STEM students.\n\n\n  ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zitao Liao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17393", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is another political bone headed idea which will further destroy the ability for American STEM workers to find a job.

Indeed, there are Americans in the STEM fields who are unemployed, possibly because of this unfiair program. Foriegn graduates can find mentoring in their own countries. Send them home and let them do so.\n\n   The OPT was not, is not and will never be unfair discrimination against American citizens who are competing in the workplace as STEM graduates. \n  \n  This comment just gives us two facts: one is the OPT and the other is the unemployment of some Americans in the STEM fields. It doesnt give us how serious the unemployment is? Is it serious enough to be considered as a social problem? (As we all know, there are always jobless people for some reason.)  More importantly, the comment just guesses the former possibly being the cause of the latter. However, it gives no proof.\n\n  People who are unemployed mostly caused by their own flaws. For example, they are reluctant to spend required time and energy on their tasks. They have two-star abilities with five-star ambitions. Employers will not hire them even without international students as competitors. As for those who are really diligent and talented American graduate students,  the reason of being unemployed is probably that the career path itself is hard. For example,  people learning bioscience is extremely hard to get a related job. (Meanwhile, people majoring in Computer Science and Finance can easily find a job). It is the supply and demand that counts rather than the competition of others. Moreover, there are rules protecting American citizens rights of working. International students can choose limited kind of jobs. For example, I am graduate student in The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University. I attended job affairs this year. I learnt that NASA wont take international students. GE only has one section taking international students Thus, we cant conclude that international students take American students jobs away. Furthermore, as international student who are successfully accepted by universities in USA must be talented. They are very likely to start their own business in the future and thus create more job opportunities for citizens. \n\n\nSecond, I will show the necessity, importance and benefits to endorse the new rule.   \n\n  1, Now is the era of collaboration. USA must cooperate with the world to flourish. \n     For example, China is raising and thus has lots of opportunities for American companies. It is an advantage to Chinese in the company, for the following reasons: \n      1) Chinese has its own business culture (such as making deals when having meal).  Thus, Chinese employees tend to make the deal done faster and better than the Americans. Moreover, just seeing a familiar face in the same county makes people feel familiar and friendly. It is an advantage when doing business.\n      2) Chinese are born and raised in China, so they know what Chinese want, i.e. know the market. They will come up with more suitable business plan.\n     3)  When the employees went back to China, whether starting their own company or working in a new one, they are connection for  their former American employers in China. Those students are educated and trained in USA. Therefore they have attachment for USA, i.e they have a high possibility of giving special treats to USA.\n\n2. When those students go back to their home country, they may provide better servise for America . They learn American culture and their need during working here. If they start any company, it has higher chance to serve USA better than the ones who dont have the experience.\n\n3. We know the ratio of international students in STEM is very high. For example, our department has 9 international students out of the 18. It is a official recognition for the intelligence and diligence of international students. Letting these talented young people join the workforce of America will definitely promote the further development of America. Especially, STEM is most important areas that serves the society. The cutting-eage tech will make American life easier and better. Moreover, if they finally stay and become citizens. They are high-educated and they tend to let their kid been educated well. Thus, their offsprings will also be good workforce for America.\n\n\n(My comment is too long, so I break into two.

The negative feelings some expressed on this site root in their bias and misconception that confining domestic competition can solve the problem or dissatisfaction they have with the job market. The job market has been globalized for a long time. It might be true that in the STEM area or particularly IT industry, citizens are feeling growing pressure from international students, but one has to acknowledge that these booming industries, e.g., IT, which has been one of the driving forces of the US economy after the recession, must give their thanks to the diligent working ethic and innovative spirit of foreign graduates/workers who work legally in the US. The stimulation they created for the economy as a whole largely outweighs the downside that citizens are facing more competition. More job opportunities are created for citizens because of the effort of the nonimmigrant students. The narrow-minded notion that by confining local job market competition will gain any benefit can only harm the US as a whole, undermining its creativity, and competitive edge over other fast-growing countries and regions. If one thinks those effects maybe indirect, then a direct effect one will see soon if the STEM extension is cancelled would be in the education sector. International students have become a major source of revenue for schools as well as local government. A degree acquired without practicing/working experience will significantly diminish the value of the education foreign students can expect, and accordingly, their willingness to come. That can only harm the economy as a whole and weaken the competitiveness of the US in the global job market.

How many employers would spend such valuable time and money training on an employee who can only work for 1 or 2 years. Most of OPT students who wants to work after OPT visa have to apply for H1B, which require a minimum wage for the applicants. The minimum wage for foreign workers are usually higher than the average wages  on the market (please refer to http://www.flcdatacenter.com/). Actually, employers surely want to hire American worker if there is enough qualified candidates.\nHighly skilled foreign students are elites from all over the world. OPT program are their start point to realize the American dream, more importantly, it's the first door open to thousands of American companies that looking for competitive employees in nowadays high-tech era.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Henry Oliver", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16532", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's time We stopped this and all Government Overreach, Here and forever.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nToo often American workers are literally dumpted by their employers in favor of cheaper and captive foreign workers who are essentially slaves to their emplyers if they wish to stay in the US.  The Disney workers situation exemplifies this perfectly where the employees had to train foreign workers to do their jobs before the Americans were let go.\n\nThe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.  The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"  The US has a big problem because they don't or won't track visas of all types issued to foreigners to visit the US.  It was because the US doesn't track student visas that led to the 9/11/01 attack against the US.\n\nI strongly object to the expansion of Optional Practical Training.

Without existence of OPT, these people would not have made the huge contribution and impact to US tech industry, instead they would have come back to their own countries and started tech companies in their own countries using what they learnt from US graduate schools, which in turn become competitors with US companies. In addition to these big names, there are hundreds of thousands of international students in STEM majors that become important workforce for US companies.\n\nTake a glance on a larger scale. According to wikipedia, 27 out the 87 (more than 30%) American Nobel Prize winners in Medicine and Physiology between 1901 and 2005 were born outside the US, many of whom obtained PhD degrees from universities in US. According to a NY Times article in 2011, \"The number of international scholars working at colleges and universities in the United States  as researchers, instructors and professors  rose to 115,000 last year, an all-time high, from 86,000 in 2001.\" And this number continues to grow since then.

America is a great country and the leader of world because it has always been attracting talents all over the world. I don't think I need to list all the names of great people who're immigrants or children of immigrants. They have always been contributing to this country.\nI support STEM OPT extension for there following reasons.\nFirstly, international students on OPT don't lower the minimum wage. They are not cheap labor. Most STEM students work in science and technology, and they are paid much higher than minimum wage. And THEY PAY TAXES. Students on OPT or H1B visa often pay more than 30% of their salary to the federal and the state. They actually contribute to the social welfare and public services.\nSecondly, they contribute to more powerful american companies, which bring more jobs. Tech companies need more qualified tech workers than what american citizens could provide. This could cause they to fail in competition with companies outside the country. With employing qualified international students, they could grow faster and stronger, and create more jobs for american  citizens too. Just check how many immigrants work in Google, Facebook, Uber, etc. They are one of the reasons why the tech industry of the U.S is on the top of the world.\nThirdly, American academic institutes need international students, and they need OPT extension to attract international students. International students could help american academic sectors remain competitive globally. The U.S is not the only country with good high education. The U.K, Canada, Germany, Australia, etc,  have prestigious universities as well. And many of them are comping up with policies to attract international students. They know these highly educated students could contribute much to their countries. If we drive international students away after they finish their education here, I wonder how many international students will consider coming to the U.S at all. Besides paying tuitions to the institutes, international students all contribute to local economy on many aspects apparently. \nI strongly support this policy and hope it could be passed as soon as possible.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Brian Lockhart", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14288", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I completely second this coment-\n\"Dear DHS,\n\nPlease do a through investigation about what I am going to write here. I have nothing against OPT/H1B visas but DHS should check the misuse of OPT visas and H1B visas done by the consultancies/employers.\n\nMassive visa fraud is happening in the broad day light done by Indian consultancies. These so called Indian employers fake their resume and select candidates who are in OPT claiming that they have H1B visa. They run fake pay rolls and hire mostly Indian grads from US universities who can't even speak proper English. These so called consultancies get projects from companies(subcontracted by them) by showing that they have a very strong experienced workforce with 5-10 years experience. Most of the interviews with contractors are done through Skype and questions are answered by an experienced guy who will be on loudspeaker during the interview. While the actual candidate will lip sync to proxy candidate's reply to interviewers questions. Companies have hired thousands of fake candidates like this and some of them got fired. Consultancies/employers will lose that job contract as a result of this. But they will continue doing this as a candidate with US degree is their cash cow. These companies won't do background check properly and a person with a fake profile joins them. Within a span of 1 month they will be caught and kicked out. Some lucky ones stay there with the help of skilled proxies. These fake candidates will share their laptop screens with proxy worker sitting in India and get this work done. There are lots of fraudulent practices happening without the notice of officials and the industry.\n\nRecent examples are raids conducted by DHS on couple of Indan IT consultancy firms based in California and New Jersey. They arrested some Indian entrepreneurs who ran fake pay roll and employed candidates with fake experience. If you check the number of H1B visa applications you will realize the shocking number of applications that were duplicated by these con men. \n\nWithin a year, the H1B applications will overflow to 300,000 numbers because most of these consultancies will put 3-4 applications to get their H1B selected. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and other companies that apply for more than thousands of H1 visa applications should be investigated as such companies employ less than 30 percent American citizens. \n\nAs an American citizen, I am fed up of these consultancies and fake candidates. Because of their fraudulent activities many companies don't trust Indian graduates. It's become a stereotype that an Indian students always cheats in exams, fakes their resume and get jobs which should be given to genuinely experienced candidates.\n\nThis brain drain concept is completely ridiculous. I don't believe that USA as a great country needs foreign graduates to save economy or future of this country. Most of the foreign students especially Indian and chinese are here to make money and they don't come here to create jobs or create intelligent kids to save United States. It's a shame that United States as a great country can't control such frauds from taking advantage of this system. Please do a thorough investigation on such people and make OPT rules strict to prevent such malpractices by consultancies. \n\nIt is also important to save American jobs for American people. I would like to recommend that any employer should call foreign graduates only after they have interviewed a specific number of American candidates to make sure that the priority is given to American citizens. Please do the needful to stop these fraud Indian consultancies. Rather than giving OPT visas to all students who graduate here in USA, you should implement a system where students with good academic credentials directly benefit from system. Those who fake their credentials should be punished by cancelling the OPT and deporting them back to where they came from. \n\nPlease strictly enforce OPT visa holders to work in their corresponding fields they have their degrees based on. Recently, I have noticed that many of the mechanical engineering grads started working with these IT consultancies with fake profile and fake experience. Please take necessary steps to avoid such issues in future. Please stop them from changing companies during the OPT period. This will make sure that those who fake resumes to join a company will pay the price eventually. Stop graduates working with fake experience and taking away American jobs!! \n\nTo avoid faking resumes and profiles by these con artists, I hereby request DHS to enforce background check rules on these candidates before they even start their jobs. If you don't take care of concerns raised by American workers like me eventually this rule will be thrown out by another judge in the court. So I hope you'll address my concerns to implement a strong rule to avoid such fraudulent activities by foreign graduates and Indian consultancies. \"\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2061", "postedDate": "2015-10-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Agree.

Many of my friends, who are against this policy hold point of view that F-1 students' entering into job market may cause unemployment rate of US citizen go higher. Being curious on whether it is really the case, I did some research:\nhttp://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm \naccording to this link, statistically, more than 76.2% unemployed people hold a high school degree of lower level of education, while considering international students this policy applies to, all of them have a master degree or higher to enter a job market. Obviously, these two group of people hardly overlap or compete with each other in job searching. \nTalking about total number of OPT students in STEM, compare with total number of US unemployed citizen, it's too small a portion. While by driving these students away from the states, US is facing a bigger challenge of getting labors in STEM filed.\n\"In many of these countries, the predicted shortfall of STEM (short for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workers is supposed to number in the hundreds of thousands or even the millions. A 2012 report by President Obamas Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, for instance, stated that over the next decade, 1 million additional STEM graduates will be needed. In the U.K., the Royal Academy of Engineering reported last year that the nation will have to graduate 100 000 STEM majors every year until 2020 just to stay even with demand. Germany, meanwhile, is said to have a shortage of about 210 000 workers in whats known there as the MINT disciplinesmathematics, computer science, natural sciences, and technology.\" This comment is from webpage http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth. Another thing I found is, I have been teaching undergraduate students Physics in one of University of California for roughly two years, and chatting with them surprise me, that even very hard working students hesitate to proceed to STEM related filed for master degree, not talking about PHD. \nHowever, given the situation US is short of STEM students, a big portion of these OPT students will not work for long in the states. The reason is obvious, working abroad in STEM is both intellectually and mentally challenging. Only those who are functioning as irreplaceable experts in certain fields, rather than cheap labors can stay for long, which in the long run, benefit growth of economy and development of fundamental research. In which case, will be even a tiny portion.\nLastly, imaging if US have a policy less welcome students from top universities abroad, a big portion of them will be attracted to other developed countries like Canada, Australia. Being lack of international students contributing in education and services in US universities, US universities will be facing with problems of lack of diversity. However, diversity is playing a crucial role to STEM areas.   \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mengyao Shi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18726", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am in complete agreement to this newly proposed rule to have STEM OPT extension of 24 months.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\n \nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.Cap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nSiddhartha Yavvari\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Siddhartha  Yavvari", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4435", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree to this extension of OPT.

I believe the OPT extension policy with 2 more years will be very helpful to utilize my knowledge and contribute to the fast growth of my company. 1 year is too short for most students to really contribute to the growth of their company because most students will go though a training period and couple of more months to really adjust to the work environment.

So the new rule will tremendously impact my life in the near future. But still I want to present my supportive opinion as objectively as possible.\n\nAs most of Americans know, the manufacturing sector of US economy has experienced a substantial job loss in the last decades. The unemployment in industry is not due to the competition from international students, but the shrinkage of manufacturing industry itself, which most STEM students work in. The cause of the shrinkage has its historical cause, the Bretton Woods system, which ensured Americans enjoying imported products at a cheaper price. But in order to maintain the benefits, it requires consistent innovation and industry upgrading. However, most talented US students nowadays choose not to major in STEM, for overwork and underpay (a sign of reduced competitiveness). This, in turn, will hasten the death of US manufacturing. This is the reason why US needs international students to replenish talents in industry, to make industry more competitive and back to the original track. This is the last chance for US to revive industry, otherwise in next few decades, it will lose competition against other countries as well as leading position in the world. But at this time I still consider US as the best land for innovation due to its spirit and system, and still believe that it has the chance.\n\nFor the above reason, I am supportive of the new rule to expand training opportunities for international students with STEM degrees, especially for those with advanced degrees. However, we must gain immediate attention to any behaviors that abuse these rules, for example, it is noticed that every year more than half of H1-B visas were used by a few companies, which play like employment agencies and directly hire people oversea with falsified resumes. Such behaviors undermine fair competition and cause further damage to STEM education and manufacturing industry in US. Therefore, while we expand the opportunities for international students in US, we must heavily regulate the companies who are directly hiring oversea.\n\nThe United State is a great nation of immigrants.

Extension is a good way for attracting students learning in U.S and contributing in U.S. As a F-1 student learning Statistics, I feel deeply that one of the reasons that make me want to apply for the program in U.S is the OPT extension. As we know, the H1B lottery is held every April, for students graduated who do not find jobs offering H1B or do not find jobs, OPT extension is the only way that they can have more time to keep staying in the U.S. Other developed countries, like UK, only allow foreign students one year to stay, so most of the students studying in UK I know, they come back to China after their study. As for master degree, most of the courses are aimed to preparing students to enter the industry, the easiest way is to find jobs in local. If only one year after graduation is permitted and no extension, I think most of the students may return to their own country after graduation, for now, some of my Chinese friends choose to build their career in China since there're more opportunities than before. In the future, STEM students may not even consider going to U.S to study further if they have less chance of working here longer. That'll be a great loss for both U.S university & industry. The reason why there's a classification between STEM and other majors is just because STEM majors can make more contribution in leading industries like technology. Since H1B now is a good policy to limit the number of immigrators, keeping the extension is a good way to attract more intelligent people coming to U.S and making contributions in U.S.\n\n2. Extension is good for competition, and competition is a good thing for country development. With extension, foreign people and local people will compete in finding jobs, serving in industry, ... etc. Employers will have more opportunity to select suitable employees from more candidates. Though competition may not be good for people themselves (there'll always be people lost their jobs), but it is good for the country development and it will always encourage people to improve their own skills.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoran Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16049", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM students are extremely important to USA both now and future.

And if workers with such training are actually needed, then these special training/mentoring programs should be open to Americans as well.  \n\nThe rule describes the hiring of skilled STEM OPT students, but if these students are already highly skilled why do the regulations state there is a need to educate the uneducated foreign student and to provide experience to the unexperienced foreign student?\n\nThese foreign students are attractive to employers since they generally are younger (lower cost) than U.S. STEM workers, especially considering employers save the 7.65 percent FICA and Medicare taxes by hiring them vs. U.S. workers.  These OPT workers hold good paying jobs but cost Social Security approximately $1 billion annually.  The OPT program does not even guarantee that the foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage.  \n\nThe proposed 3 year time period allowed for foreign students to work in OPT is the same amount of time that an H-1B Visa is valid.  This amounts to creating a shadow H-1B program, a violation of Congressional intent.\n\nIn March 2014, the GAO issued a report revealing that the program was full of inefficiencies, vulnerable to fraud, and ineffectively overseen.  Under the proposed rule, employers are to monitor and record their own actions in the Mentoring and Training Plan.  The rule contains no plan for the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with foreign workers.  It's left up to the employer to use his own method of proof of compliance, with intentional ambiguities to avoid holding these employers liable for violations of law.  And, the regulations don't impose ANY penalty for violations of the rules.  \n\nAs I stated in the previous paragraph, the worker protections in the new rule are very vague, deferential to employers, and likely to be virtually unenforceable in practice.\n\nThis rule/regulation is unconstitutional since ONLY foreign students get government help!  It requires employers and universities to unlawfully discrminate based on immigration status.\n\nThe rule is a sham to drive down wages in America by undermining job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nThank you for considering my comments.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jane Miller", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5706", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Although i'm never studied in the USA, I know many people from abroad who have made huge effort to go and study in the USA with hopes that it will open doors into work, internships and training.

This is obvious from the number of STEM job openings. The problem is not how many people are looking for such positions, but how many QUALIFIED people are looking for these positions.\n\n2. OPT employees will need to meet the wage standard in the region in order to be eligible to be employed. Therefore, this will not put US citizens at disadvantage.

Employers who hire OPT student will need be be qualified for E-verify, which means that they will have to treat each candidate equally, thus the point that US citizens will be at disadvantage is not valid. Treating everyone equally is exactly the US spirit, this is the base of what the US stands for.\n\n4. Having these OPT students hired for a few years will bring up consumption in the US (tuition, daily expenses etc). This attract MONEY INTO the US and is good for US economy.

These STEM related projects normally has a relatively long ramp up period due to the complexity of skills involved . It does not make sense to train these talents to get familiar with such projects. When they have just built up the connection between STEM theory learned in college and the industry application, and READY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE US, the US suddenly let go of these talents to contribute to other countries. With the 3 year STEM OPT, there is enough time for these talents to yield HUGE GAIN for the US economy. The contribution curve is also exponentially increasing. Therefore it is a total loss for the US to let go of these labors in the very beginning of their career.\n\nTherefore, this proposal HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED to PROTECT the interest of the US economy and to AVOID ANOTHER ECONOMIC CRISIS that could potentially be triggered by the loss of STEM talents in the US industry / loss of international STEM students in the education system. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kathy Rong", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21930", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think opt is a crucial opportunity for any students studying STEM in US from other countries.\nI really know and understand the concerns of some people who disagree with the proposal.\nI hope to say that the objective of OPT is not robbing the US students of their job opportunities  but create a better job market \nfor the whole country.

Would you agree with this person? I would say any reasonable person would not.\n\nWhat it turned out, however, is that a lot of people who opposed this new regulation, are proposing something like.\n\nContrary to what most of the people who object to this new regulation, STEM students who are on OPTs are not \"taking the jobs away\" from good hard working Americans, but they are helping to provide more opportunities on the market, and essentially benefitting both these students themselves as well as American citizens. For one, in dynamic industries, especially in those that involve ever-changing technologies, new innovations and ideas, jobs are not gold nuggets lying on the ground for the taking and the more people try to pick them up the less the average is going to end up with. Jobs are CREATED, they are one of many symbols of the growth of productivity in the industry and an indicator on the health of the system, when an industry is growing, it will open up opportunities for new comers as well as people who would like to make changes in their career. Such growth is enormous in the industries where people with STEM degrees are valued. But unbeknownst to many who oppose this new regulation, is how much the international students with OPT in their hands have contributed and are still contributing to this growth.\n\nIt is no hard to find someone from the media telling people that these international students are \"taking the jobs away\" simply by quoting a number of how many of these students are employed. However, the logic behind such claims are not much different from the claims that automated machinery and computers are taking away jobs from people when said technologies just started emerging, where said technologies eventually showed that more job opportunities are put on the market that ever before. And today, as these STEM students are contributing to help build and grow the technology-heavy industries they are in, more opportunities are available to people in the U.S than ever before. One can argue that many of these opportunities are being taken by STEM students as well, but the proportion of said cases are still relatively low. Meaning that still more opportunities are available to U.S citizens than what it otherwise could have been. On another note, the competition U.S citizens with STEM degrees face are not harsher than it should be. Rather, the ample workforce in the market combined with the fast growth of the industries will bring about a healthy environment for both the job seekers and employers.\n\nThe real problem Americans are facing is not that students with OPT are taking their jobs, but the fact that the time permitted for these students to continue training is too short. As any reasonable and rational person would understand, an industry with healthy growth needs more and more skilled workforce as well as fresh blood. The old OPT program provided these students with at most one year of occupational training. Such a short period of time made it so that students are receiving training to become good at what they do, but not much time is left for them to actually contribute to the industry. This created gaps of skilled workforce in the industries that U.S citizens cannot completely fill. Not only will such gaps of workforce stifle the growth of the industries, thus subject them to the risk of decline and massive lay-offs, but also it created an incentive for companies to choose outsourcing over growing their business locally, which not only means the loss of job opportunities to Americans, but also the capital fed back to the community through acts of consuming U.S-based services and products by the employees located in the U.S, citizens or international STEM students alike.\n\nI plead that people in the U.S make the wise choice to support and welcome the OPT Extension regulation, and protect the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit that defines this great country.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rui Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18326", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this propose.

As a result, this is putting additional adversity in the work place as it has currently effected the industry, impeding reasonable wages for all tech workers as the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay prevailing wage or the employer portion of payroll taxes.  It also has catered to and promoted language & cultural differences that impede efficiency and detract from common function both in the work place & community creating an environment that is mired in animosity & conflict.  Further taxing the American citizen to impart accommodation of foreigners whom many do not have the heart or willingness to acclimate to the character of our communities. Immigration policies should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it...!\n\nInitially, the Department of Homeland Security expanded the OPT program by bypassing the transparent notice-and-comment period. But the D.C. District Court ordered DHS to temporarily vacate the expansion. The judge has given DHS until February 2016 to complete the notice-and-comment period. Therefore, if enough comments opposing the rule are submitted, DHS could & SHOULD pull the proposed regulation entirely...!\n\nSincere regards, \nBrandon K.

And actually, this is a good plan for US citizens for the following reasons:\n\n1. There are not so many foreign students who are looking for a job in USA.\n(1) Some of them just want to have a better education experience, then go back to their countries.\n(2) Some of them are not good enough to have a position in either academe or industry, so they have to go back to their countries.\n(3) The rest of them may look for a position in academe or industry, who can be further partitioned into several parts:\na. Wherever in academe or industry,some of them will go back to their countries in a short time for some specific reasons, e.g. their family members (husband/wife/parents) don't want to live outside their countries; or they have better opportunities in their countries.\nb. Some of them want to be faculty in schools for a long time.\nc. Some of them want to have a job in industry for a long time.\n(4) Only persons in (3)b and (3)c will keep competing with citizens. However, there are two more challenges for job hunting.\na. Foreigners have worse communication skills than citizens, while communications are of great importance everywhere.\nb. A H1b visa or citizenship is required for positions in many companies.\n(5) Students can only look for positions that in STEM related areas. \nFinally, only a small part of foreign students are able to compete with citizens.\n\n2. Foreign students can make a lot of contributions.\n(1) Promoting the development of services near schools, especially housing and food services.\n(2) Large amounts of tuition contribute to the funding, which helps schools financially.\n(3) The achievements of talented students in academy can contribute to the reputation of schools, which makes the schools more attractive.\n(4) The talented students in both big companies and start-ups promote the development of related areas.\n(5) Positive competitions help the growth of US students.\nAll these above help develop USA and generate more job opportunities.\n\n3. This plan describes some constraints to protect the right of citizens, some examples:\n(1) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity. This increased the recruiting cost of a company for students with OPT.\n(2) The employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student. This helps to avoid \"foreigners over citizens\".\n\n4.

The nationwide call for increased STEM education has been heard, and this regulation helps increase this nation-wide initiative. However, I believe that it is unfair to single out F-1 nonimmigrant student visa holders who earned a degree in the STEM field, as opposed to increasing the OPT period for all student visa holders. If there is a need for additional workers in the industry that an F-1 visa holder earned a degree in, then they will find a place to obtain OPT. I don't think that opening the extension to all student visa holders would make that significant of a difference in jobs available to recent American graduates to justify it from happening. F-1 visa holders of all academic disciplines may participate in OPT for 12 months. The previous OPT extension for STEM disciplines was only an additional 5 months, which isn't so significant that it would cause a great discrepancy. Now that STEM students are allowed to participate in OPT for twice as long as non-STEM students, for 24 months, it un-levels the playing field dramatically. Our nation should be concerned with attracting the highest international talent, but what about international talent in any other field besides STEM? I believe that this regulation is unjust and excludes a segment of the international student population on our college campuses that we should be equally focussed on recruiting.

The people who are opposed to the OPT Extension policy should focus more on strengthening the management of illegal immigrants.\n\nSecondly, the government is very concerned about the employment of their own people, many of the institutions provide guidance and training to all the citizens. So they still cannot find a job, not because of the international students, but they are not willing to do or do not have the ability to do. More and more inventions are not created and developed by the Americans, they are content with things as they are instead of working hard. The people who have great ability will find a job anywhere, so creating more opportunities for international students will encourage the Americans to improve themselves. Where there is competition, there is progress.\n\nThirdly, City Sports in Boston had already gone bankrupt, Super fresh in East Coast would close down soon, and Citi Bank also closed all the branches in Massachusetts. That means economic slump has not bottomed out and that it may grow worse. In 2008, the subprime crisis destroyed the financial industry and the automotive industry, if the government decides to cancel the OPT Extension policy, it will be a CRUSHING BLOW to the technology industry, many companies (especially start-up) will lose a lot of labor and close down, innovation will stagnate.

From the experience of recent history of China,if a country want to be strong for a long time, it is very important for him to be open. Before 1900's,China had been always the strongest country all over the world.However,after 1900,the government closed the gate to the world.He didn't accept people from other countries and didn't send people to other countries for academic purpose.Then China fell.He was then defeated by many countries that had been weaker than him,even Japan.It took a long time for China to fight back for sovereign of the country.China has been developing very fast,as we all believe,since the publishing of REFORM AND OPENING-UP policy in 1980's. I think expanding the time of OPT is a sign that the United of States of America is going to be more open.This is a good policy that will definitely help America be even more stronger,where there are a lot of new countries challenging the position of America.Opening always means development.\n2. There are a lot of voices that said expansion of OPT will cause more native people can't find jobs.This argument is very ridiculous.Why natives can't find jobs?Why they don't think about their own reasons?Foreign students always work hard in schools,so they may be more competitive.This is why OPT students find jobs.If you want to live in a developing society,you have to compete with others.Expelling others will not help the society to develop.The reason why many natives can't find jobs is because they don't study hard or work hard.They are NOT competitive.Living in a society should not be that easy that even not working hard,a person can still be rich.This is not reasonable.And if everyone in a society doesn't work hard,finding a job is easy for everyone,the society,the country has no hope to be competitive in international competition.So OPT students will cause not only contribute more power to push the society to develop,but also push the natives to develop.\n3. There are many people saying that there has been enough foreigners in America as well,and they cause the damage to both living and nature environment.But what is the fact?I can't say that all OPT students in America are good,but as I know,most,at least 95%,of OPT students have good academic background,which means that most of students coming to America have a good behavior in their country,because it's absolute that good academic background always means good behavior.So who is hurting America?Natives and smuggling people.So my opinion in this case is that America should put more efforts into beating smuggling,not students most of who behave well in America.\n4. Although this reason has been repeated many times,I still want to say that OPT students really contribute a lot to development of America.They always have the highest cost compared to natives.They always have very high expense in studying.They contribute a lot no only in economy fields but also the academic fields.Many scientists,entrepreneurs come from foreign countries,such as Li Zhengdao,Yang Zhengning,both of who come from China,and CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella,CEO of Google Sundar Pichai,both of who come from India.\nAll in all,expansion of OPT has a lot of advantages that will make America better.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jun Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13706", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This would be a great rule for all students on OPT.

Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zicheng Huo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18516", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "There is currently a big push on to promote our children to pursue an education in the STEM field.

I benefited SO MUCH from the OPT law (12 month + 17 month of extension). Without that, I would have had to leave the US 6 years ago. US would have lost a talented, hard-working, and value-creating scientist since then. That's for me only. Imaging how many talented and accomplished scientists and engineers US would lose PER YEAR? Over ten thousands. Yes, over TEN THOUSANDS PER YEAR. Think about it, US people. \n\nI strongly support the 24 month OPT change, it's a great change for USCIS. It's a great change for USA. Thus, we would be even more focused on working hard and making the USA better and better. \n\nI am proud to be a LEGAL immigrant. I would be even more proud after seeing the 24 month OPT policy makes the life MUCH EASIER for tens of thousands of outstanding scientists and engineers per year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shawn Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19380", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We must stop giving American job opportunities to foreign workers.

This is because companies have to apply visa and process files for international employee, which means they need to pay more money and effort for hiring international employee. Moreover, some companies, for example which don't enroll E-Verify, can't hire international students at all. When you read recruitment flyer, it's not surprising to see \"US citizens-only\" for some job types.\n\nHowever as far as I know, there are still many international students working in American Companies. That means hiring managers are willing to give international students a chance even they know they need to pay more for this, and they also know that international students must have weaker English skills. According to my friends who are working at American Companies, the reasons are as following:\n1. International employee are diligent, they are willing to work overtime and don't claim any overtime pay.\n2. They don't complain that much. The United States is the best country providing reliable food quality, great environment, sufficient salary, etc. So working and living in the United States is really good enough, they are satisfied and there is no need to complain even sometime they feel tired.\n3. They are smart. You can tell that international students often have higher GPA in their study at US.\n4. They don't cause troubles. As far as I see, there are few international employee commit crime. They are well educated and honestly more cautious and timid.\n\nThus, international students have many special advantages in hiring managers' view even though they have less priority than American people. So this means, international employee are needed for their special value and the existence of international employee doesn't hurt the employment rate in the United States nor the efficiency of companies: if one American candidate is as good as an International candidate, the American candidate will definitely get the job offer because he/she has higher priority. If an International candidate wins a job offer while an American candidate loses, then the International candidate must be more potential, thus can contribute more to the company.\n\nIn summary, international students are a valuable source which contributes to US prosperity, especially in the areas of Science, technology and Engineering. They deserve to work longer and bring more benefits to American companies. The improvement and extension of OPT for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students is a great proposal for American companies, the United States as well as the students.\n\nThanks for your attention.\nBest regards.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ethan Zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19782", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is not only really beneficial to international students, but also let international students play a more fair game for their career among their peers.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Heng Chi, Rice", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1175", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Stop giving employers financial incentives to hire foreign workers before they hire American workers!

Its the key to keeping the leadership and dominance of the United States in the world.\n\nFirst of all, the OPT extension attracts many talented international students to come and contribute to the academia and industry of the US. If OPT extension were aborted, those international students may instead go to Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan or simply stay at their home country, and make those countries, not the US, stronger and more competitive in the world. Who would suffer from such loss? American people. \n\nSecond, as some of the opposite opinions argue, those international students are taking jobs away from Americans, i.e. unfair competition. But the truth is the OPT extension indeed guarantees the fairness of the job market. As said in the proposed rule by DHS on the OPT extension issue, only companies involved in the e-Verify system can hire OPT holders. And the e-Verify system is designed to assure the equality and integrity of job markets for all applicants. Therefore, Americans and those OPT holders are treated completely fairly on job markets.\n\nAdmittedly, some of Americans may also argue why on the earth we have to FARILY compete with those OPT holders since were citizens of this country? OK. Lets assume such argument makes sense at first. But in fact, the OPT holders have their natural disadvantage of getting a job. Imagine youre hiring new employees for you own company and you have two applicants, one American, one international OPT holder, both of which are similarly competent. Who would you choose? Are you gonna choose the intentional OPT holder in spite of the cultural discrepancy, the tedious job visa procedure and accompanying law issues, the difficulty of the OPT holder to involve in your company and the possibility that one day he/she just decided to go back to his own country all of a sudden? I think a wise manager would undoubtedly prefer the American applicant over the international OPT holder. As a result, its much easier for an American to get a job than his/her similar intentional counterpart. \n\nAs I just said above, if an international OPT holder is hired, he/she must be significantly more capable than his American competitors to compensate the extra effort the company spent. Thus he/she is able to contribute more to the company. What if the OPT extension were stopped and all those talented workers would be forced to leave? Who would suffer the most? Those American companies, which provide products and services to all American folks, which pay taxes to make the US government running and all the public facilities working, which make the US excellent in almost all industries. Should the OPT extension really be aborted, so that American people would lose all of those welfares?\n\nAs a conclusion, the OPT extension does all the good to the US and its people.

In the past couple months, the intensity over the OPT STEM Extension issue has been climbing to its peak.It is to a point that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has to act quickly and revise the original 17-month extension rule that was vacated by a federal court, because it matters to hundreds of thousands international students and millions of Americans' future. Now DHS has published its new proposal of 24-month STEM Extension, but surprisingly I have read quite a lot of negative comments that are incorrect. Here is my point of view in favor of this new proposal. \n\nThe international students who are on OPT STEM Extension have Not been \"stealing\" jobs from American workers, but creating More opportunities in America. The students who are eligible for this extension are the ones have incredible amount of knowledge in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, and the jobs are taking on are not the ones that every person can perform.They will get those jobs not matter what because American employers admire those talents which help create revenues. American companies need those talents to boost its economy. That was the reason President Obama started the original 17-month STEM Extension back in 2008 to achieve this goal -- to bring back the prosperous American economy!Now American economy has been much better than 2008 because every year an increasing number of international students/scholars/researchers came to the U.S to make a contribution. They liked the fact that they could stay here longer under STEM Extension to gain valuable experience and contribute to their projects and research. Perhaps a lot of them, including me, want to stay in the U.S LEGALLY for their lives because this country provides freedom, opportunities, and success.\n\nAfter my recent graduation I am planing on building a solar startup here in Detroit that aims to streamline the design process of solar energy system. I am confident that this will create jobs. And my ultimate goal is to implement sustainability and accelerate the young solar market. The U.S has the technology and funding sources that I need to make this happen. I became disappointed because right now some American people have the wrong impression towards internationals and put stress on my plan.Quite frankly, I thought about going to Toronto, Canada, or even New Zealand and Australia where have comparative open immigration policy for my startup. Many internationals like me need an opportunity for benefiting the society, it is just a matter of where they are getting this opportunity from. I love American culture. And I love my 7-year stay with host parents -- my American grandparents. We, as international students, just want to stay here and make a contribution. Thank you.

This action will not only benefit international STEM students, but also strengthen the science/technological power of United States, maintain the economy growth, and finally create more job positions for both immigrates and citizens.\n\nFirst,  24 months extension period will surely benefit the international STEM student, especially for recent years when the economy is stumbling. International students have already been tied with more restrictions than green card holder or citizen in many fields (Mechanical Engineer, EE, Environmental Management, etc.). It is really hard for STEM students to find a position within 1 year, which are hurdling their ability to contribute to this country. If the extension period can be lengthened from 17 months to 24 months, it will give STEM students more time to adjust themselves to the job market.\n\nSecond, lengthening the extension period from 17 months to 24 months will strengthen the science/technology power of United States. We all agree that the science/technological power is the key competitiveness of United States. However, it seems that: not everyone notices the fact that the science/technology power need people to contribute and do real research! Only when United States have people to do the research in science/technology can it beat other countries in the global competitions. As a result, STEM students are the most valuable resource to maintain the leading position of United States. International students consists a great portion of the population in STEM fields. The best strategy should be: keeping these STEM students in U.S, let them contribute to this country after getting the best training/education in U.S for several years. It will be stupid to push these STEM students back to other countries to increase their competitiveness over United States, using the best education they got from United States.\n\nThird, keeping the STEM students could give them more chances to contribute to this country, and maintain the economy growth, and finally increase the job position for U.S citizen. Many STEM fields (Mechanical Engineer, Mathematic, Physics) are too hard and too bored for most citizens. As the result, the citizen population is so small. However, this country need engineers to develop rockets in SpaceX, create autopilot cars in Tesla, need scientists crack equations in nuclear power stations, teach the next generation about the most marvelous wisdom human beings have ever created. Their jobs have great external effects and will benefit the entire economy, increase, not decrease, the number of job positions in this country. \n\nAbove all, I fully support the action of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiaoli Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0781", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support new STEM OPT proposed Rule.

Most STEM students work in science, mathematics and technology. They have brought huge profit to many US companies such as Google and Apple which are the cores of US economy. The current H1b policy has already driven a lot of people away when the candidates lose the lottery. The companies will lose more talented people without OPT STEM.\n2) Many universities offer degrees (especially graduate schools) that offer OPT STEM options. As far as I know, one of the reasons that many foreign students apply for these programs is because the OPT STEM. If the STEM is canceled, it is very likely that students will choose similar programs in countries like UK where the work visa is easier. As a results, the programs are likely to lose a huge amount of intuition which are usually only affordable to foreign students. \n3) US is a immigration country. Like it or not, US benefits from most immigrants. At the same time, US has a solid law foundation that ensure the country can benefit from immigrants. This way, US immigrants brings population to the country so that it does not age to much and provide competition to make the country's technology is always at frontline. If we compare to other developed countries such as France and Japan, US has a steady growth in economy and technology that no other countries can achieve. The immigration law has helped the economy a lot. If OPT STEM is cancelled, this will bring doubts to the immigration law of the country and its foundations.\n\nOverall, I support the new proposed rule on 24 month extension.

Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible Students:\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nAs Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa stated in a letter to President Obama:\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nZs Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis states:\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States. ...\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\nAs Richard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO states:\n\n\"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\"The next Sergei Brin might be sitting in an American classroom right now, but if that future innovator cannot get an entry-level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers, entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the United States.\"\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by J.

The OPT STEM extension should be retained for the benefit of STEM graduates.\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow the OPT students to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide them with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nWith this comment, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

I saw a lot of negative comments saying that passing this rule will decrease the job opportunities for US citizens. In my view, the result is just the opposite in the long terms. My reasons are as follows: \n\n1. In order to guarantee the job opportunities for all of the people, the creativity that brings new jobs is the most critical issue, instead of cutting the job opportunities for selected groups of people. Decades ago, heavy industries hired a lot of people for manufacturing products, and as automation came into applications, these jobs were significantly reduced. But people still embrace it, because automation needs more people to fill in new jobs such as programming and system designing. These new areas or job opportunities, however, can be brought by the collision of cultures and ideas of foreign people, where the United States have accomplished and now accomplishing well.\n\n2. The extended OPT gives more time for the talented foreign students to focus on their own areas of interests, so that more contributions could be brought by them. OPT is not a green card, it's just an extended exam which is more considerable for international people who are capable to show their advantages in a longer period of time. People should allow more chances for them to try and it is very likely that their ideas and capabilities could create more job opportunities for the entire country.

Foreign talents have made great contribution to US employers, US  government and US citizens by working hard, inventing new technologies, creating potentially significant value to Americans.   The OPT extension policy is among those policies. Since the OPT extension policy was issued, more and more international students have been attracted to  US to pursue their education in the US. They have contributed by paying tuition and living expense during school and kept contributed their creativity after graduation. As more and more international students come in, the situation  of H1B visa lottery become severe.  This severely prevent them from making contribution to the US. I would say if longer extension of OPT is possible, both the international graduates and US will benefit to a great extent. This is a win-win game.

But I actually do think it through. Following is my reasoning in response to a type of negative comments.\n1. Some people claim that the the talented STEM workforce will take away jobs from Americans and the government should protect their citizens in the job market.\nI think that those people who make such claims are already consider themselves less skillful and, instead of thinking about ways to improve their skillsets, they are just complaining and discriminating international skilled workers. Those people might forget how US remains to be the most powerful country in the world. It's the world-wide talents which US keep collecting in the past century that contributes significantly to the progress of the country. Also, don't forget many immigrants from 19th century are only admitted to US because they are skillful workers.\nI understand that some people want some protection from the government because they are born as her children. The truth is that the protection is already there. This OPT extension is simply a temporary duration permission. The working visa, H1b, is still capped at certain amount each year. US is still getting relatively steady amount of immigrants every year. During this temporary extension, if we work much better than ordinary Americans who were in the same position, it would be reasonable for us to get a chance to get our working visa here, isn't it? We work hard to earn it and we should deserve it, aren't we? Also, remember that the working visa now is a lottery system. So that's definitely another layer of protection for you and quite unfortunate for us, though. We want to work in your country and we'll abide by your rules. However, the rules should be made in a relatively fair way, or in other words, the rules are to be made in such a way that it can put US in a better position in the forseeable future.

I understand that the domestic students might concern that extending the OPT for STEM majors might make it harder for them to launch a job, or jobs are being taken away by international students. However, given that the majority of STEM majors are composed of international students and given the high demand of graduates with strong technical skills, it is reasonable that a lot of the employees at technology companies are international students. As a country that endorses diversities and promotes equal employment, qualities and skills shall be the main drivers for decision when the companies are hiring. I don't see that keeping the door open for international students will harm the domestic students. If the amount of domestic students major in STEM majors increase, I believe the presence of domestic students in the technology industry and more technical positions will increase. As everyone in the industry might know, having a 1 year working experience cannot add too much value to the resume. For those who are not able to get H-1B after 1 year of hire, they pretty much wasted a year since they will not be considered an experienced hire when they need to go back to their country and look for a new role. If the intend for OPT is for students to gain experiences, 1 year is far from enough especially for technical roles that require in-depth knowledge in a specific area. The U.S. companies also will suffer from the policy. They invest so much money and time to train a new hire and all the investments become worthless if the new hire has to leave the firm after 1 year.\n \nWhy are all those international students trying to remain in the U.S.? One of a major reason is that the start salary is much higher than in their own country. Of course, it is for experience, but let's be realistic, salary is a big selling point. If the STEM extension rule fails to pass, college graduates with strong mathematics/science/programming skills will go back to their country and find a job. The companies in the U.S. might not be able to find enough people with the required skills. It will cause the companies to outsource all the jobs to other countries. Great, in other countries, they could find all the college graduated from prestigious U.S. universities with the skills they are looking for. If that is the case, it will really harm the U.S.'s economy. Why are we only extending OPT for STEM majors? Why aren't we extending OPT for business majors? It is because that the U.S. needs STEM majors graduates, the companies need their skills, and the demand is far from being filled. \n\nNot only the international students need the extension in order to gain real world working experiences after their graduation, but also the companies, the market, and the U.S. need these group of people to improve the economy and help the U.S. stay in the lead in various fields. With all of the above being said, I truly do believe that the benefits will over-weight the harms for passing the STEM extension rule. \n\nThank you for your time and attention for reading through my comments!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yiqi Xin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6821", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a great proposal.

It also meets a false need created by high tech industry executives to use U.S. immigration policy to make available to industry cheap, exploitable, labor, at lower cost than they expect to pay American high tech workers, especially older workers who have more experience and expect higher pay.\n\nA recent (September 15, 2015) article in U.S. News and World Report notes that wages have been stagnant for programmers since the mid-1990s even though high-tech executives earn ever higher salaries.  The National Institutes of Health, my former funding source, has a program to help biomedical Ph.Ds. find work in related fields outside of their field of expertise.  The high-tech labor shortage is a myth created by industry to obtain from a supine, or really complicit, government, that creates programs such as H1-B, L-1, F-1, and summer internships for recent foreign graduates, to supply industry with cheaper labor it can exploit.  There is no high tech labor shortage when up to half of all graduates from American colleges cannot find jobs in their field.\n\nThe OPT program has the effect of discouraging American students from pursuing degrees in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) because American students know they wont be hired when cheaper foreign workers are made readily available to industry by programs such as OPT.  Is it the purpose of government to serve the interests of industry before making jobs available to Americans who by all rights deserve first crack at employment in the fields they have studied so hard to earn their degree?\n\nThe worst aspect of this kind of preferential hiring or foreign labor is the discouraging effect it has on American students, whether native or foreign born.  This is what Norman Matloff means when he says that such programs create an internal brain drain away from STEM fields.  Why get a STEM degree when the jobs go to foreign workers who are paid less or in the case of the OPT program, perhaps not paid at all as interns?  The thrust of U.S. immigration policy in servicing the cheap labor demands of the high tech industries is to cheat our own graduates out of the jobs they have worked for and deserve.   \n\nI strongly oppose the extension of the OPT program to 36 months.  Id much rather see the entire program cancelled after congressional hearings where opponents can demonstrate that the program is a political payoff to the tech industries and Silicon Valley in return for large campaign contributions.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Fred Johnson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4309", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think it is time to think about americans before it is to late.

You need to get rid of this amnesty program and anything that resembles it. Furthermore, WE DON'T WANT THESE ILLEGALS IN OUR COUNTRY. D-E-P-O-R-T THEM!  Do you understand this or not?

Please read the following email I've sent to many pro-immigration advocates and US Representatives, thank you:\n       What's wrong with the word illegal and what don't you understand about it. Look it up in the dictionary obviously you don't understand the meaning so I'll spell it out for you. It's spelled, I-L-L-E-G-A-L and it's exactly what these people are, so quit sugar coating it calling them \"Undocumented Immigrants.\" They are illegal and have no rights, privileges or protections under the Constitution of the United States and are not legal citizens. Start enforcing the laws that already exist. Deport them and if they want to re-apply for legal citizenship, let them do it legally. If the laws that are currently on the books had been enforced we wouldn't be in the predicament we are currently in. We don't need 11 million illegal immigrants in this country when unemployment is remains so high. This is also going to add to the healthcare dilemma as well as social security, Medicare, etc. Before any new immigration laws are passed that will create an influx of illiterate immigrants a law has to be passed making English the official language of the United States. All of our ancestors came here and kept their customs and identities but they all learned English. They knew that in order to get ahead and be able to communicate with each other this was a necessity. The illegal's that have recently come to this country don't appear to be as willing and this has created a major problem with education. Public education is guaranteed but the cost of interpreters needed to translate English into the immigrant's native language isn't cost effective and causes a tremendous and unfair burden on current legal citizens and taxpayers. This is wrong and totally unacceptable. You have to look at the big picture and see what other problems this is going to create before you pass a bill that's only going to make matters worse than they are and cost the American taxpayers more of their hard earned money.\n     Furthermore, how ironic and despicable it is that you want to give Illegal Citizens rights they haven't earned and don't deserve while at the same time you want to take legal US citizens 2nd Amendment rights away. Wake up, smell the roses and get your priorities straight.\n    Make it a Class A felony with mandatory minimum 10 years imprisonment to hire, rent, feed or offer shelter to illegal aliens that would rapidly help resolve the problem. This would also stop the exploitation of illegals by US citizens and remove the temptation for illegals to come here in the first place.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bob Prosser", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5641", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Expanding foreign worker green cards takes jobs away from Americans.

There is a huge demanding for the high level graduate students from these majors, however, just take a quick glance at the compositions in courses such as computer science, electronic engineering, etc., it is obvious that quite few students are really US citizens. Take my class for example, there are 59 master students majoring at Computer Science in my school, however, only 2 of them are owning the US Citizenship. Can you really imagine that the companies can hire sufficient labor only from US citizens? Do a simple math, or even comparison between the figure of the students majoring at STEM and having US citizenship, and the figure that the employees the companies need, the answer is obvious.\n\nThere is an opinion that the companies can pay less to hire the foreign students. However, there is no evidence to support this at all. The real reason that the companies are willing to hire more STEM studens is simply because the companies have no many choices. As well known, the salaries for the computer science major students are even higher for the STEM students than those US Citizens. Usually, the US citizens are not quite willing to take these difficult majors. Also take my company for example, it is an American company, however, there is no US citizen in my company, simply because we could not find any US citizens with such skills.\n\nWell, another reason, all people around world understand the essence of US--Freedom, and refuse to this propose is so ridiculous to happen in the US. Even though, I bet that every one has to admit that the most important factor for a coutry to develop is technology, which is developed by well educated people. Just imagine that the STEM students failed to work in the USA, what would they do? Almost for sure, they will go back to their own country, such as China, India, Korean, etc., and work for their local companies. Then, will this be a great deal for the USA? Do you want to have another version of FACEBOOK and GOOGLE developed by the STEM stduents in China or India? At least, these huge companies, FACEBOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER, AMAZON, etc. who hired, are hiring and will hire more and more STEM students, can make a huge amount of taxes and other contribution to the world, as well as the American Culture. Beyond this, more and more talented and skilled persons will be scary to move to the USA, since they would think that the USA government does not cherish knowledge and skill at all.\n\nIt is also very short-sight to decline this proposal, just to have more jobs available for US citiznes. The taxes and revenue created by these companies can in turn create more and more jobs for all people, including US citiznes.\n\nBesides above, there are many other reasons that I don't have time and space to express here.\n\nI really appreciate that the government would take my opinions into consideration.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yu wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18442", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is very good to the court's decision.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. \n\n    There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers. \n\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range so they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year in unpaid taxes.\n\nIan Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute:\n          \"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.\"\n          \"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\n           DHS \"is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.\"\n        \"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\"\n        \"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\n   If you think this is only an ideological argument wait until your son or daughter can't find a decent job.

However, I finally chose to study in the US because I think it could provide me optimal education resources and research facilities. It also provides me the chance to get industry training experience, so that when I come back to China I can be more competitive compared with my peers.\n\nI am just one of those international students who are attracted by the US education system and come here. What we bring along with us are our passion, knowledge and creativity. We have seen the success of many large companies such as Apple, Facebook and Amazon, which enroll thousands of STEM students every year. We also have played an important role in start-up companies. It is not exaggerating that we have indirectly affected the US's economy. \n\nHowever, under the current OPT program many talented students have to leave the US and give up their dreams. Just take myself for example, if I knew that I had little chance to stay here legally after graduation, I would prefer to go back to China immediately after graduation. By doing so I am able to better control my future career. However, if I do so, all the education investment spent on me during my five years PhD life could not be converted to benefit outputs in the US.

Why is a US citizen at Disneyland working in IT losing his job to a foreign worker?\nThe whole immigration system is a failure and and a national security problem.\n\n\nImmigrants Arent the Only Ones Who Shouldnt Be Voting\nJULY 24, 2015  Ryan McMaken\n \n\nMuch of the current immigration debate in the United States centers around the issue of amnesty, which is a vague term that may mean anything from we wont deport you to lets fast-track you to citizenship and voting rights.\n\nFrom a laissez-faire perspective, the deportation aspect of amnesty  an increase in federal inaction  is one thing. The extension of voting privileges, though, is something else entirely.\n\nIndeed, the amnesty debate has helped to illustrate the difference between real, concrete property rights, and the much different political rights such as voting. Limiting property rights is always illegitimate. Limiting political rights, on the other hand, may sometimes be essential.\n\nProperty Rights vs. Political Rights\n\nFor example, everyone everywhere has property rights regardless of the type of regime they live under and whether or not the government recognizes the existence of those rights. These rights include the right to own ones own body, to own property peacefully acquired, and to enter into peaceful contracts with other people, including contracts involving employment and housing. The foreign nationals known as illegal immigrants also have these rights.\n\nBut property rights such as these should not be confused with political rights that are quite distinct from the right to self-ownership. In fact, in practice, political rights such as voting are often used to justify coercion against others in the form of expanding government spending, and government control over every aspect of daily life.\n\nCritics of amnesty who wish to further restrict the free use of property by employers, landlords, and laborers make a mistake when they try to limit immigration by restricting property rights. On the other hand, they are on more solid ground when they attempt to restrict the further expansion of government power by restricting the franchise and the number of people eligible (via citizenship) for government checks.\n\nThe assumption behind this position on immigrants is that new arrivals tend to seek an expansion of government benefits, and that they are net tax receivers who get more in tax benefits than they pay in. This is an empirical claim that may or may not be true. But, it is no doubt true that some immigrants are in fact net tax receivers, and it is in that direction that we should direct our attention.\n\nLimiting Government Size by Limiting the Vote\n\nIn making their arguments against expanding the vote to immigrants, the activists who hold this position place themselves among the few who are actually confronting the problem of widespread voting rights in a society where large numbers of net tax receivers also have the ability to vote further benefits for themselves.\n\nHowever, when we really start to examine the sheer number of voters who benefit from expansions in government spending, immigrants begin to look insignificant by comparison. The legions of government employees, government contractors, and Social Security recipients all know that any significant cuts in government spending would hurt them personally. And they vote.\n\nSo, if were going to take the position that those who benefit from tax funds should not vote, why limit ourselves to looking at immigrants?\n\nThe Net Taxpayers vs. the Net Tax Receivers\n\nIn his short book Bureaucracy, Ludwig von Mises examined this problem in the context of government employees. In a section titled The Bureaucrat as a Voter Mises explains:\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ernest Paviour", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3535", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This would benefit US economy to grow much stronger because after having learnt from professors here, knowledge from the students/ skilled people can be utilized here for development of country.

If you ask me, there are even NOT enough opportunities for international students. Also foreigners are not as competitive as natives in job market because other than the skills, knowledges and experiences, the culture difference on probably the entire life till now is a HUGE disadvantage for us international students.

The problem is rooted from children lacking interest in STEM, thus not choosing this career path, and of course this problem could only be solved temporarily by using foreign workforce. If we do not attract more children into STEM related fields, the problem would be worse and worse.

The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at Facebook, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development.

The extent opt can appeal more international students. Since most of the STEM students are high educated, they can have a long benefit for the technology industry. Many programs need large amount of time to conceive and test before it can have real contribution to the society, thus the extent opt enables creative ideas to come true. If international students are forced to go back home after one year, they would probably loose their interest in considering coming to American for further education. Without many people who are elites in their own countries coming to USA, I believe the economy and technology would decrease in the long rum.\n2. The housing, food, entertainment industry are bound to benefit from the increase in the number of international students. Not only study, international students need time and space to rest and recreate.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.\nOPT serves the only way where an International student can apply their classroom based knowledge into the real practical world. The extension makes a STEM graduate ready for practical real world immersion. The additional OPT time would allow students like me get valuable experience and practical insight of the knowledge I have gathered in a classroom. On the other hand it will allow Employers to remain competitive globally through innovation which will in turn fuel the US economy. \nAfter carefully reading the below comments, it is seen that most of them are just trying to pit native born students against International students, while this is never the case. The American economy is dynamic and powerful enough where people of all race, religion and nationality have come together to build it. Most gains in the US economy has come through skilled workforce who have earned their degrees through American Universities.  Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers. A skilled workforce is what a country needs to stay strong and grow economically. \nI urge you to help us build a great economy by supporting this rule.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ashish Shetty", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11011", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Enough already - we have thousands of unemployed college graduates begging for jobs in their field.

Throughout its history, the United States has been leading in many scientific, technological, and economical areas. These leaderships have largely relied on the continuous attraction and absorption of highly-educated professionals in various areas, and OPT (including extension and cap-gap relief) for international students is a vital part of it.

Unfortunately, it evoked a great crisis for not only Chummy itself, but also a group of Facebook's Chinese engineers that had provided such services to the tourists.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jim Green", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19531", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is an attack on American workers.

This is a Win-Win solution for several different related parties.\n\n\nThe US government, or we may say the country of the US, is the major one who benefits, because this policy would keep qualified talents staying in the US to contribute their skill and wisdom to help America retain its the strongest scientific and technological power in the world wild. Those people who are eligible for OPT extension are highly educated and well trained people in high tech area. The offer of job already proved the ability of these candidates. A lot of people will leave without the extension because they may not be able to get H-1B too. They will find a place in other countries to develop their career and contribute their wisdom. That means the US loses talents and other competitor gets. It may not impact the position of America immediately, but its predictable that there is negative impact to America in long term.\n\n\nAnother party which would be helped by this proposal is employers. A lot of high tech companies have very diverse employees, and a part of them are students who have master or PHD degree  in F-1 OPT status. The company usually chooses employee with its strict criteria. A typical employee process has to go through HR, financial, Hiring Team etc departments, and to through advertisement, phone screen(a lot), phone interview(a lot), then on-site interview(a few) steps. It usually takes months to settle down one position. A tons of money and effort are spent for every hiring. In addition, companies need continue spend money and effort to train new employees to let them adapt to the environment. However, the company will lose the OPT employee very soon because the employee may not have working permission. How painful it is! Yes, employers wont have this problem if they simply dont hire F-1 Nonimmigrant students. Unfortunately, because of the criteria of the job position, its not easy to find qualified candidates. This OPT extension proposal will release the pain for employers, as there is enough time to help their employees settle down and keep improving and contribute themselves.\n\n\nThe last but not the least party is individual. No matter what reason brings an international student come to the US, a common object for him/her is success. After spent tons of money($40,000 ~ $60,000 for a master, much more for PHD) for education, and suffered stressful job hunting process, eventually got a dream job, no one would like to be kicked off just because of the immigration policy. Does individual who is native get benefit from their foreign colleagues? I would say yes. My current company has such a good open culture. I have colleagues from every continents. People are smart, respectful, and working hard. I believe its a very good environment for everyone no matter where he/she is coming from. \n\n\nIn consequence, this is good for a lot of people. I definitely vote to this proposal.

The Proposed Rule ignores the impact on American workers and \"STEM\" graduates. \n\nDHS predicts the number of non-student aliens working on student visas will be greater than the H-1B quotas. DHS has given no consideration in the rule about the effect this huge volume of foreign labor will have on the job market. The term \"law of supply and demand\" is not to be found anywhere in the proposed rule. Currently half of American graduates in \"STEM\" fields cannot find jobs in \"STEM\" fields after graduation. This rule makes it even harder for American graduates to find jobs and DHS has given no consideration to that factor. \n\nA number of the commenters have noted the problem American workers have finding jobs in STEM fields. E.g. ICEB-2015-0002-3470, ICEB-2015-0002-5532, ICEB-2015-0002-5528, ICEB-2015-0002-5619.\n\n11. The allowance of unemployment on OPT is inconsistent with education and protections for U.S. workers.\n\nAn unemployed worker is not a student and is not engaged in a training program. Non-student aliens should not be allowed to be unemployed and unsupervised while on student visas.\n\n12. DHS cannot justify the increased duration of OPT.\n\nDHS states the need for non-student aliens to engage in \"meaningful\" projects to justify the new 3-year+ duration of OPT. The only support it has for term is NSF research grants. Yet, DHS has no information on how many OPT workers end up working under such grants. \n\n\"DHS requests public comment regarding the length of research, development, testing and other projects for which STEM graduates (regardless of nationality) from U.S. universities are typically assigned in the workplace.\"\n\nDHS should have solicited that information BEFORE deciding on the 36-month+ OPT term, rather than asking for an after-the-fact justification for a decision it has already made. My first significant software development project after college lasted one year. \n\nThe average time a new graduate stays at a first job is only 18 months.  A three-year term for OPT is excessive. \n\n13. DHS relies on bad information in the proposed rule.\n\nDue to length, I am not going to analyze each citation. As with the 2008 OPT Rule, DHS relies on poor sources of information to justify the rule and misstates the conclusions of studies. ICEB-2015-0002-2014 identifies one such issue. As before, DHS has only looked at studies that support its conclusion and has not looked at information that contradicts its conclusion. I do point out that there is no nationality data for inventors on patents so studies linking rates of patenting to immigration policy are inherently bogus.  DHS needs to go back to the drawing board and review the full range of related information. As a starting point, I recommend to  DHS Michael Teitelbaum's book \"Falling Behind.\" \n\nHad DHS consulted with the full range of Americans affected by the OPT program in advance, it could have avoided the problem of relying on dubious sources to justify the rule.\n\nI also point out the bogus statistics thrown out by some supporters of the rule as part of a mass mail campaign. ICEB-2015-0002-0331, ICEB-2015-0002-0492, ICEB-2015-0002-4693, ICEB-2015-0002-1558, ICEB-2015-0002-0705, ICEB-2015-0002-0835, ICEB-2015-0002-0331 (\"Mass Mail Campaign 22\"). \n\n14. The proposed rule creates national security issues.\n\nThe recent GAO report on OPT highlighted the problem of poor tracking of non-student aliens working on student visas. Visa overstays are a large problem in the immigration system. For example one of the 9/11 hijackers had been admitted on a student visa. Requiring schools to track former students who have not been in attendance in the last 3- to 3-1/2-years is unrealistic and creates a security issue. Worse yet, allowing aliens to be unemployed on OPT (with no one to track their status) flies in the face of the security duties of the agency and the statutory requirements of student visa status.\n\n15. The propose rule will discourage Americans to study in technology fields.\n\nA number of commentators noted the obvious: the proposed rule will discourage Americans from studying STEM fields. E.g., ICEB-2015-0002-3316, ICEB-2015-0002-2994. Many commentators noted that family members cannot find technology jobs. ICEB-2015-0002-4738. Already, half of Americans studying in those fields cannot find a job related to their education. As a number of other commenters noted, DHS is encouraging aliens to enter the U.S. STEM job market under taxation terms that make them much cheaper to hire than Americans. ICEB-2015-0002-3576. DHS is also requiring employers to provide these foreign guestworkers mentoring programs that are not available to Americans. \n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by John Miano", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9808", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "One more point to support OPT STEM extension plan:\n\nAbout some people's point on \"OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013\".

As well, his analysis based on the number is misleading. He assumed 430,000 jobs denied for citizen worker because there are all together 430,000 OPT 12-month are issued. Note that OPT issue does not guarantee an employment. The issue of OPT is just enable a student to have illegal status as a job seeker. Finding a job is a rough road for them, as I analyzed previously. For my friends nearby, less than half of them finally end up with a job during OPT status. More and more people choose going back to home country as the growing development in economics and technology industry in China, even though their OPTs are issued. This is the real example in top university Columbia. The rate in other universities even much lower. Let's take a look at of the number of 17-month OPT STEM. The ratio is only 14.7% for STEM extensions to 12-month OPTs. It is low as I said, many students going back to home country for careers finally. STEM students are only taking up one part of international students. Though it is not denied a number of them have changed to status to H1B which gives longer time as work status, please note H1B issue amount is greatly reduced by a method of lottery. It means alien amount with long time working status is safely controlled. And thus, OPT or OPT STEM extension is just a temporary status.

This will cause greater job loss to Americans. Currently, many American jobs are shipped overseas, but this regulation forcibly gives American jobs to foreigners present in the U.S. The regulation actually rewards employers for hiring foreigners, and punishes them for hiring Americans. Other reasons are as follows.\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nThere are many more reasons to prevent implementation of these measures.

As for how this is beneficial, with more than 880,000 students coming over to the US for educations purposes which if not in all aspects but most of them help the universities run without closing doors(by helping them to stay and contribute) to local americans it also helps keep jobs within the US. Most americans do not realize how much deficit actually exists within the STEM field, even americans with STEM degree's do not wish to work in such fields as amount of work to money gained is less when you compare what people make on wall street or in the MBA market. \n\nThis may be a hard truth for few to swallow but to remain ahead in the field of technology its vital that the best talent be brought here to the US and kept so as to benefit from the value they bring. With all this talk about OPT students being paid less than their american counterparts I completely disagree, in most of the cases I know its higher than the american counterparts since every student comes with a master's degree. Even if there are cases which might be the case this new rule puts into place a checking mechanism that helps eliminate the fear.\n\nI believe its more important for america to keep the jobs in america by any means necessary rather than outsourcing the jobs to a foreign nation.

There are a number of reasons why this rule should be implemented as outlined below:-\n\n1) A student pursuing a masters or a PhD has to go to extreme lengths to first get admission, funding, to graduate in good standing and finally to obtain a position in the industry. These individuals like me are well educated and envision a better life by advancing the area in which they specialize by playing key roles in the industry. Such a proposed extension would not only help the US Economy but also help the United States retain the talent it nurtured. If not implemented, there is always a risk of losing out talent to other countries.\n\n2) Secondly, with more time given to STEM students to thrive in the country, it also gives interested students a chance to innovate and establish new companies and ventures. The entrepreneurship brought in by the non-immigrant STEM workers will also benefit the US STEM workers by creating more jobs in the industry.  \n\n3) The alternate view of non-supporters of this proposal might counter with the argument that US based workers are losing out on jobs because non-immigrants get paid less and are hired by employers because of less demands. However, we should note that a country like United States promotes free competition to make everything better, be it the market, education or the industry. Furthermore, most employers specifically state that they do not discriminate against any person with regard to country of citizenship, age, sex and so on. Considering the employers do follow the law and obey fair industry practices, this only leaves out knowledge, skills, experience and suitability for the job as important factors to actually attain employment.\n\n4) Some comments also mentioned that many citizens are in debt while opposing this rule. However we should note that the cost of tuition that a recent graduate has to pay for 2 to 5 or even 7 years of higher education is enormous and by the time such an individual enters the industry, he/she is most probably already is debt. This implies that debt is a universal thing be it with US citizens or non-immigrants and is not the only differentiating factor to oppose this proposed policy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10467", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I believe the extension of OPT is benificial because it allows international students contribute more on US economy and technology development.

The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nTo guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. This is deceptive. The Regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S.worker. The Regulation deflect the issue away from this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same {undefined} size anywhere in the world.Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student.\nIt Is Noted That The Regulation Does Not Refute That The U.S. Has Plenty Of Home Grown Scholars And Stem Student.\n\nThe Regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign student. Instead, the Regulation leaves it to the imagination of the employer DHS anticipates that employers have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices. Of course, the ambiguous language is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law.\n\nThe Regulation failed to mention the most obvious documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers are the employers payroll and personal records. What an employer is paying his current employees is direct and relevant evidence of how and what the employer values competent work. Instead, the Regulations allows the employer to hide the documents that it actually relies on and use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys, to set compensation for their U.S. workers. In short, the Regulations allow the employer and DHS to ignore reality (I.e. what is actually happening) ad substitute fantasy (i.e.what the employer and DHS hope is happening.)\nFurther, the Regulations would not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business but, in stead, would open such definitions to the world by providing the Department of Labors Office of Foreign Labor Certification.\nIf the DHS cared to protect the U.S. worker, then, the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. EMPLOYEE. That would protect the U.S. worker.\n\nThe regulation provide for on site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should/must conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet BOTH the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S.workers is in any way adversely impacted. Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the PAST FIVE (5) YEARS WITH NAMES, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS.\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers. The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.\n\nFinally, the Regulations fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regulation, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for fraud leaves the victimized American still goes without proper compensation.\n\n\nGET RID OF THIS LAW. \n\nVito Nick Giotta\nVisalia, California 93277", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vito Giotta", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4211", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This extension will be one of the wisest decision made by DHS.

The reality is, more often than not, its used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and for employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nBy increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT \"experiment\" to 3 years, the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid, there is little doubt that this regulation has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional LAWS.. The OPT regulations are irresponsible and dangerous at best. This \"regulation IS a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. As stated This DHS OPT rule effectively requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\n\nAlso noted there are no training or educational requirements defined in this program. This \"regulation\" is just one more foreign worker program and it has little to nothing to do with students. Since the bonus given to employers for hiring a Foreign graduate (worker) is worth $10,000 it is more profitable for an employer to hire a F-1 student than a citizen graduate. It's an over-reach to claim that someone who completes a degree in as little as 36 months needs 36 months of interning.

However, if the extension is gone, companies will be under great risk hiring international students since it's unsure whether these students can still stay in the company next year. \nEvery year the number of students coming to US for study is continuously growing, which boosts education income and local economics. When we arrived this land, we was told about the freedom, the American dream. We must work harder than others just for a fair opportunity. We always believe that any effort will has its rewards. However, if OPT extension is canceled, I can imagine that thousands of will loose their job and more than thousands of students planning to go study in US will change their mind.

My reasons are as followed.\nFirst, I am a international student. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at XXX, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by HAOHAO TANG", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13209", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "A longer period of OPT extension is critical for international students to be able to contribute to US technology and economy, otherwise the educated people will just be educated and leave.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ava Tong", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21972", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The proposal enable US employers to incorporate more high-quality candidates and stimulate positive competition among current employees,which can bring the enterprise up to a new level, attracting both domestic and international perspective employees.\n\nIn addition, the expansion of training opportunity will allow F-1 nonimmigrant students to receive systematic training from employers, making them more professional, adaptive, and experienced workforce.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Liming Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22159", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this opt 24-month extension proposal. \nTo start with, I believe it makes no sense that OPT students will grab American's working opportunities.

Base on this belief, I came to US to pursue high-end education and contribute to the society. However, upon graduation, the overwhelming strict immigration rules of US makes everything much harder. \n\nIt is the first time I have to deal with all the immigration regulations when I started to looking for a job, and that's how I found it America probably not what it was claimed as. As a country claimed as welcoming workforce and intelligence from all over the world, the US doesn't seem to be really hospitable. I found a lot of situations where the job was \"permanent residence only\", and even for those job we can take, it was highly restricted by the immigration rules. Here comes to the OPT regulations. \n\nIt is clearly 1 year OPT is too short for foreign students to really accommodate themselves with all the immigration regulations. Please notice it is not because of lack of any personal skills, but simply because of some regulations they have no choice with, no matter how hard they work. This is actually another kind of discrimination, to the immigrants who work hard to make a better living in this country, and it is against the core value of the United States.\n\nSTEM students are a group well-educated, intelligent and highly skilled people, and I see no reason why a well developed country won't welcome these people, they will surly make a positive effect and great contribution to the whole society and the country. \n\nAs H1B has a cap since 2008 and everything there will be certain amount of people can't get the working Visa on time, this population is accumulated so that the situation become worse and worse. Currently even for advance degree holders only half of them can get H1B every year, and because the rest will roll over to the next year, things just getting worse. At this point, the OPT extension set back to 12 months will force most of these talents won't be able to work here, which I believe is a tragic loss to the nation. \n\nMoreover, around 120,000 people who already got OPT extension of 17 months will be highly effected if this rule is not passed. This will not only be a problem for themselves, but also to the companies who hired them. It will create a tremendous mess situation to most tech companies hiring STEM students.\n\nBased on above reasoning, for the benefit of all the well-educated people, the industries hiring STEM students, the US economy and, most importantly, the core value of the nation, I hope this rule will get passed and take effect as soon as possible.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yang Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15025", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule to pass.

For the following reasons, first of all, 24-month extension on optional practical training (OPT) is absolutely advantageous things for certain students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from U.S.  Currently, science, technology, engineering and mathematics are main focus the USA want to promote it. The main power and competition of USA all come from science, technology, engineering and mathematics. But USA government can not only just relies on the USA citizens's ability, an extension OPT definitely can attract all kinds of genius from all around the world. Moreover, the students like Chinese people and Indian people are famous as their hard-working and intelligence. So the USA government should use their ability and intelligence to build up and promote the development of technology and engineering to the USA society. Secondly, some people may disagree about this proposals that some many international workers can take over their job opportunities. However, without pressure from these international people, USA citizens tend to be more lazy and slack. For a long term consideration, it is not a positive results and consequences. STEM extension actually can motivate the international people and USA citizens both work harder and effective. Although OPT extension will produce competition, competition and pressure always force people to exploit their maximum ability and intelligence they never have chance to seen before. If the USA government want to look for a long-term and progressive development specially in technology, engineering, science and mathematics, collaboration with various elements definitely boost the whole all strength. I am really the necessary and properly to pass this proposal that allow the STEM students to have more chances.

For example, the total revenue of Google is 66 billion in 2014 and almost 83% of its employees are international workers. Due to the original policy of opt intension, they are able to profit the company for the most and promote the development of science for this country. Keeping this policy and extend the opt time for 24 months not only gives them more chance to apply for the H1B Visa but  also keep the fresh blood for the development of different industries.\n  Secondly, it is ridiculous that some extremists think that the international students take their job opportunities. For most of the majors in stem, international students is the main components of such majors which the domestic students are less willing to attend and most of them outperform than the domestic students in such practical fields,such as computer science and electrical engineering. If the extension is canceled. The lack of talented people in IT industry for example, will goes its way down in the long term and American will lose strength in national defense and security.\n \nThirdly,the average salary from H1B last year is about 100,000 each year. They pay average about 15 percent of their income to US as tax. We all know US is in big amount of debt for this social welfare which gives its economy a trouble. If we keep those young people in our country and let them keep paying taxes. It will release the financial burden of US significantly. With the taxes paid by opt users, we can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xucan Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14793", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am totally against this expansion of the OPT rule.\n\nLet's focus on AMERICANS and their needs for a change.\n\nStop this madness.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Roger Payne", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7307", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "i believe this is a very important step for US to recover the economy and push to be the leader in the technology related area.

There is definitely no need to worry about this. Most international students come to America to get high-level eduction, i.e. masters or PHDs. And the employees need to sponsor their visa application if they want to hire an international student. Therefore, an international student is much more expensive than a local American. Unless really needed, an employer would definitely prefer a citizen rather than hiring a foreign student. Moreover, we international students come to America to seek better life. We paid the high tuition in the hope that we can get a good job after graduation. So we would not accept a lower payment for a job.

International students not only brings fresh energy and divers ideas in academic field, but also enhance economic prosperity of the country. According to Institute of International Education, in 2013 to 2014, 31.0% of foreign students are from China, 11.6% from India, both of which are developing countries. Students from these countries are more likely to use OPT Extensions, which allow them to gain good working experience in a developed country like United States before returning to their home country. OPT Extension proves to be a great attractions to foreign students when they chose which country to go. Take me as an example. I am a foreign student from China, I choose to pursue master degree in US because of United States's OPT and OPT Extension policies, which offers me the chance to receive not only excellent academic education, but also industrial experience from top-tiered company in my career field. I consider this chance overweights the expensive tuition fees a lots. If OPT Extension is cancelled, then education institutes in Unites States will lose the one and the most critical attractions to foreign students comparing to countries I mentioned above, consider the comprehensive price-performance ratio of high tuition fees and living expense, as well as the education quality. \nSecondly, OPT Extension allows employers in the United States to benefit not only from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired OPT STEM students, but also their knowledge of markets in their home countries. In the recent years, U.S companies are investing overwhelmingly increasing money into China market. As the largest potential market in the world, China is opening the market gradually to follow the trend of Globalization and companies like Uber and Expedia are already stepping into the market.

This is totally wrong. The only reason that the government want to extend this OPT is because most people study and work in STEM fields are foreign people and without the extension of this new rule, it is highly possible that a huge amount of good engineers will leave and STEM industry will break down. It is US citizens then who will suffer most.\n\n(2) Some people say that over 430,000 American jobs were taken from 2009 to 2013 because of the OPT extension.\nThis is soooo funny and please allow me to laugh for a few minutes. I do not need to mention that only 85,000 can be chosen for h1b each year, so at most 425,000 are chosen. But among these chosen people, a huge amount will be declined. Also, for years like 2009 to 2011, less than half of 85,000 are used because of the economy crisis.\n\n(3) Some people say that the old OPT extension spend over 4 million from Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\nThis dose not make any sense. Don't you think we STEM students pay tax while we work during these extension time? I don't need to mention that about 47% of US citizens do not pay tax at all, right?\n\n(4) Some people say that STEM students are cheap labors and stole their jobs as a result.\nCome on, we are not fool! If the company does not pay us a reasonable salary, why not we just go back to our own country and find a better job? Not to mention that the living spends here are much higher than my own country.\n\nTo sum up, those who think that this new rule will stole their chances for work are either know nothing about STEM industry environment or too lazy to learn a skill for working in STEM field and can not compete with foreign STEM people.\n\nLet me tell you the truth. During my MS degree time, I found that nearly all STEM students and professors and from foreign countries such as China and India. Right now, you can go to silicon valley to see how much they depends on foreign labors. If this rule does not pass, I am afraid that there will be a crisis for west part of US. I think the only difference between this one and the one that happened on 2008 is that this new crisis is cause by those who do reject DHS new rules on purpose.\n\nI think those that really rob US citizens' jobs are either from ICC and illegal immigrants. Their behaviours not only takes too much H1B chances illegally, but also make the average salary very low. We STEM students also hate them very much. So just leave this new STEM rules along and ask government to find a way handle ICC and illegal immigrants. They are the real reason that you US citizens can not find a job, it has nothing to do with STEM extension, believe me.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Roy Jia", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17539", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\nRecently firms such as Disney and Southern California Edison have replaced American tech workers with foreigners and forced them to train their replacements.

Be assured, this policy does way much more good than bad to the nation.\n\nFirst, for the panic comments, extending OPT does not affect job opportunities for U.S. citizens. You could not image how much easier it is for a successful STEM student with citizenship to get a job compare to other fields, let alone to foreign STEM students. Most citizens do not want to study STEM fields because it requires very hard working and they get paid the same studying much easier majors. That is why there was this policy at the first place, to replenish the insufficiency of workers in STEM fields, not the other way around. Although the majority of college students in STEM fields work hard, some do not and are incapable of handling the job. If you just want to guarantee every STEM college student to have a job no matter how incompetent they are just to stimulate citizens to study in those field, then the nation won't be able to compete with any other nations around the world who do admire hard working STEM students in their culture. And to make it worse, you send many hard working students to other nations. It is not rocket science to figure out what will happen. The nation would lose its glory forged by centuries of hard working scientists and engineers, domestic or foreign, who brought innovation and technology to keep the nation standing high in industry, education and economy among the world. At that time, you won't even be able to attract talent people to come here anymore because other nations do better.\n\nThen, some complains that government and companies are trying to lower the wage and get more tax because foreign students are willing to get paid less and taxed more just to stay in U.S. Believe me, they can do this in so many much clever ways that you won't even notice how they did it. Besides, foreign STEM students are paid similar compare to citizens, companies are not trying to lower the wage, in contrary, they are trying to increase it to attract more talent people. They do get taxed more and are willing to be exploited as a premium just to stay here and satisfy some ignorant complains like those all the time. Foreign students work harder, pay more tax, lay low in society, do no crime and yet some people still think they should leave? It is really a joke. Then nation has many other major problems to fix and this is definitely not among them. It should be promoted instead of being blamed.\n\nAt last, think it logically instead of emotionally. 12 month OPT is barely enough for any student to find a meaningful job and express their talent for the benefits of the society. If there is no extension, what you are doing is basically educate a group of smart and hard working students and then send them away.

Every year a lot of international students choose to come to the U.S. to study and pay for expensive tuitions and fees. One of the reasons these international students choose the U.S. is that the STEM OPT extension is a good opportunity for them to gain some industry experience. Without extension, the OPT will only be good for one year. It will be less attractive for international students to come to the U.S. to study without the extension. Countries such as United Kingdom, Australia, etc. are instituting similar new strategies to attract international students. In such competitive situation, STEM OPT extension is necessary to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. \nSecond, international students have been stimulating U.S. economy through paying expensive tuitions and fees and other living expenditures. In addition, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation and provision of knowledge and skills that help U.S. economy to grow. As an international student, I paid at least $50,000 a year in the U.S. to study and live. International students like me in the U.S. contributed 26.8 billion dollars to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. The successful adoption of STEM OPT extension by legislation will help to make this number grow year after year. \nAs an graduated international student who is working in IT industry, I think 3 years OPT is necessary because the first two years I am basically studying from work and not really contributing what I learned in school. The third year is when to reap from the time I spent in studying the subject knowledge. Without STEM OPT extension, I might have to go home after 1 year. My employer will be hurt in this situation because the time and money they spent on training me cannot be recovered. \nTo conclude, I believe STEM OPT extension is necessary to keep U.S. economy healthy.

If there is no such extension, the US universities will become much less attractive because students, especially the ones that pursuing the advanced degrees, will obtain much less experience from the course of study. Indeed, almost all of my friends choosing to come to US instead of going to UK or other European countries to pursue their advanced degree are due to the fact that the US can provide much better training opportunities than other countries. The results are obvious, if there were no such OPT extension program, there will be a huge lack of capable PhD students in the US universities and the basic research activities in the universities will be greatly and negatively impacted.\n\nAs to the lack of US citizens in the population of PhD students, it is not because the US universities do not want to enroll US persons as PhD students; it is just due to the fact that there is not enough number of US persons to apply to the PhD program. Every year my professor wants to hire several US persons as PhD students in our research group but often, it turns out that there are no US citizens in his class. Since all the PhD students are paid equally according to the universities' policy, there is no salary competition from the foreign students. In fact, professors are more likely to hire US citizens as PhD students because they can also work on the restricted projects.\n\nIn summary, if there were no OPT extension, the number of foreign students would be greatly reduced, and the working forces in the area of basic research in the universities would inevitably shrink.

And today I just read some comments which declared that the international students are getting all the jobs in the STEM area, and the citizens cannot get any more jobs. Thus the government should prefer citizens and give them more chances to get those jobs, thus should stop the OPT extension policy and get rid of these international students by stopping the OPT policy. This is extremely ridiculous and I have to say a few words to criticize it:\n\n1) The fact that the STEM companies are hiring international students is that they are indeed better students who know the techniques better! The company has the aim to make great products and serve the customers better, thus they want to recruit the best people. I don't believe that the companies would be happy to see the lack of good students (no matter what their nationality is). It is only when the companies find the good people can they make more contributions to the community, society and the country. \n\n2) The fact that so many good international students exist here will push the citizen students to study harder and gain better skills and knowledge. You can never deny the fact that it is the communication of people with diverse background that make innovations and push the envelope of technology. Think of how Greece can develop such great technology, math, political and psychology knowledge in the early days. It is because they embrace diversity and go over places in Europe to learn different knowledge, and then construct innovative ideas. \n\n3) If by the end of the day, the US has made the mind to stop OPT and get rid of the creative STEM students, they don't have anywhere to go but to work for other counties. It will be a disaster for the US to lose so many brilliant students and instead, send them to the competing countries (say China, India and Russia). Indeed they are very good workers, and they would contribute the same amount in the other countries, subtraction in the US side and addition to the opponents. It wouldn't be wise to do so. And I believe that everyone believes the established fact that in the 21st century, the country which gains the high ground of STEM will lead the world.  \n    \nIn a word, I believe that the US should work so hard trying to keep the good students in the US after their graduation and try to make them contribute to the country and society as much, instead of driving them away. It wouldn't be wise for the country to do so from any kind of perspective. All in all, I am supportive for the OPT extension policy.

USA is innovation driven economy, we are looking for the smartest and most qualified people to keep up with the rest of the world. It is asinine to think that a tech company would go for a cheaper resource (few grands) while compromising on the quality. That simply does not happen. I have personally been involved in recruitment process of many new hires, and hiring STEM workers is generally considered a risk since they cannot commit long term and typical projects last a couple of years. Nobody wants to train these people and let them go, so would rather hire an equally qualified US citizen. \n\nThese opponents of the proposed rule, fail to understand that deporting STEM workers is not going to help the economy rather it will lead to more outsourcing of jobs since all these qualified people will be available at a different location and at much lower cost. In addition to that, many new start ups will mushroom from these developing economies to compete with ours. This is already happening in India, China etc. Keeping highly skilled people here will lead to growth of companies and hence job creation. \n\nThe popular discussions on issues surrounding international students focus on whether or not to increase the H1-B quotas, or the misinformed notion that adding internationals to the US workforce lowers the salaries of US-born workers. Such individuals chose to ignore the research showing that actually it is the adding of foreign/remote workers, via outsourcing, is a truer cause of the downward pressure on US salaries. However, very little is discussed of their contributions to the US economy during their time of study and optional practical training. \n\nNational Economic Benefit\nSince 2004 the number of international students studying in the United States has grown at an annual rate of 4.5%. In 2014 a total of 886,052 international students (4% of total US higher education population) were studying in the US, an increase of 55% since 2004. During the period studied (2004-14), the largest year-over-year (YoY) increase in international students in the US occurred in the 2013-14 period of 8.1%.\n\nWith this growth in numbers comes an increase in economic activity.  Since 2004, the net contribution to the US economy and the number of jobs created/supported by international students and their families has been trending upwards.  In 2014, these figures stood at $26.8B and 340,000 respectively.  This was an increase of 108% for net contributions over 2004 figures. \n\nThe YoY net economic contribution in 2013-14 was 11.7%, while the 10 year CAGR was 7.6%. Just prior to the full onset of the recent housing-led financial crisis and a general reduction in economic activity, the net contributions by international students had its largest YoY increase of 16.1% in 2006-07. This then dropped to 7.2% in the following 2007-08 period, and has since been averaging 9.5% \n\nIn the period examined and prior to the recent financial crisis, contribution from living expenses to the US economy was greater than the contribution from tuition and fees.  However, this trend was reversed in the wake of the crisis beginning from 2009 . Tuition and fees contributions grew by more than twice the amount of living expenses on a compounded basis.  This can partially be attributed to the rising costs of tuition and fees charged by colleges and universities and the slower increases in housing costs (which make up the greater portion of living expenses). The rising rate of tuition and fees started outpacing that of living expenses before the financial crisis.  Housing costs from the housing-led financial crisis which proved less sticky than tuition and fees, served only to quicken the growth rate of tuition and fees relative to living expenses.  \n\nWhile economic activity from international students continues to grow, the growth rate of this contribution to the total net economic contribution to the US has been steadily declining since 2007 - around the time of the financial crisis. This declining contribution to the net total for the US economy, comes from declining growth rates in both contributions from tuition and fees and from living expenses. This implies that while students continue to choose US as their study destination, they are doing so at a much slower rate than before.  \n\nLets not be arrogant and forget how we got here in the first place. We were all immigrants with great ideas and now we have the luxury to pick and choose from these highly qualified individuals. Illegal immigration is a completely different story though. \n\nSuch initiatives are much closer to the spirit of this nation than the are credited for. \n\nThanks. \nDavid Wilson", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by David Wilson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5731", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I Strongly recommend the proposed rule of stem extension from 17 months to 24 months.

As time going, it will lead to a week competition of US companies in global market, end up with a slower growing up. In the other side, if international students do know it is almost hard to have work chances for more than one year in US, many students may choose not to study in US, rather choosing other North American countries or European countries, which is also will give out a bad affect to US. I am a student of a Master program in Computer science, I can see that more and more international students are thinking out going back to their country right after their graduation because of the no extension policies.

It would be a fair chance for these students to gain some US based work experience and understand the work culture which might be different in their home country. It could also help the student to get some more time to pay off their student loans.\nBut if the OPT period is reduced, it could have a negative effect on US economy and educational institutions as it puts in doubt the prospective students who are planning to come to the US to pursue higher education since they might end up taking loans to pay their high tuition fees, but they might not have the fair chance of paying off their loans. It puts them in a lot of debt at an early age and it would be very hard for them and even to their families back home to cope up with this kind of burden.\nAlso, there are many students who have come to the US in the past couple of years with the promise of OPT period of 29 months, and it is kind of an injustice for them if it is suddenly reduced to 12 months. It affects their planning and career and puts them in jeopardy.\nIt is also a huge loss to many of the corporate companies who have employed students on OPT and if they would have to let go of them suddenly, it would be a big negative impact to them as they would miss the qualified employees who are part of some of the big projects on their team. So, in this case, it would be a loss to both the students and the US economy.\n\nHence, I am strongly in favor of this rule which would not only help the students, but also be a massive help to the US economy and educational institutions who want these students to be a part of their research programs. This would also benefit the whole-world as many of these students have made enormous contributions in the research and invention of new ideas in all kinds of fields, which benefited the world in many different ways.\n\nThanks,\nSachin", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sachin Ramesh", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10202", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "When companies can legally discriminate on the nationality of job seekers, I hope the United States can make a little step to improve.

For any position, the privilege always goes to US candidates, as there are much more time and money to spend on hiring a foreign employee than a US citizen (all sorts of fees and processes).  I cannot emphasis this any more, as I faced these situations numerous times when i was looking for a job.\n3. Two years of OPT extension is not a permanent work visa. There are only limited spots for work visa every year. Employers would not want to hire a person who can only work for 2 years and has unknown future afterwards, unless they cannot find any suitable US candidates.\n\nIn conclusion, American workers have much more advantage over foreign workers if they are competing for the same position. This program is aimed at filling in the gap of supply for advanced degree positions. The conflict of interest here between American workers and foreign workers are small.\n\nAn addition comment to some people who are saying foreign workers are bringing down salary rates: Foreign workers cannot bring salary rates down. Instead, I know a lot of foreign workers, who work in corporate R&D positions, are earning high salaries. They get what they deserve and it is now way past the era where foreign employees would sacrifice their earnings just to stay in the states.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by yida  yang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20976", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The trained international graduates in the United States are making big contributions to the economy.

During  my career in the market place I saw, met and/or worked directly with foreign born engineers (and some times under such supervisors) that had been educated in their home country and/or in  the USA.  Many claimed PHDs who only had the equivalent of an American technical school education (if even that --- checking on resumes was weak to non-existent, and many claimed their records were losdt in the war or behind the Iron curtain). Vvoice and written communications were very often a problem most never overcame.  In fact, some close such friends confided in me that they were advised to maintain their thick accents because it helped enabled them to obtain much higher saleraries than they otherwise could.  Also, in many technical presentations I found most of them dropped back to a far loweer quality of English than they were capable of to elude being trapped in by a technical error that they had made. Another set of tricks they used was to drop definite and indefinite articles and the use of improper verbs, until their audience coujld not understand what they were saying, and they subject would be dropped.  Those of us that spoke English had no such smoke screen to hide under.  If we made an error  in speech or in writing we either corrected it immediately or were detected as being wrong or fraudulent. Many of them were raised or brought up in environments where the adage \"honesty is a virtue that only the rich can afford\" was a simple fact of life.  So one should expect many such people to be fraudulent.  But we need to screen them to assure we detect and block the entry of such people by very tight screening and verifying credentials.  \nFurthermore,  we have almost always had plenty of qualified American citizens with adequate technical training for any project I was aware of.  In fact there were usually more  qualifiede people than there were challenging jobs. Today the situation is even worse.  Far more people are going to college than ever before as a percentage and in numbers.  Competition is fierce.  Therefore, to bring in foreign workers and give them training so they can take jobs or classroom seats away from american citizens (whose parents taxes built the schools) just so businesses can hire many or all those foreign workers at far lower costs for a fews years or indefinitely, is just plain wrong and a form of treason, and it is the duty of our government to see to it that such a crime is not perpetrated against any of our citizens as a result of negligence or willful design.  Either is criminal.      \n\n              ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Robert Stokely", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4256", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nFirst let me remark that I am surely not an opponent of any and all immigration, in fact my mother is a naturalized US citizen and my wife is a Green Card holder. Nonetheless, I am quite convinced that the proclaimed \"shortage\" of qualified STEM workers in the US labor force is either confined to certain geographical regions, or else entirely bogus. The academic arguments on this issue are mixed and contentious, but also, well known, so I will not recapitulate them here. Instead, as an American citizen STEM worker I would like to discuss how increased foreign competition for domestic STEM jobs has negatively impacted me.\n\nI graduated in 2014 with an M.S. in financial mathematics. Having had a software developer internship over the previous summer, a solid academic record (3.8/4.0 GPA), and under the assumption that there was indeed a shortage of qualified STEM applicants (particularly at the graduate level), I had not anticipated the great difficulties I would subsequently have in finding employment. Through a six-month course of sending out literally hundreds of applications (what was then my 9 AM - 7 PM job), I managed to obtain a mere seven phone interviews, only three of which led to-in person interviews. I should perhaps also mention that my applications targeted any and all opportunities for which I had even a modicum of the desired skill set--all across the country. Finally, after about seven months (entering into the ranks of the long-term unemployed) I was fortunate enough to have been offered an opportunity in one of the less populated states in New England (at a company with no history of H1b sponsorship). Just before I left my home state (where my wife still resides) I had a competing offer for a programming opportunity, paying a meager $15 per hour. \n\nPerhaps I should not look so bleakly upon receiving only seven requests for a phone interview during the first six months of my job search, perhaps my resumes and cover letters presented my abilities rather poorly. And yet during the sixth phone interview the caller (a manager in the relevant department and a foreign national) commented that he could find \"someone with a Master's in financial mathematics anywhere\", but he needed someone who could write well, and that's why he called me despite my limited experience. I looked on Linkedin later and found that the position had been filled by a foreign national who had a year of working experience back in China. Maybe a full year of experience launches one out of entry-level status in the eyes of employers, and hence I wasn't competing on the same plane as the successful applicant. Well, one of two in-person interviews I had in my home state was conducted by three foreign nationals. I didn't get the job of course. The successful candidate later spontaneously sent me a connection request on Linkedin (which I accepted). She was another Chinese national with a mere eight months of experience who was arguably otherwise less qualified than I was. Later looking up the company on myvisajobs.com, I found that they had applied for an H1b visa for this position seven months earlier, and that the entire team is comprised of visa holders.\n\nAlthough my present position forces me to live nearly 1000 miles away from my wife, I am nevertheless grateful to be employed. I do, however, retain a bitter taste in my mouth whenever I hear talk about a rampant shortage in the STEM labor force and the need to adjust immigration policies to accommodate this purported problem. From my own experience I have concluded that the H1b visa eliminates entry-level positions in the tech field (absolving employers of the need to train recent graduates--remember, I was applying for programming jobs as well), but also singles out the domestic STEM labor pool for a substantial increase in competition for opportunities. If my own story should not make a sufficient argument to support the former conclusion in particular, I could proffer account after account of similar difficulties my acquaintances have faced, specifically those aiming for positions in software engineering. \n\nEven with this brief account of my own difficulties, you can imagine my horror in hearing that DHS, an instrument of my very own government, wishes to sidestep restrictions on H1b caps, and flood the tech labor market further, by extending the eligible period for OPT to 36 months (long enough for an incumbent to make a meaningful contribution). As if American STEM workers had not already suffered a sufficient degree of wage stagnation or depreciation, as well as increased competition, now they can be sidestepped in favor of candidates who are not required the prevailing wage, and are even less likely to engage in competitive negotiation than H1b visa holders. Hence, I ask that the Department of Homeland Security secure the opportunities, wages and competitive leverage of American workers, by ceasing from carrying out this extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Larry Frye", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10316", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's hard to put into words the anger I feel concerning this ruling.

I will first address the benefits of having the OPT STEM program and then point out many flaws in criticisms against it.\n\nOPT STEM program creates job and value-add for U.S. economy. There are approximately 900,000 international students studying in the U.S., and they pump $27 billion into the U.S. economy each years, supporting 350,000 American jobs. It is not uncommon for an overseas family to spend $100,000 or more per year for their child's college tuition and living expenses in America. Many of these students are attracted to U.S. universities not only because of the high education quality but also the prospects of working for U.S. firms for some time to learn the valuable skills that will benefit their long-term career goals. One year of OPT is apparently not enough to cultivate any meaningful experiences, especially for STEM fields whose research projects usually last for years. Not having the STEM option will make the whole U.S. education experience less attractive compared to other U.S. competitors who are aggressively attracting foreign talents such as Singapore, Germany, U.K. etc,...\n\nThe most important contribution of STEM students though are the new products and businesses they create after joining the workforce. According to a report by The New American Economy, 40% of the largest U.S. firms were founded by immigrants or first-generation immigrants, including many hottest tech startups. For example, Whatsapp, which sold to Facebook for $19 billion, was founded by a Ukrainian immigrant. In Silicon Valley, 50 percent of the tech companies, from Google to eBay, have an immigrant founder. 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child or an immigrant. For every 100 international STEM students who remain in the U.S. after graduation, 262 American jobs are created. \n\nCritics of the STEM OPT program have argued that STEM graduates accept lower pay, steal job and that there is no lack of demand for STEM workers. These claims are extremely ill-informed. First foreign STEM graduates usually work for high-tech firms and require much higher pay, especially those with Ph.D. degress. Second, there is higher risk to hire foreign STEM students and therefore the standards imposed on them are also higher. If they manage to get the jobs, you can't say that the jobs are stolen. The proposed rule also makes it clear that measures will be implements to ensure no lay-offs of American workers as a result of hiring foreign STEM graduates. Third, there is a lack of STEM talents in the U.S., period.  \n\nI would suggest that ICEB provides guidance regarding the cases of already-approved EAD's and strongly urge that it honors its commitments to these cases.\n\nReference:\nhttp://www.governing.com/gov-institute/voices/col-entrepreneurial-immigrants-international-students-community-development.html\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous (V.

Well, they only see the shallow aspect of things and don't have a long term view and consider the impact for the whole country. The fact is that foreign students learned high-tech knowledge and skills in the U.S university and then they make contributions to this country. They have to overcome more difficulties including languages, networking and competing with local people to find a job.

Technology is the long term power of a country and without competing for talents this country will eventually fall behind.\n2. I was a TA once for the undergraduate students and I really feel worried about them. Their mathematical skills are terrible and the professor had to come out with simple questions in the final so that they can have a higher rate to pass. I'm wondering how this country will do if they only rely on americans. Of course there are talent americans but in general their mathematics basis are pretty weak. \n3. Without foreign talented workers, there will be more situations that many tech companies will outsource their work to other countries. That is even worse because workers in those countries will require less salary and also do a good job.

This proposal will benefit the United States.\n\nFirst, the U.S. universities will benefit because the extension of OPT will attracts more international students. In fact many foreign students choose U.S. universities to pursue a bachelor, master or doctor degree given offers from universities in UK, Canada and other countries. These students pay high tuition fees so they contribute to the revenue of universities much. In addition, they also flourish the local restaurants, apartment companies and shopping malls.\n\nSecond, the U.S. will benefit from the contributions they high-technique international employees make. These employees not only help U.S. become the strongest countries in the field of science and technology, but contribute the U.S. economy much. According to the Partnership For A New American Economy (chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf), immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010.\n\n\nBesides, I see there are many negative comments about this proposal, the main concerns are the lower wages of international employees, the fierce competition and less job opportunities for Americans. I would like to response some concerns:\n\n1. Lower wages. In fact this is a wrong preconception. Many international students earn much more than the minimal wage even during their internship. For example, my labmates interned in NEC lab and HP lab earn about $8,000 per month. In addition the salaries of many jobs in the engineering and science field are higher than the GDP per capita of U.S. For example the median wages of a computer programmer is $76,140 (http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/computer-programmer). Therefore, lower wages is never a reason for the unemployment of native Americans.\n\n2. Less positions for Americans. Taken into consideration the growing need for STEM students, the open positions is actually increasing for both non-US and US citizens. According to \"STEM: Good Jobs Now and for the Future\" (chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/stemfinalyjuly14_1.pdf), the STEM employment is expected to increase by 17.0% during 2008-2018. Which exceed the growing number of international STEM students. Some burgeoning sectors such as machine learning, computer vision and medical imaging even lack high technique employees.

Due to the abusive behaviors overseas (some even filed 7-8 petitions using different companies just to increase the chance of being picked in the lottery), the chance for a student with advanced degree in US has become notoriously low (probably only 20% for a bachelor degree, and 40% for MS degree or higher, and this is expected to be SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER in 2017 Fiscal year, if no actions taken to deal with these abusive behaviors of multiple petitions in the H1B lottery).\n\nThe fix to the H1b system is NECESSARY with no doubt! Unfortunately, there won't be any solution in a short term due to the notoriously known slow legislation in US. This new ruling is effective to provide students in US the fair right to work for US companies without any interruption in their practical training or worry about work authorization issue. The objection by most commenters should be towards the BROKEN H1b system- which has brought a lot of Indian \"technicians\" into US to consume the training resources in US before they can actually work competently and directly compete with graduates from US universities. Actually, students that have completed studies in US need to be protected rather than be blamed, to improve the quality of US productive power.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhi Meng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22375", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "International students are making contributions to our country.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nDHS is unconstitutionally giving foreign (illegal aliens) work that should go to American born students the Judicial System should arrest any and all members of the Federal government who are stealing funds from Social Security and Medicare to benefits foreigners.

Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. \n\nThese high-skilled international students have so many choices of where to study and where to work and devote. Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. Why US? A long term of OPT period which providing more practice time is one of the key factors. US will be much less attractive for international students if the OPT extension rule cannot stay intact. \n\nFor example, Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022.\n\nRejecting international students would gain US a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive highly educated brains to other countries. \n\nBesides, international students have historically made significant contributions to the economic of United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

The following are my main reasons.\n\n1. I am from China, but I did my undergraduate study in UK. Then I decided to go to the US for my graduate study because of its favorable policy towards foreign STEM students. This policy is the OPT extension. I believe that a large amount of foreign students choose to study in the US just because of this policy. Without this policy, the US will lose these talents. \n\n2. America is No.1, it is true. This is not because it wins the World series every year, but because there are so many talented people live in this great country. They work together under its great social system, law system. They work together to make this country even more advanced. I know a friend, who is also from China. He is very talented in computer science. During his opt extension, he was employed by a company. He helped the company solve an long-pending problem and add 1 million dollars to its revenue. He told me that thanks to the long extension, otherwise he could not have enough time to focus on this problem. \n\nSome people may argue that this proposal may undermine the opportunities for native Americans. I don't think so. This is because most of foreign STEM students are competing for positions requiring advanced skills, which represent America's world competition ability in the world. Moreover, it will also bring more job opportunities for Americans. I know another friend, who after getting the H1b visa, he decided to start an company. This company attracted investment from venture capitals. His company employed about 10 native Americans!

Especially there is an increasing number of students dedicate to STEM majors to develop the technology to this country. As an recent engineering graduate, I still remember that America was my last choice when four years ago I decided to study abroad. One of the keys brought me to America was that I learned about the opportunity of getting industrial experiences after graduated that I can have in America but not in the European countries. Since I am one of the international students, I assume a lot of other international students have the similar thoughts. If this action to STEM OPT extension was not approved at last, I believe the amount of international students will decrease. According to the development strategies of my college to attract more and more international students, and thousands of new international students under F-1 visa every year, I think an decreasing number of international students is not what most colleges would like to see.\nSecondly, from what I know, a certain amount of programs prefer to have their employees to work over one year. No matter the reason is the cost of training new employees is not cheap, or the specific feature of the programs, regular 12-month OPT usually is not enough. Sometimes, the OPT limitation become the barrier for international students to get in those programs. Personally, my current employer wishes that I could stay for another years due to the release and the maintenance of the new product. However, without the extension I might have to go back to my country after my regular OPT. I am grateful that my employer took the investment of hiring me to create more value to the company, so I hope I could do as much as I can before I go back to my country. At that time, for me, I also could bring back more abroad industrial experiences, which allows allows me become more competitive to have a decent job back to my home country.\nThird but not the last, obviously international students formed a significant group of people that contributes both the economy and education industries by paying tuitions and living costs. Regarding to the economic structure of the area to my college, there are a lot of Asian restaurants and living supports around this area. There are even communities are mostly full filled by international students. With no doubt, international students have become an essential part of economy of the society. \nSome people would say international students who use OPT holding F-1 visa deprive the job opportunities from the local people. I would rather to say that companies always hire the candidates who fit the positions more with better knowledges and stronger skills to develop and create for companies. It is not the group of international students who take the opportunities; it is the group of more educated and skillful people who grab the chances. Besides, competitions to the job opportunities help to improve the technology and other aspects of the society. \nTo violently and extremely expel international students is not the solution to increase the employment rate for the locals. However, to embrace internationals who contain the quality of creating value to the United States is the advantage to the whole society and the country.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jean Feng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22157", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "First an the most important, OPT extension does not take the citizen's jobs.

I believe the proposed rule is beneficial to both the country and foreign students because of the following reasons. \n1. It attracts more talented international students to pursue academic degrees in higher education institutions in the United States.  With more top international students, not only will the universities have more diversified environment, more tuition income, but also more talents to contribute in the academic studies so that the universities in the United States can stay highly competitive in academic frontiers among the world.\n2. The 24-month extension of OPT helps the high technology companies keep talented people and boost the economy in the country. The STEM fields include mathematics, science, engineering, and computer information which are the most important fields in all high technology industries. Companies in such industries are one of the major contributors in the economy. With longer extension the companies can get more talented people and have them contribute with a longer time, which helps boost the economy. Imagine the talented international scientists and engineers in the high technology industries all choose other countries to study, work, and live over United States, what will it look like for the economy of country?\n3. The proposed rule also benefit the students. It helps international students to get more practical training opportunities in the country. The students can also make more contributions to the country after they study and graduate from universities. It's a win-win situation. Singapore government offers scholarships to attract talented international students to study there as long as they are willing to work in Singapore for 5 years after graduation. Giving more opportunities to international students will benefit the country because they can apply what they learn and contribute to the country.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dongyan Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15250", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree with the new extension rule!\n\nThe United States of America is the country of immigrants.

And after he finds a job, it takes about 3 months to be familiar with the work environment and the companies' technology. After that, he can begin to perform his skill to the companies, for example, for a math student, he could begin to build models or research tools, it should takes about 1 year to establish the tool as a product for his companies; after that, it usually takes a year to improve and maintain this product and the it can be used to make money. Last, if he cannot get his work visa at the end of the third year, it should take a few month to document his work and train another worker to take over it. \n\nTherefore, the time line is about: 3 to 6+3+12+12+3=36 to 39 months, 12 OPT and 24 months extension perfect fit this.

I think this should be increased to 36 months instead of 24. Given the appalling state of the work permit process; this would greatly help students in STEM, the US Companies employing them and the US economy. After all, a majority of patents and publications come from international students. \n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] The proposed rule by DHS requires students and employers to implement a formal Mentoring and Training Plan that would be submitted to the Designated School Official (DSO) before the OPT STEM Extension is granted. Further, every six months, the student is required to provide the DSO with an evaluation of his or her progress towards the training goals agreed upon. While this requirement is made in good faith, I note that there could be several reasons due to which the training goals might change. For example, the employing company might stop working on a project that was expected to increase the participating students STEM skills, and instead, request him or her to work on different project of similar nature. Therefore, the Mentoring and Training Plan must not require the student and employer to be overly specific regarding the training goals, and how progress towards them would be measured, because the projects and opportunities provided to the student might evolve or change with time.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] I support the proposal by DHS to include the 2008 Interim Final Rules (73 FR 18944) Cap-Gap provision, under which the DHS would temporarily extend an F-1 students duration of status and any current employment authorization if the student is a beneficiary of a timely filed H1-B petition and requests a change of status.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B] I believe the transitional measure should be extended to all STEM students whose current STEM Extension is set to expire close to the vacatur date of Feb 12, 2016. This can be done by allowing those who are in grace period after the current STEM extension ends to request for extension of the remaining 7 months for a total of 24 months or the remaining 19 for the total of 36 months. This would greatly help the students, the US companies employing them and the economy! \n.\n\nTo summarize, I strongly support this proposed regulation, and hope that it will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register in a timely manner, without incorporating significant changes. I note that if the final rule does not take effect before the date of vacatur of the current 17-month OPT STEM Extension, up to 34,000 students who are currently taking advantage of this provision will be forced to resign from the current employment and depart the United States. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Manny Ramaswamy, Ford Motor Company", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0688", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Well, here we go again!

Local STEM student are doing well and they usually get ideal employment easily, still they alone simply can't satisfy the appetite of a fast-growing high-tech industry, where international STEM students make great contribution.

Enormous well trained US citizen are struggling to find a job. Top 500 fortune companies confused government to replace F-1 foreigners over US citizens for inhumanity reason, like reduce labor cost, lower salary for same position, squeezing F-1 employee's workforce.

No one can deny that technology is changing the world every day, this is not only because of intellegent people devoting themselves to career, but also the justifiable laws and policies allow them work with less concerns. working in a different country is always challenging, people have their rights to persue their dream and the lives they want to have. me, one of millions of international students, is hoping the freedom and equality can be taken seriously before making a decision. thank you.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qiuyu Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5989", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We do not need any more forgein workers in the usa", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Earl Krantz", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7466", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Its good to have time!!!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Thatwik Pasupuleti", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0548", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "International students are legal taxpayer and they make enormous contribution to the US.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Beth Black", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15916", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Dear DHS,\nBeing an Indian i would be expected to support the extension rule but as a human i think its not fair to pass this rule.

I do believe that we need a long term solution in terms of improving the primary education in the STEM fields in American schools and encouraging more students to study in STEM fields, but that is another matter altogether. \n\nSome of the most outstanding inventions and patents in my company have been made by foreign born employees who graduated from US Universities in STEM fields. It is inventions such as these that help companies achieve a competitive advantage in a globalized world. We should give such talented STEM employees a way to contribute more for American innovation.

I agree with this not just because I am an F-1 STEM student who will be affected by this, but also on the well-being and goodness of the US people and companies. \n\nA country can never be booming up in the economy as well controlling well on the CPI index to avoid the price going to high. But these years US government has done well in this. You may argue it is the result of the low interest rates. Come on, it is just a few years after the financial crisis, many firms got broke down. If you know the market well, the technology firms as well as the technology itself contribute a lot to the not only firm wide but also the country wide recovery of the economy. And a really important factor is the STEM extension after 2008 which allow more technology and science related students to have more time to chase their dreams as well as contributing to the US economy as well as the firms. So it will not be surprised that many tech firms including Facebook, Google and Airbnb, are still keeping expanding the number of the international employees even they are so big now. Beyond that, for many firms other than the tech field, they are quite eager to get the tech-background people to make the firm work more efficiently, for instance, the tech side in the finance world or other industries. Yeah, you got it. There are still a gap between the need of the tech guys and the supply of them in US, and the former group is much much larger than the latter in job market.\n\nMore specifically, the STEM extension will contribute to the firms in US or some international companies who have branches in US. And not surprisingly, the firm appreciates more than the employees like us. As I have many friends related to STEM background and as far as I know, for tech people, for no matter what industry, they are in need in each country. Even US would not give the opportunity for working, they can go to Europe or Asia to find a successful localized company to know more and contribute more. Also, if the STEM extension will not be passed, there will be less people going to US to chase expensive education in STEM. All these factors will definitely hurt the tech firms or the firms who have tech positions.\n\nSo from the well being and benefits of both the US economy and the STEM related students, I really agree and urge the STEM extension will be confirmed as soon as possible.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Enze Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2692", "postedDate": "2015-10-29T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am supportive of the 24 months OPT extension because, more than any other country, The US has to retain Technical talent within the country.

If the extension of OPT for STEM students cannot be approved, the downside is that a lot of US firms will be significantly affected. They couldn't find the right people to take over the job left by the employees with F1 VISA immediately. Meanwhile, they spent tons of money on training the F1 students and shaping them into the way they wanted. These employee s with a lot of profession skills were able to take over any challenging job and just started to earn money for their companies. However, guess what? They have to leave their job one year later due to no extension to the OPT. The firms will have to recruit a new employee and spend money on training them again. Think about it.

However, the fact is that US have a huge need for the STEM students. The prime career choice for the majority of the Americans is lawyer, doctor, finance, or accounting. The proportion of pursuing a STEM degree is relatively low. That's why President Obama appealed to the US kids to study in the STEM. It was known that the US economy is getting better and recovering.

The reasons are as follows:\n1. STEM F1 students, most with either a master or Ph.D. degree, contribute a great deal to the U.S. economy, especially in IT, micro electronics, bio-engineering etc. These students came to the U.S. with an \"American Dream\", they serve their company faithfully, take care of their family and the community, as well as pay taxes to repay the society and nation. They are also the population that has the lowest crime rate. Cutting the opportunity for OPT extension will result in millions of F1 graduates losing their jobs immediately and deported out of the country. This not only poses a negative sign on U.S. policy towards new high-tech immigrations, but also undermines U.S. high-tech industry tremendously. \n2. If we look back at the initiative of why opt stem extension came into being in the first place, we could see that it is because the STEM majors are the ones that are perceived as least attractive, time consuming, labor intensive, and painstaking jobs. Even if we cut off F1 graduates and leave all these job vacancies to U.S. citizens, there will still be a gap between the need and supply in the labor market---there might just not enough citizen labor that are attracted to these jobs. If one U.S. citizen and a F1 student with equivalent capacity in the job are interviewed by employer, it is very unlikely that the employer would bias towards the F1 student---they have to pay extra for application of H1 visa. On the other hand, if we bias towards U.S. citizens, without enough STEM-enthusiastic U.S.citizens to fill in the gap, the high-tech industry will be harmed due to insufficient labor resource.\n3. The cancellation of this opportunity will also has an impact on prospective F1 student's perception of U.S. immigration policy. Learning the fact that there will be much less chance to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation, prospective F1 students may decide not to go to U.S. after weighing. This inevitably imposes a potential loss to the education system in U.S., which are open to international students more and more in recent years. With intuition increasing every year, losing the international market will pose a pressure on Universities and colleges.\nI believe that as every act has its two sides, the current opportunity for f1 students to get extra 24 months of training (extension of OPT) can do more good than harm in both the short term and long term run.

Another fact is, international student only occupied a small proportion of the job market.\n\n2. International students are not taking away job opportunities from Americans. Actually, by their hard working and intelligence, they are helping their employers to defend competitor overseas and contributing to the booming of American's economy. This, in return, would attract more and more talent students to work in the States and create more and more job positions. I think this is also the key factor that United Stated is the leading country in many technical and scientific domains.\n\n3. Last but not at least. International students are not spending their salary in their original country. They work here, and buy things here, which would be also benefits to the community.

I have nothing against  OPT/H1B visas but DHS should check the misuse of OPT visas and H1B visas done by the consultancies/employers.\n\nMassive visa fraud is happening in the broad day light done by Indian consultancies. These so called Indian employers fake their resume and select candidates who are in OPT claiming that they have H1B visa. They run fake pay rolls and hire mostly Indian grads from US universities who can't even speak proper English. These so called consultancies get projects from companies(subcontracted by them)  by showing  that they have a very strong experienced workforce with 5-10 years experience. Most of the interviews with contractors are done through Skype and questions are answered by an experienced guy who will be on loudspeaker during the interview. While the actual candidate will lip sync to proxy candidate's reply to interviewers questions. Companies have hired thousands of fake candidates like this and some of them got fired. Consultancies/employers will lose that job contract as a result of this. But they will continue doing this as a candidate with US degree is their cash cow. These companies won't do background check properly and a person with a fake profile joins them. Within a span of 1 month they will be caught and kicked out. Some lucky ones stay there with the help of skilled proxies. These fake candidates will share their laptop screens with proxy worker sitting in India and get this work done. There are lots of fraudulent practices happening without the notice of officials and the industry.\n\nRecent examples are raids conducted by DHS on couple of Indan IT consultancy firms based in California and New Jersey. They arrested some Indian entrepreneurs who ran fake pay roll and employed candidates with fake experience.  If you check the number of H1B visa applications you will realize the shocking number of applications that were duplicated by these con men. \n\nWithin a year, the H1B applications will overflow to  300,000 numbers because most of these consultancies will put 3-4 applications to get their H1B selected. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and other companies that apply for more than thousands of H1 visa applications should be investigated as such companies employ less than 30 percent American citizens. \n\nAs an American citizen, I am fed up of these consultancies and fake candidates.   Because of their fraudulent activities many companies don't trust Indian graduates. It's become a stereotype that an Indian students always cheats in exams, fakes their resume and get jobs which should be given to genuinely experienced candidates.\n\n This brain drain concept  is completely ridiculous. I don't believe that USA as a great country needs foreign graduates to save economy or future of this country.  Most of the foreign students especially Indian  and chinese are here to make money and they don't come here to create jobs or create intelligent kids to save United States. It's a shame that United States as a great country can't control such frauds from taking advantage of this system. Please do a thorough investigation on such people and make OPT rules strict to prevent such malpractices by consultancies. \n\nIt is also important to save American jobs for American people. I would like to recommend that any employer should call foreign graduates only after they have interviewed a specific number of American candidates to make sure that the priority is  given to American citizens.  Please do the needful to stop these fraud Indian consultancies. Rather than giving OPT visas to all students who graduate here in USA, you should implement a system where  students with good academic credentials directly benefit from  system. Those who fake their credentials should be punished by cancelling the OPT and deporting them back to where they came from. \n\nPlease strictly enforce OPT visa holders to work in their corresponding fields they have their degrees based on. Recently, I have noticed that many of the mechanical engineering grads started working with these IT consultancies with fake profile and fake experience. Please take necessary steps to avoid such issues in future. Please stop them from changing companies during the OPT period. This will make sure that those who fake resumes to join a company will pay the price eventually. Stop graduates working with fake experience and taking away American jobs!! \n\n\nTo avoid faking resumes and profiles by these con artists, I hereby request  DHS to enforce background check rules on these candidates before they even start their jobs. If you don't take care of concerns raised by American workers like me eventually this rule will be thrown out by another judge in the court. So I hope you'll address my concerns to implement a strong rule to avoid such fraudulent activities by foreign graduates and Indian consultancies. \n\n\nGod Bless United States of America!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Thomas Hayden", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1549", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This rule is a complete farce and waste of tax payer money.

The biography of Tsien Hsue-Shen ``Thread Of The Silkworm'' by Iris Chang describes very well how the US has made a wrong decision by driving Tsien, one who once contributed to the US Space Race, back to China, after an internment for 5 years. Trien get so disappointed with the US, turned the disappointment to a fighting spirit and pioneered China's space program. The US gave China a chance to shorten the technology gap. It takes talented minds to preserve US's overall superiority in science, technology and engineering. The best way to get those talented minds is not to ``capture'' them from foreign research institutions, but rather build the platform to let those alines survive and thrive, let the platform attract them (while placing a watchful eye and a glass ceiling on them, let them make contributions but not usurp the supremacy of the mainstream group.) Driving them away may protect some local jobs but will cost the chance to obtain those top minds.\n\nOn an individual point of view, I as a foreigner know so well that I'm given a chance to stay temporarily (OPT is a temporary status) because I am being useful to this country. I am not just one who fills a job, I'm a taxpayer as well. The tax I pay can be used to fund another American student's graduate study or build another super-carrier, and that's why I'm deemed useful. A society with a complete welfare program would probably give some grace to the weak and the homeless, but I as an alien will have no such second chance, therefore my whole existence here depends on me being useful to the US.\n\nFrom the policy maker's point of view thousands of aliens aggregated together speaks louder than the anecdotes of individuals who tell miserable stories about losing their own jobs. The truth is when people are given incentive (chance of getting a job here) and are given the aforementioned insecurity and pressure, they would probably do better at mind-bending and tedious jobs like grinding computer programs -- the category most OPT jobs fall in -- and surviving the pressure, and emerging stronger and more resilient. Perhaps the pressure and insecurity is a kind of ``luxury'' enjoyed only by aliens because they are forced to fight their way through, much less enjoyed by some citizens who are shielded by protective greenhouses. The US is leading the world which means its citizens will compete with the most elite people in the world sooner or later; even stopping the proposal could not reverse that.

Secondly, I do not think 17 months would be enough for a student to turn out as a valuable professional for the society and definitely need some more time to continue their practical work and apply their talent in developing America.

And that's what high-technology industry urgently needs in the States. This trend keeps going up nowadays. I found most of the negative voice ridiculously funny 'cause they think Americans can't find jobs because foreigners are cheap. Funny, right? Foreigner students are not cheap at all. Salary is based on your ability. Today we are not talking about illegal immigrants, we are talking about talents. Believe me companies wouldn't hire employee with poor ability just because they are \"cheap\". Neither of international or American students are superior to the other. Whoever has the needed talents can realize their value. If you can't find a job, don't think all Americans have no job. Even without international intelligent students, you still can't compete with other Americans. Why not just face the fact that your are just not qualified and find reasons in yourselves? If OPT stops, development stagnates, government stressed. What you should stop is blaming own faults on other policy bringing progress.\n\n2 Education: Have you ever considered how stopping OPT extension is gonna harm the country? Besides development stagnates, Students are not willing to study in the States. This harms our all-time honorable reputation of education that we are proud of. The intelligent won't come, and those who object OPT today think they can get paid without working hard as a result of lacking competence.

This whole tuition burden thing is even more for the International students. The only reason that so many of them are still willing to pay the high price and get educated in the U.S. is because they not only get a degree here, they also get the industrial experience and practical trainings through OPT, which enhance their job competencies and competitiveness in their home countries once they return. If we are no longer granting OPT extension to these students, obtaining higher education in the U.S. would all of a sudden become all of a sudden too much sunk cost, too little foreseeable return, and not so attractive to them. And the truth is, there are more than enough countries out there who are still looking to bring in talented foreign students to help conduct research in higher-ed institutions, work in and enhance the high-tech industry, and last but not least, bring a huge amount of income to just about every industrial sector. And shall the U.S. let go it's OPT extension attraction, countries like Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, even the European countries or Japan/Korea would act quickly and steal these productivity and income-generating talents with their own versions of OPT or other immigration benefits. What would the result be? U.S. universities looking at many empty seats in lecture halls; professors cannot find enough competent and hardworking students to help with research and TA works; shops around college campus taking hit for losing bit chunk of their business, I can go on for a long while.\n\nNow let's take a look at our companies. Both established companies and hot startups in the U.S. are looking to enter foreign markets nowadays, especially large markets like China and India (which also happen to be the two major sources of STEM students in U.S.). OPT extension in such cases will help these companies find and hire the best of foreign STEM talents, and not only use their technical competencies to the companies' product development and operations, but also take advantage of these students' rich understandings of their home market. Take Uber, Google, or Facebook, which are either fighting hard against local competitors or trying to enter long-banned markets. Having a good number of OPT-backed employees speaking on the companies' behalf should definitely help building on positive company reputations in front of local customers and even the governments.

To maintain US position as a leading innovation-driven economy in the 21st century, our employees must be equipped with the skills and experiences that will prepare them to be leaders in our countrys robust economy and diverse, complex society. Many of the worlds most innovative and valuable companies started and are located in USA.  At their core, these companies are world leaders due to their ability to harness science, technology, engineering and math to drive innovation.\n\nSimply put, our students are not graduating from public schools equipped and prepared to continue on to higher education STEM programs or to enter the STEM workforce. Currently, there are more job openings in STEM fields than qualified STEM job seekers. This gap must be closed if USA is to retain its position as a world leader in STEM innovation, particularly in light of estimates that project the number of STEM jobs to grow by 19 percent over the next decade, nearly twice the rate of non-STEM jobs.\n\nBut in contrast, our talents reserve is insufficient to satisfy such great demand and increase. The fact is we have dedicated to stressing our STEM education, but the achievement is still trivial. It is not just a simple problem to stress STEM education and cultivate more qualified American youngsters. American education system focus on creativity, problem-solving, logistic and critical thinking, which allows a great extend of flexibility and freedom. That's why we have the most top universities and the most talents output in the world. Currently, our education system is already mature and not necessary to emphasize STEM more. And we'd better not mimic Asian education with stressing memorization, test-taking in STEM subjects.\n\nIn my opinion, absorbing some STEM talents from overseas is the best way to keep such balance. Only competition could push our students forward. Indeed, it would reduce some opportunities for our own students; nonetheless comparing the the shortage of STEM talents, we'd better prepare more talents reserve. If we do not offer such STEM OPT extension for international graduates, we must accept that there will be numerous STEM talents educated by American institute going back to serve their own country. And then our talent loss would become increasingly severe. At that time, we cannot inverse the situation any more. We don't need to worry about increasing competition and compressing room for American students. Because no matter how many local talents reserve we have, it still cannot satisfy the great demand and future increase. And we should note a fact that, even though we allow more international employees serve in USA, the core population that manage those big firms are still our US citizens. Most of those international employees are just doing basic work at basic status. And there are a huge number of them just want to work several years and then go back their country. Most importantly, we never lose our core resources. We should consider more about filling the vacancy instead of self-protection.\n\nSelf-protection is non sense, the most stupid way to limit talents. Keep doing the American way, absorbing the most excellent talents and making them serve United States. \n\nGod bless United States!!!\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Stephen Iris", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21171", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM is the combination of majors which US need.

We employ a lot of computer science, statistics and mathematics in our daily jobs. Employees here hold various STEM degrees (from Bachelors to PhD) from prestigious institution including MIT, Harvard, etc... At the beginning of the year, some of my colleagues left the company that opened up entry-level positions for hiring. Because of the complications in H1-B visas, the clear priorities have been given to citizens and green-card holders. STEM-degree foreigners were usually put aside or required a much higher standard. The positions are left vacant until today, November 3, 2015 (more or less 8 months). The candidates we have interviewed really struggled during our technical rounds and hardly any passed the first round. We have eventually resorted to interviewing foreign STEM candidates and begun to find good fits for the positions but are still reluctant because of the current STEM / H1-B situations. \n\nThis personal anecdote is common for firms in my industry if you have time to chat with their HR's. Having read previous comments, I want to draw several points from the anecdote above:\n- Many are confusing STEM foreign graduates (masters, PhD, researchers with publications) with low-skilled cheap IT labors involved in recent H1-B scandals. The former are intelligent skilled talents that contribute ideas and can generate jobs for America. We pay these individuals well or else they can easily go to our competitors. \n- While there may be a good supply of local STEM workers (as we can still find local candidates), we are seeing shortage in the highly skilled talents (as we cannot find any to hire) that have our demanded qualifications. Again, we will not lower our bar just because of work authorization issues. This highlights another point: many previous comments rely on the fact that 430000 jobs being replaced by foreign-born STEM graduates. This is irrelevant. Based on the anecdote above, I would want a statistics on how many of these jobs can be filled by local STEM labors. This is the exact statistics that we care about.  \n- The tax issues really have second-order effects compared to the hassles that companies have to go through (lawyer fees, time and resources to search, HR...) to find and retain these talents. This should not pose any unfair biases. I don't think any STEM graduates will refuse to pay the 7% tax exempt on top of 35% if they are asked to either.\n \nIn conclusion, this is a good step that DHS is taking to retain foreign-born US-educated talents. I urge that this rule gets implemented and that we fix the H1-B system and impose stricter qualification requirements.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous (J.O.)", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5067", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "To better build a strong country, we need foreign students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cindy Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21265", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "To whom it may concern:\n\nI am in vehement opposition to the proposed rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.\n \nHowever, before the rule can go into effect, it must go through a public comment period. The Obama administration attempted to bypass the public process but a lawsuit on behalf of U.S. tech workers forced them to comply. Ian Smith explains why my comment is critical to stopping the rule:\n\n\"Because DHS must respond to each comment, they'll have to fully explain themselves and fix many of the problems raised. And the longer it takes for them to respond, the more likely they'll miss the court-appointed deadline.\"\n\nAbout this, I have been shocked to find out this, about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\n  OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. \nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n  The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. \n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n  The proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\" \n\nExcuse me, gentlemen, \"with all due respect,\": Where, then, is the regard for American-born workers and their needs.

You earn your position by building knowledge and skills, and the Americans already has an advantage over foreigners as English is their mother tongue.

As is known that US is the home for most elite IT companies and plays a leading role in technology innovation. As a OPT student, one will be able to work longer in the US and get better prepared for his/her career in his/her own country. Many students who plan to work in US for 2 or 3 years do not need to rely on H1B visa if they are able to work in OPT status for 3 years, and this will largely relieve the H1B visa tension. Since most of the students want to gain work experience and go back to their own country after 2 or 3 years, holding an H1B visa will be a waste because they will not use up the years. Thus, extending OPT rather than offering H1B is a better way to provide a legal work status for these students.\n\nSecond, the fast growing of IT industry is short of STEM talents, and will definitely be demanding more, especially talent new grads. OPT students have contributed a lot to the success of big IT companies, like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc, and these companies make a better life for us. Talents are the heart of these companies and the heart of future innovation, where US, as the world IT industry leader, definitely wants to play a big role. Extending OPT program will keep more talented and skilled foreign students working and contributing in US and secure the economic growth. \n\nThird, keeping OPT students will help create more job opportunities and improve the US job market. Some people argue that these students will take their jobs in the future, but this is not true. Actually, these OPT students will help expand the industry and thus creating more jobs. Look at those startups, a lot of them are created by foreign talented students or have these students working hard during their growth. Some of the startups will grow to giants and create tons of positions. This is very beneficial to US job market in the long term.

There is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\n\nThere is no training in this program.

U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary.  And by defining a recent college grad as a student, the DHS takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes (FICA and Medicare taxes) -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.  The OPT workers will cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nOPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.

For international students, certainly, OPT is a precious experience, for most of them will come back to their countries after finishing the study and internship in U.S. In addition, more and more international students now come to U.S. are capable enough to enroll in OPT, and they obey the rules in U.S., being one part of te society. How unfair it will be if STEM OPT for them would be shortened simply because of their nationalities but they have done nothing wrong.\n\nAlso, this proposal is equally beneficial for U.S. students. We all know that competition can turn out to be a positive catalyst for young people to learn and improve. Many international students can exactly be such catalyst. Students of excellent academic performance can gain such chances of OPT, so the competition should be fierce, but it is actually a push to U.S. students to be more hard-working. I don't mean that U.S. students are not diligent. But if our propsal allow them to have exceptional priviledge on OPT, they can choose to live with less efforts.\n\nThird, U.S. is famous for its inclusive nature, which attracts many international students to come and study. In these years many institutions have proposed objections toward international students, pointing out that they have taken up the resources which should be used by native students. Perhaps that's the reason why this proposal receives strong objections, but I believe we should not cut the rights of current international students. They are innocents. Many of them really appreciate the chance to come to U.S. It is unfair to blame them only because their number is too much, which should be controlled by people other than themselves!\n\nSincerely hope you can take these factors into consideration.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Laura Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20682", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a STEM international student.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors.

As soon as they graduate, most of the students prefer to work for the industry, where they get a chance to expose themselves to practical implementations of theoretical concepts. Industry needs talented people to work for them, and talent can easily be honed at Universities because of the academic ambience and the diversity it offers. Not all countries have the cutting edge infrastructure and technologies that US has. If international students do not get a chance to practice whatever they learnt in a School, I don't think they'll opt US as a destination for higher education.\n\n2. Industries in US work in close collaboration with Educational Institutes to develop cutting edge technologies, which is the future of US. Most of the international students will stop coming to US, if they do not find any prospects after higher education. In that case, innovation driven industry which works with the Educational Institutes will be short of talented pool. This will eventually affect US economy.

Since STEM students will contribute a lot of taxes after graduation. STEM students are most likely to join in technical industries and likely to have a relatively high wage (above average, due to market circumstances). Ensuring OPT extension for STEM students can be beneficial to the U.S. federal taxes. If OPT period is only 12 months the industries will unlikely to employ international students but if just select from citizens their pool of potential employee will reduce a lot. So it is more difficult for these large scale businesses (especially IT industries like Google and Facebook) to hire new employees. Moreover, lots of current employees in these companies are OPT or OPT extension students. If OPT extension is cancelled these people will be forced to leave but the transition and hiring will be a huge problem. That may cause enormous economic losses. Last, STEM OPT attracts more international students and they pay tuitions and living expenditures in the U.S, which stimulates the U.S. economy.\n\nAnd for the concerns that these STEM students grab work opportunities from U.S citizens, I don't think it is true. Since for most working opportunities no matter STEM or not citizens are first to be employed and last to be unemployed. Additionally, STEM opportunities have qualifications. In every society who meet these qualifications are more likely to be minorities. I don't think everyone can be qualified for these jobs if all STEM OPT students are forced to leave.

Spreading the whole country, F-1 nonimmigrant students dine at the local restaurants, entertain themselves at the local bars and cinemas, and shop at the malls, which give rise to an increase in the consumption and a growth of GPA in the United States. Simultaneously, a great portion of F-1 nonimmigrant students are highly intellectual and creative. Putting them in the labor market of the United States is a wise way to guarantee technology development in the United States.  If extension of training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students is not approved, a great number of them will not come to the United States for better education and therefore, the United States of America can no longer benefit from them.\n\nSome opponents argue that F-1 nonimmigrant students have an advantage over the US citizens in the job market in the sense that those employers prefer to recruit F-1 nonimmigrant students than US citizens. However, it doesnt make any sense since the e-verify program guarantees no discrimination between employees in terms of their race and nationality. Furthermore, the argument of the opponents claiming that a lower payment of opt students result in the preference of them among employers is also untenable, because all the interns have a lower payment than full-time applicants, regardless of their nationality. \n\nAs the third point, extending the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students and putting them in the job market in the United States is also an impetus for the US citizen candidates to improve their competency in the job market. With the competition from F-1 nonimmigrant students, native students are confronted with bigger pressure and a fiercer competition and they will work harder to make them distinguished in the job market, which also serves as a benefit for the United States.\n\nBased on the above reasons, I strongly hold the perspective to expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. In that scenario, there will be a win-win situation for both F-1 nonimmigrant students and the United States.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xuejun Zhao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11228", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Foreign students also are students of this world, they also may be the hope of this world.

He WAS an international student but thanks to his intelligence and hardworking he CO-FOUNDED Instagram, which almost every American citizen is using on a daily basis now to take advantage of what technology can bring to us. Not to even mention the job opportunities Instagram is creating for its own employees, a lot of U.S. businesses using Instagram as a platform to develop their business, and professionals in various industries. \n\nBut besides Instagram, there're many STEM international students working hard in silicon valley and all other places just to make better and cheaper technologies happen for every American citizen.\n\n2) Approval of STEM IS NOT placing international students over american citizens. As far as I know, hiring is based on applicants' competency and skill set for a position. This means if an american citizen and an international student have the same skill set and the same competence, they will be both considered for the position (despite the fact that american citizens are always preferred to international students). There's no way that international students are given advantages because apparently in most of the situations american citizens are always preferred by recruiters.\n\n3) STEM is about hiring the intelligent and competent but NOT cheap labor. Ask those silicon valley international students working hard for their employees, do they earn less than their american peers? For every race and nationality, I.T. is an industry that pays well. This is not based on their nationalities but on their competence.\n\n4) No STEM will lose U.S. educated intelligent professional to their home countries, mostly fast-growing developing countries, who can be much stronger rivals against U.S. and cause huge loss of jobs in the U.S. eventually. Imagine all those Google, Facebook, Apple international student engineers who work hard on driver-less automobiles, google fiber, and other technologies go back to their home countries, i.e. India, China, etc. They received top-notch U.S. education in tech, math, statistics, etc., and then they serve huge corporate in these fast-growing countries, Tata, Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Alibaba, etc. Just think WHAT WILL HAPPEN?? When these already strong rivals absorb all this intelligence from the U.S., they can rise up faster and stronger and finally beat the U.S. market and economy, which will lead to much less job opportunities in the U.S. eventually.\n\n5) Even with STEM, international students are already having a difficult time finding jobs. I graduated from a top tech university in the U.S. and noticed that all our American peers with the tech background had found big name jobs one semester before they graduated. On the contrary, our international students peers were challenged by culture barriers, language incompetency, and lots of I.T. employers being RELUCTANT to offer them sponsorship to work in the States. I don't believe it was ever a fair game for international students to find STEM jobs in the States, but that's fine because they're not citizens. However, depriving them of even the opportunity to look for a job in the States after they paid expensive tuition and became competent to make contribution to the U.S. is against what this great nation was founded upon.\n\nI believe this proposal will benefit the U.S. development and growth in the long term, and know that a lot of my American peers from the STEM background actually support this proposal since it will NOT affect their chance of finding a good job at all.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by June Xue", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12037", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "According to my own experience in STEM area, few Americans are working in these fields and internation students do a good job in related STEM projects. \n\nI think this police is very good for U.S. First, few Americans take STEM jobs which means foreigners wouldn't decrease the working opportunities for Americans in these fields.

Among all of the means of receiving H1-B Visa as well as gaining the \"Green Card\", working as a STEM student for a proper and reasonable times of years, and then applying for an working visa can only benefits the foreign STEM students, but also bring benefits and thousands of millions of fortunes and opportunities for the U.S. itself. \nParticularly, for the students' point of view, being able to work for more than1 year in the U.S. helps them gaining enough experiences for self-improving. On the other side, allowing students to work in the U.S. for  reasonable years and having more opportunities to applying for the H1B Visa benefit the on-going projects and companies eventually. For mostly of the projects in different industries, one projects normally last more than 2-3 years. Having only one-year's opportunity to work in this country leads to high student floating rate. Unstable teams could always lead to cooperation problems and schedule delayed, and the worst, financial overspending. \nAlso, let's focus our eyes on the daily life and normal people. If this proposal doesn't been approved, thousands of job opportunities would be affected. Since the advantage of studying in the U.S. was reduced along with the cancelation of STEM extension, the foreign students (especially STEM students) would spread to other countries all over the world, all student related business would be strike. For example, I live in Hoboken where the Stevens Institute of Tech. located in. Nearly 1/3 of the renting business was supported by us students who study abroad. Hoboken is just a small collage town with renting business as its top 3 businesses that keep the town run, but it also represents hundreds other similar towns all over the country.

They say that universities oversupply such grads, citing statistics showing that many computer science majors work in other occupations, for example. IN FACT, the skills of these graduates are highly valued beyond a narrow subset of occupations, further evidence of STEMs high demand. Indeed, computer science degree holders are commonly employed in managerial positions, business operations, engineering, and even as top executives  hardly evidence of a wasted education.' \n\nAll in all, OPT extension would bring out great benefits to U.S. I highly support this proposal.\n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shiwei Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18520", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is mutually beneficial for both US companies and international students to extend the OPT-extension period.

Three reasons are worthy of mentioning: 1. The U.S. should let the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can continously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. U.S. has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes the country strong annd thriving. The dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industries could not have been so prosperous, e.g. IT. The science and technology is the key to the further advancement of the U.S economy which benefits everyone of Americans. So in order for the future economy, we should allow those students holding F-1 visa stay longer.\n2. The diversity of the society is very important. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings. Diversity of cultures can also prevent biased or partial collective opionions and behaviors in this country.\n3. Some argue that those international students create intense competition for jobs in the U.S. In fact, this is a good thing in a long run. The competion can push the majority of our citizens to enhance and increase their skills and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. As we know, citizens already have a natural edge when competing with foreigners because they do not need sponsorship and they have language advantage. We should probably blame our elementary education in STEM instead of immigrants if our citizens still find it hard to land a job in STEM field with all these advantages! If we let the tremendous amount of skill-equipped human resources outflow from the U.S only because of weak competitive power of our citizens., then it will be an unestimated loss to our domestic companies and to the country as a whole. If our domestic companies are no longer able to compete with foreign companies hiring more talented workers who once studied in our country and eventually lose global market share, then our domestic industries will be severely impacted and unemployment rate of citizens will go even higher.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bixuan Liu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11631", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM Extension is one of the most importance reasons that U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally and stay attractive to outstanding foreign students.

Foreign student come to US for 2-year degree will contribute will contribute $200000.00 with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other cost. These money comes from the foreign students themselves not scholarship. Actually, scholarship for foreign students in 2-year degree is not common.

Since the truth is the majority of students who study in STEM in US universities are international students, especially in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering area.\n\nThere is no shortage of US students in STEM: Quantity does not mean quality. There are also a huge number of foreign students in STEM but only a very small proportion of them can pass the strict interviews and finally get a job by US companies. \nTo be honest, there is point to say international student is being treated better, I strongly doubt how is this point coming from?

This is just another overreach by the Obama administration that needs to be stopped.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mark Janowski", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4366", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am an international STEM student and I will come to USA soon. I strongly support the 24-month OPT extension project.\n\nAs a master degree holder, the work opportunity after graduation in U.S. is the driving factor for me to apply for American universities. Millions of students, like me, are able to find a job in their original country. The only incentive to pay the expensive tuition fee is the brighter career following program. The suspension of OPT extension will reject them out of U.S. and it will be detrimental to the education. Lets do a simple calculation. Assume that the annual tuition fee plus housing cost per head is $ 50K. The number of international students who have the option to work domestically is 1 million and a half of them will no longer attend American universities if the OPT extension is gone. The potential economic loss will be $ 25Bn, which is approximately the cumulative fund for Harvard University since 1979. The calculation does not account for the consumption tax and any potential value that the students bring to the country in the future. Thus the suspension of OPT extension will lead to a considerable economic loss. \n\nSecondly, the OPT extension will create win-win solution for both international students and the U.S. employers. Students need to gain work experience to better arrange their career, while companies will like to hire international students as cheap labor for short term projects, especially for oversea business. The length of 24 months will be appropriate if the student wish to go home after obtaining enough experience and the short term business is accomplished. With the OPT extension, there is no need for the employers to hire permanent international workers for temporary projects, and in the meanwhile, they are offered an option to give a permanent contract in two years based on their need. \n\nThe opponent states that the OPT might harm the interest of native job seekers. However, competition bring benefits as well. In the circumstance of globalization, evading competition from outside the country is unwise. Strong competition can force American students to be better candidates through their own efforts. Moreover, the competition is unfair to some extent. The native candidates already have comparative advantages in language, social network and culture, and the employers ensure that no foreign candidate will be admitted unless there is no native people capable for the job. Thus, the OPT extension will not trouble local people much regarding the employment.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yaguang Wu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22234", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's a great choice for us to support longer stem opt extension.

The most important thing of a country is technology, and science, and most of the graduate stem students in the U.S are international students, can you image if a country lost 50% of their graduate stem students? it will be extremely major blow to the development of the U.S. Accepting the international students or foreign workers are the great advantage of America.  For example, in nba, many of the players are international player, and that's the reason that nba is the top league in the world. It is quite simple how they succeed, because they accept foreign talented players. Based on the same reason, giving more opportunities for talented students in stem majors is the key of the success of the technology of America.\n\nFor me, I would like to work in the U.S company for a couple of years and then go back China. Because the experience in the U.S makes me more compatible in China.

However, it is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions.

This new extension policy not only apparently benefits the F-1 students who is currently seeking a job or will be in the near future, but also ensures the prosperity, competitiveness, and the continued leadership of U.S. around the globe.\n\nFirst, the STEM students have proven their competence in almost every field of scientific research, reflecting their competitiveness as high quality working force in the future. Just randomly search the research papers in major scientific publication services like Nature, Science, and PRL for example. It is quite easy to see that a lot of the STEM students, coming from Asia and Europe, are making significant contributions. They have showed their intellectual ability, confidence, and determination in scientific endeavors. Given the new OPT extension period, they could apply what they learned from the universities to the real world and make even more contributions than academic research.\n\nSecond, the STEM students have worked for U.S. based companies already, even held very key positions in very famous and prestigious companies like Google and Apple. They boost the innovative power of the respective companies and ensure leading positions of those IT companies worldwide. Just imagine what would happen if they were not able to work in the U.S., but instead work at other counties. The loss of U.S. would become gains in other countries. \n\nLast, I do agree this new policy may hurt someone to some degree in the short run, but the competition is a good thing and could be beneficial to all in the long run. But if we forsake this proposal and create a barrier to protect local employees, its good for them temporarily but at the expense of future innovation. \n\nSo from the long-term perspective, this proposal would definitely make this country a better one. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Minglei Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20439", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT this proposal as it can definitely BENEFIT the United States.

International students is not making the U.S. job market worse but instead the catalyst for creating more jobs in different industries. The number of international students coming to the U.S. to study has been increasing crazily over recent years. They are making significant contributions to various businesses such as restaurants, supermarkets, cars, insurance. Once the business is expanding, it will result in more and more job opportunities being created.\n\n2. International students in STEM fields is a huge drive for the U.S economy growth. They pay expensive tuition fees to stimulate advancement of U.S. higher education systems and academic researches. More importantly, international students have to overcome all different difficulties not only limited to mastering technologies, but also languages, cultures.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, every year I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting.The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers.  \nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest technologies in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months \nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals.Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\nConclusion \nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

There is no doubt that Science and Technology are essential for the economy development of a country. That is why the United States is in an urgency of developing experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).\n2. Though people may argue that other majors are equally important, the truth is, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion.\n3. Therefore, the size of STEM education pipeline needs to be increased. However, due to the difficulty in the STEM degree completion and H-1B visa petition, roughly 40% of college students planning to major in engineering and science end up switching to other subjects.\n4. As a result, students and potential experts in STEM major need to be encouraged. Among the graduate students in US, international students earned only 11.6% of all doctoral degrees in the U.S., but they earn 57% of all engineering doctoral degrees, 53% of all computer and information sciences doctoral degrees and 50% of mathematics and statistics doctoral degrees, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n5. Hence, to protect the STEM major experts, the US government must save international students in this field. According to the 2015 H-1B petition result, there were 233,000 H-1B petitions, but only 65,000 were approved, with a percentage of 27.9%. Such a low number for sure drives away STEM major experts. In fact, nowadays US hasnt been able to attract more talented international students, many of which flock to countries like UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, with more lenient immigration policies that allow them to stay and find work after graduation.\n6. Under this serious condition, I think its very clear that the United States should elongate the OPT extension time, and/or increase the H-1B cap number. If not, the cancellation of OPT extension may slightly increase the US Citizens work opportunities for a short period of time. However, I would expect a huge decrease in the number of Science and Technology experts in the US, which will be a dramatic loss to this country speaking in a long term.\nApart from these points of view, I would like also to state my opinions with the following paragraph: as an international STEM student pursuing a phD degree, I know exactly what the word struggling means. First, its never easy to survive in a STEM major with higher levels of degree. While others watch TV and play games during the night, we work in the lab doing experiments; while others go shopping and hiking during the weekend, we still work in the lab doing experiments. We pay much more efforts so we deserve what we should earn. Second, US citizens already possess much more advantages than international students: most industry companies prefer not to sponsor a candidate; a US citizen doesnt need to worry about being driven out of the country if he/she cannot find a job; a US citizen also doesnt need to worry about losing a job only because of the bad luck in H-1B petition.\nIm writing this support not only for myself, but also for the United States. I always have the plan to go back to my country if the OPT can no longer be extended and I loss in the H-1B petition. However, I do feel sorry for US, a country with abundant resources, large Science and Technology development potentials, a country that holds high tolerance for people all over the world, to lose so many talented experts just because they face problems with their visa. I sincerely hope the US government could seriously consider about the OPT extension issue and approve it to be 24 months.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by YIQUAN LIU", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21818", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Jobs for Americans!

One out of five employees in my group must leave without the approval of the regulation by the end of next February, and the project we are working on cannot meet the schedule and millions of dollars loss may occur.\n\nForeign STEM students working in the US do not steal jobs. The E-verify program will ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. On the contrary, the new regulation helps to create more jobs for Americans. Foreign students regularly contributes a significant amount of money into the US economy. When I went to dealer's to buy a car, the dealer told me so many international students like me came to his since we needed cars for transportation. International students helped his business, and he said he was considering expanding his business. \n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alick Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7196", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n1.

I have graduated from my masters degree from the business school here in the US for more than one year ago, and luckily my application for H1B got selected on its first attempt. Thus, I did not fully utilize the extended OPT even though I graduated from a STEM program. With my background being said I still highly agree on this extension act for the extended OPT from 17 months to 24 months. Following are my reasons of why\n\n1. 24 months policy is more fair to all graduates no matter if they get graduated in May or Dec. From my observations the engineering students in general get more freedom on their graduation time vs students from some other schools. Like my master program was a 9 months program, thus all course times are fixed, and we could only graduate in the month of May. Comparing between the two graduation times  May vs. Dec.), the biggest impact is probably how many times one can submit the H1B application. With the current 17 months policy, graduates in May can get up to two lotery ticket and graduates in Dec. can get up to three. And literally others is no quality difference between the students graduated on these two different times. \n\n2. The extended opt would be more beneficial to the good quality students which ultimately would benefit the US labor market. The extended OPT would only be valuable for someone who already has a job with an e-verified company. Which means the low quality graduates would get naturally filtered out by the job market if they fail to find a qualified job for OPT extension. Thus the few extra months of extended OPT would just be the bridge to help those who need some buffering time before they get their H1B. Which helps the US labor market to keep those high quality graduates. \n\n3. Enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. With the longer OPT time, the graduates can worry less about their H1B application and therefore focus even more on their daily work.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Siqi Peng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21279", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This selling out of AMERICANS, has to stop.

So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Adobe, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \n\nOn the other hand, international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.\n\nForeign students, for example, regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. [13] This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion).

As we all know, a country's economy is pumped by high-tech companies, such as Google and Amazon. With this rule approved, more qualified workers are available to these companies. If these high-tech companies are not doing well, US, as a whole, will lose competition in the world market, sooner or later. The well-being of these high-tech companies not only create many jobs themselves, but also benefit to companies in other industries, such as real estate companies, food providers and so on. Then more and more jobs are available for US citizens in non-STEM major too. \n\nSecond, a lot of excellent technical leaders and entrepreneurs come out of the group of people who took advantage of OPT. These people bring enormous values to the country. For example, they founded companies to high more citizens. Nowadays there are more and more people on the waiting list for a H1B visa. If these excellent people cannot stay and contribute at US, it would be a huge loss to the country. In fact, looking back in the history, US has always been very good at attracting excellent people to work for it. In another words, if these excellent people go to companies in other countries, they can become potential competitors of US companies. \n\nLast, it is shortsighted to blame foreigners for \"stealing\" US citizens' jobs. The long-term benefit of US economy replies on good workers in good companies. Workers on OPT status are a large part of working force in many good companies. Companies know how to choose the best workers in order to grow their business in high-tech fields. They should not be charity organizations that hire unqualified workers. \n\nIn summary, for the benefit of the US economy and all citizens in the long run, extending OPT for STEM students, and even increasing H1B visa quota, should be approved. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Savvy Zeng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8865", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This policy is definitely favourable to national interests. \n1.

The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"  The proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n\nIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\nLARGE COMPANIES can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- much cheaper, than the Americans they replace. \"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recrui ts will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers).\" Because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\nIT IS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS COUNTY WHO BY THE WAY GETS PAID BY TAX DOLLARS CONTRIBUTED BY AMERICAN CITIZENS PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY.  THIS PROPOSED RULE IS A TRAVESTY AND TOTALLY UNNEEDED AND IT COSTS TAXPAYERS WHO PAY YOUR SALARY BILLIONS.\n\nHopefully one day we will be able to get a President in this country who will cut your jobs and your salaries so you will not be able to propose any more of these ridiculous rules.\nThanks very much.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Twyla Tranfaglia", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3366", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I definitely support STEM OPT extension.

The era of big data has revolutionized thousands of industries and has generated HUGE DEMAND for STEM students.\n\n2. In graduate school, there are INSUFFICIENT STEM students to meet the demand, not to mention U.S. students alone.\n\n3. F1 students in the graduate school are the top of the top from all over the world and they are a treasure for the U.S. \n\n4. I (as an F1 student) am doing a 5-year multi-million research project that helps the U.S. solve the species invasion problem using data mining.\n\n\nArguments:\n\n1. \nIt is well accepted fact that the era of big data has already come, and thousands of industries are doing their best to leverage the big data to generate business insights in order to stay competitive against foreign companies. For example, Walmart needs data scientists to help them analyze customers' shopping behaviors and decide how to arrange the merchandises. Auto companies are leveraging data sciences to optimize the design of cars. \n\nLet us speak with data. Check these links to see how demand of big data jobs and data scientists are growing steadily: \nhttps://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=big%20data%20jobs\nhttps://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=data%20scientist\n\nThe skills needed for big data are essentially math for modeling, computer science for designing software, statistics for data analysis, and other engineering and science majors -- these are STEM majors.\n\n2. \nI am in the graduate school of a top 20 U.S. university, and I can tell (first-hand information) the number of the graduate students of STEM majors cannot meet the demand of the companies. Numerous U.S. companies have come to our university to recruit data scientists, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Ford, Chase, Amazon, IBM, and many others that are the pillars of the U.S. Most of my senior colleagues have multiple offers to choose from, showing that the demand is much higher than the supply.\n\nSpeak with data again. This link shows the popularity of STEM PhDs over the past years. The line is almost flat and mismatches with the lines in Part 1.\nhttps://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=STEM%20PhD\n\nFrom what I can see, U.S. students are generally more likely to choose the law school/medical school and are less fond of STEM majors. Also, they are less likely to go to graduate schools. As a result, in my university, MORE THAN HALF of the graduate students of STEM majors are F1 students. If they have to leave the U.S. as soon as they graduate, given the exploding demand for STEM PhD students, who can support the U.S. companies?\n\n3. \nGiven how hard the GRE exams are, F1 students are the tops of the tops from all over the world. They are usually multilingual and know how to help the U.S. companies to extend their businesses overseas. As they can help the U.S. companies to expand, they can help CREATE more jobs for the U.S., rather than taking jobs from U.S. citizens. \n\n4.\nAs a PhD student of computer science, I am working on a 5-year multi-million project supported by NSF and in collaboration with the U.S. government on improving the management of species invasions that are happening in the U.S. If no actions are taken, the U.S. is estimated to loss 120 billion dollars annually due to species invasions. Previous methods such as building dams to prevent species invasions are costly and not effective. Our method is the one of the latest and thorough modeling of the ship-induced species invasion patterns.\n\nHere is the link to our publication:\nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623364\n\nThis is published in the top data mining conference which is peer-reviewed and proven effective. We are currently improving the method and I am one of the leading researchers. If this OPT extension is not passed and I have to leave the country, it will severely impact or terminate this vital research that can help improve the U.S. ecology situations. \n\nThis is just my example, but tens of thousands of F1 PhD students that are more talented than me and working for the common good are also influenced by the OPT extension. If they have to leave the country, it will be a huge loss for the U.S., and in the future talented students that specialize in data mining or other fields of STEM are less likely to come to the U.S. to make a contribution.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jian Xu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12337", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Highly educated international students, especially STEM students should be considered global talents.

But I want to say that it is craven and discrimination. Employers will NOT give a job to an international student just because she is not an American citizen. To employ a suited people is good for the future of a company, as well as the quality of the university education. \n\nImagine that if American government does not welcome the STEM student to have a chance to work here for several years. There are lots of students who are intended to have an education in the US will decide to abandon, which will result for a large salary decrease for the faculty and a lot of unemployment in the university. The loss will definitely do harm to the quality of education and service for student wherever he or she comes from. The situation is that the schools need money and international student need better education and training opportunities. It is, to some extent, a combination. Students from different country studying in the US are really some talented guys, and they study hard to deserve the high tuition. After being well educated in the universities, they are able to work here. \n\nBesides, although the government pay a lot of money to keep the university running well, there is still another question. You can see how many local students major in STEM these years. The amount is much less than required. Who can be hired if you refuse to hire international students? Please remember the OPT is a temporary permit for international students to work here. The government does NOT plan to increase the number of H1B right??? It will never cause a long-term unemployment in America.\n\nLastly, I think that only with the talented people from the US and other countries can the States stays ahead in STEM. I believe you will appreciate if some talented guys from other countries who does something incredibly good here and people in the US will be benefited first. See how many papers in STEM are produced by international guys. The most talented STEM students are studying in the US and I believe that they will make a contribution to the US in the long term.\n\nI am an international student and I will be benefited a lot if this proposal approved. I think that the US will be benefited as well. The United States is a country of equality and freedom. That is why we come here. We appreciate your senses of values.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sarah Y.

Firstly, I think STEM OPT extension is very important to US education. Now US education is the best or one of the best in the world and that is one of main reasons that US is a great country. US education is attractive for not only good education resources but also great opportunities to gain first hand industry experience. A lot of students from all over the world like to come to the states for the graduate programs and what is important is they like to work in the states after graduating from schools. STEM OPT extension means more opportunities for the students and it will make US education more attractive compared to UK education or others. More excellent students will like to come to the states because of STEM OPT extension and it is good that talented students from all over the world work in a great country and create value for the country. Without STEM OPT extension many talented students maybe will go to other countries which seem to be more welcome to international students. I think it is very obvious how important talented people are to a great country.\nSecondly, if an employee want to apply for STEM OPT extension, the employer should participate E-Verify program. The E-Verify program will protect the employee and it may make sure that all employees are treated equally.

After graduation, I was hired by my current employer and I am currently working as an actuarial analyst on my OPT. My OPT will expire on 1/18/2016. My boss is satisfied with my work and he would like to help me get work authorization (H1-B) in the year of 2016. However, the recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, I can't get an H1-B on April 1, 2016 because my OPT will expire before that. Then I will have to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. If that happens, it will mess up my work and the work in my team as well. January is the busy season in my team and my coworkers need my contribution during quarter end. If I have to leave during that time, my boss will have to look for another candidate to fill my position and it's not easy to find a good candidate within a short time. Even though he finds a good candidate, my coworkers still need to spend at least one month to train that person. Personally, it will also have a very detrimental influence on my study experience and career plan. Before I came to the United States, I was pursing a Bachelor degree in Australia. When I was considering graduate schools in the United States and Australia, I chose the United States in the end. One of the reasons is that the United States provides OPT extension to STEM degree holders. In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is appropriate duration to allow me meet my learning goals and work on more projects that better complement academic programs and career interests. I made my study and career plans based on that time length (with OPT extension) since I came to United States. If the OPT extension is eliminated, my whole plan will be messed up. I think that will affect many STEM international students and companies which hire many international students. Especially some IT companies, most of their employees are international students in STEM field. Once the OPT of the employees expires, many people will have to leave their current positions within a short time. STEM students make great contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow the economy and create jobs for all Americans. For more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigration and refugees from around the world into the nation. I came to the United States to pursue an advanced degree because I think it's an open-minded country and I like its diversity.

It is common sense that talents are the most valuable resource. The current prosperity of America was attributed to talent recruiting policies after world war II directly. Extending OPT is a good way to retain more real talent people from international students. In the long run, the talents who still stay in our country will make huge contributions to our country. In my personal case, I have several employees from Asia, they all did very well in their jobs. What's more, it's very difficult to find enough talents if I don't search potential employees from international students. \n\n2. International students do not have direct competition relationship with US citizens. It is not fair but I still have to admit that if I can find a citizen or permanent resident for the position I won't hire OPT or H1B holders because of the cost. In 99% cases, companies was forced to hire non-citizens because they cannot find the right employee from native talent pool. The high technology industry is a good example that they cannot survive without hiring foreign talents. \n\n3. In addition to the last point, International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. \n\n4. The fact that international students often get high salary jobs also means they are required to pay more tax and to take more responsibilities. \n\nI suggest thinking about the following questions.\n1. Who really lead to the unfair competition?\n2. Who don't pay tax but make use of lots of social resource?\n3. What really makes one unable to find a good job?\n4. Who work harder than us but get less than us?", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by johnson Brown", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14550", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": " I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.\nIt is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\n\n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.. \n\nAdmitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mila Tan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13662", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this proposal.\n\nJust look up those Nobel Price winners who are not native Americans but still made huge contributions to US, they first start by applying for jobs in US and by having the opportunity to work in scientific fields. \n\nI believe allowing F-1 students with stem degrees to work would definitely facilitate the progress of US economy.

If the OPT could not get extended, the students could only work for one year, this means the company will lose a fully trained and experienced employee after one year and have to hire someone else and do the training again.

The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. In addition, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies. From my personal experience in Johnson Controls, I can feel there is still enormous need for the designers but what's interesting, 90% designers are foreigners and most of them are using OPT. If the policy terminates, there will be a larger vacancy for those positions which now already urgently needed more fill in. May be next finance crisis would start in manufacturing field with special labor shortage. \n\nI believe OPT is a great policy to solve the job demands and supplies in US and it also can contribute to raise the attractiveness of this country to show the world they welcome all potential talents to contribute themselves to US.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \nI was glad to see the proposed rule for re instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. \nThe proposal to re institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. \nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. \nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 36-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 48 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience. \nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period. \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new immediately. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter. \nSincerely,\nRishi Pathak\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Rishi Pathak", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2980", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support OPT extension for it's beneficial both to foreign students and US society. \n\nIn some of the opposing comments, it has been repeatedly mentioned that OPT extension brings more immigrants into the country.

The decision of removing STEM OPT  extension will abruptly end my current work authorization in Feb 2016. It will not even allow my employer a chance to file H1-b work visa for me. My wife (who works in US) and I are completely baffled about our future due to this decision.\n\nThis new proposal to retain and expand the STEM OPT extension is quite a relief since it provides me more time to continue my learning experience in the most technologically advanced part of the world. Id like to quote some numbers to indicate the economic benefits of retaining international students in the United States by each phase:\n\n1.\tStudent tenure:\n     a.\tRevenue from nonimmigrant visas in the year 2013 assuming a $300 visa application fee for 9.1 million nonimmigrant visas issued is $2.7 billion. This number grew by 2.6% from 2012 to 2013\nSource: http://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2013AnnualReport/FY13AnnualReport-TableI.pdf\n     b.\tTuition fees for international students is almost twice than domestic students. Assuming an average of $25,000 / year in just tuition, for 900,000 international students in 2013-2014 accounts for $22.5 billion. This number grew by 8% from the prior year.\nSource:\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2014/1117/Record-900-000-international-students-in-US-the-top-countries-they-hail-from\n     c.\tApart from my tuition expenses I spent on an average of $500/month in living/food/travel in Cincinnati. For 900,000 students that would be $5.4 billion in additional spending. Note that this is a very low average compared to larger and more expensive Metro cities like Chicago, New York and Boston where 45% of international students study. So the actual number would be even higher.\n\n2.\tSTEM extension tenure:\n     a.\tIn a city like Cincinnati my average monthly spending on lifestyle/living is around $2500. That accounts for $2.25 billion in additional cashflows in the US just by letting international students continue to work\n     b.\tNote that we neither pay nor receive any social security or Medicaid/medicare benefits on a student visa however we still pay all the state, city and federal taxes like any other U.S. citizen. \n\nId like to conclude my comment by saying that international students have a huge economic impact on the country. I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. \n\nSincerely,\nHarsh", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Harsh Parekh", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5284", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a STEM student who just graduated in May this year.

Meanwhile, the 24 months extension will also serve those who get a STEM related job right after graduation a more sufficient working period of a total 3 year at their job positions. Even if they failed to get a h1-b visa to work for a longer time, a 3 year should be a fair time to both the employers and employees. Usually, a STEM related jobs are more technical, which means the people who work at a STEM related position will play a fairly critical role. For example, if a talented STEM graduate get involved in the development of a project or software have to quit on the way just because of the one year OPT without any extension nor h1-b visa, it will cause harm to both the development and the people himself. But, if he can have 2 years extension, situation will be much different. \n\nSecondly, the extension will encourage more talented people to seek for a higher level education in the U.S.. Here, in the U.S., the most developed country, the education and technology are most advanced. The reason behind this is right from its ability to improve its own technology growth as well as uniting the most talented people from all over the world. With the 24 month extension, the resources in the U.S. will be more attractive to those talented and ambitious people from all over the world. Reversely, an OPT without extension will greatly harm the passion of coming to the U.S. to seek for more education because of the potentially limited time of practicing knowledge after graduation. \n\nIn the end, I want to re-state my support for this OPT extension claim. I believe that the OPT extension will become a win-win thing for all.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Frank Stevenson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6368", "postedDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We as a country should be reducing foreign workers instead of increasing them.

Extending the OPT for the F1 student is very necessary and should be in action ASAP. I will explain the reason in the following directions. \n     1) Depriving international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens is totally unjust and against the spirit of the human equality. From this single point, it is already enough to claim the importance of this  proposal. Not to mention that international students paid tuitions, brought diversities and contributed their intelligence to the universities and communities. Yes, people might say these students get their knowledge back as return. However, they ignore the fact that the practical training is also a crucial part of \"knowledge\" that they should be acquire as well in the whole process. Students can never gain real knowledge without proper training, where the places they will end up being or came from won't be able to provide. In such case, OPT, as a part of knowledge, should be in action as a true completion of the study.\n     2) Despite the ethical necessity, it is a physical win-win strategy in both long term and short term. \n     In the long term, as the increasing internationality of all kind, the key point for increasing the job opportunity for US citizen is not to simply hire more, but to keep the job sources alive! In such circumstances, our companies need to gather the forces from all over the world, which is already the case in competitors from outside the US, to keep them competitive. Tis will in turn maintains a considerable job opportunities to the public, of course, including US citizen. This is the true solution for both companies and communities. The extension of OPT is such an strong support to guarantee the source of this internationality. \n     In the short term, which might be the part that most people who against the proposal might concern about, is also of great beneficial. For example, I have a lot of friends use their OPT running startups that hire US citizen employees. According to Kauffman foundation, immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and about 1/4 of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 2006-2012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. So it a beneficial proposal that gives F1 graduates more time to fulfill successful businesses and hence create more job opportunities to the society. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Karl Goldburg", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16733", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Optional Practical Training (OPT) DHS Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002\nThere are many reasons not to expand this rule.  \n1.There are already around 668,000 students in this program, giving employers reasons to hire these people rather than American citizens.

Our country is already experiencing the lowest participation in the workplace in many decades, and anyone that understands the true unemployment numbers knows those put forth by the Administration are pure fiction.  Participation is keen for EVERY job, and not only in the STEM fields.

These are worthy efforts, and should be continued if we hope to maintain competitiveness with the technology students from other countries.  What a slap in the face, then, it would be for one of our young people to enter the workforce with their shiny new STEM degree, only to be pushed aside by non-citizen workers who have been given an unfair advantage -- and in violation of the immigration agreement they signed, at that.

The most important reason I came to study here is because US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents and parts of their development team are formed by people who are using their OPTs. \n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at Jiangxi Microsoft Tech Center, mostly a large software project  would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China.

At a time when so many American born citizens are spending vast sums to get the kind of training that would give them the knowledge and skills to qualify for so-called \"STEM\" jobs this action is unthinkable. My reasons for writing to urge you not to take this action are as follows:\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nI hope that you will consider the needs of qualified STEM workers and students in STEM disciplines over the needs of employers to save money an have a large pool of foreign born cheap labor.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joe Glaston", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3451", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months.

US should keep its competitiveness for international students. Although States has the best education resources in the world, other countries like UK, Canada, Australia, etc. also trying to attract international students by various policies. Training program is definitely one of them. Current one year OPT period is obviously not long enough since students can only get one chance to get a H1-B visa. If the proposal couldn't pass, many students might prefer to choose other countries which could provide a better training program and have a higher chance to get a working visa.\n\n2. Best companies need best new employees all over the world. There is no doubt that US has the world's best companies in STEM field. However, it will be a pity for them if they cannot hire the best college graduates just because OPT is not long enough and students could not get a working visa. In the world's top 10 Internet companies, China already has four places. In an international age like today, talents are the most important factor for every single company and especially the best ones. If companies like Google or Facebook could not hire the best talents due to their identity, it would definitely be a big loss of the US. The OPT extension is obviously a good way to attract the talents all over the world.\n\n3. This proposal will NOT affect US citizens' benefit. For a company to hire an international candidate, it has to show that they cannot find a US candidate first. US citizens always has a higher priority than internationals. Taking more talents from other countries to contribute the US will only make US stronger and this in turn, would definitely bring huge benefit to US citizens.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chenze Zhao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11748", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The U.S. is such a great country because of the migration, of course we should keep more intelligent people", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Homoes  Board", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10584", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This proposed rule is really benefit for the economic growth of the U.S, since as we all know that IT companies contribute a lot to the U.S tax and there are more and more start-ups in this field need STEM students to support them and those start-ups need couple years to get in a right way, losing those STEM students means losing start-ups and as a result, losing more potential job opportunities for the U.S citizens. \nBesides, Those STEM students won't take over U.S citizen's job opportunities, because when STEM is defined, it means we need international students to fill in those positions, which also means we don't have enough experts of U.S citizens to take those positions.

For example, the processor I designed only consists of thousands of logic gates. In real industry, the commercial processors consist of billions of logic gates. There are so much more for new graduates in STEM major to learn from industry to build a solid background, and be prepared for their career life.

If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? Do you people really hate America this much? Here's some reasons why this rule is a crock of shit!\n\n*OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n\n*OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\n* The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. Today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\n*There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\n* OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jo bs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n* The Obama Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\n\n*The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\n\n*The proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\n\n*The rule requires these organizations to set up mento ring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\n\n* On a variety of measures, the foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers. Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\nlace.\n\n* In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\n\n*DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\n\n* Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Steven Stocklin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3875", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is a good initiative because new graduates require training to gain practical skills.

While its benefits to foreign STEM students, in terms of the added value of their learning experience in this country, is very obvious, I think there are also significant benefits to the US.\n\nFirst of all, this rule would help to provide a steady stream of additional highly skilled workers into the US economy. Many comments emphasized the competition that these foreign students may bring to the US job market. However, one should realize that the job market is not a zero-sum game. The additional foreign students would bring in new expertise and more importantly fresh ideas to help grow the economy. An improved economy means better wage and more work opportunities for everyone, but mostly for US citizens. Let's focus on how to make the pie bigger, not how to carve one that may even shrink otherwise.\n\nSecondly, a healthy dose of competition is vital in keeping US workforce from being complacent. While these students are too small in numbers to have an impact on the overall scarcity of US jobs, they do represent some of the brightest young people across the globe. By allowing them to not only study, but also work along US workers, it would serve as a reminder to all US workers what kind of intellectual competition they are facing in a world where globalization of commerce is rapidly spreading.\n\nLastly, the cost of inaction is huge. A large portion of the students affected by this ruling are those who have studied in some of the best US institutions for four to six years, during which time they were likely doing some of the most cutting edge research in all fields of STEM. If their access to the US job market is severely curbed by a shortened STEM OPT program, they may be forced to seek employment in other countries. In that way, the added benefits of highly skilled workers to the economy mentioned in the first argument will be transferred to foreign countries. And this means the competence of US companies will be harmed, which will have a negative impact on the US economy. This will affect every US citizen.\n\nAs a conclusion, the extension of current OPT program will provide better transition for STEM students to contribute to the US economy and create job opportunities for US citizens. In the meantime, the cancellation of this extension would force these valuable high skill workers to the competitors of US companies and harm US economy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Henry Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16284", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.\n\nI've read some of the comments for the opponents.

Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by R.T.

The lack of American citizens who's willing to study or work on those jobs. I don't think it's necessary to count how many students in STEM majors are Americans. Just by one glance, we already know the answer can be less than 20%! We all know those STEM majors are difficult to learn. Most of the time they can easily make students frustrated. That's why less and less American students are willing to choose STEM as their major. Then who's gonna do the job after graduation? Immigrants! Absorbing oversea talented people is the only way to fill the hole where there is not enough labors.\nSo my conclusion is the government should let the students who learn knowledge from U.S. universities keep making contributions to the U.S society.

There are thousands of international students get their jobs at IT company, they are brilliant and have high educational background, but only 50% of them can get H1B visa every year. If the OPT extension is canceled, the rest of these people will have to leave America immediately. This will be a significant lose to American economy. \n\n3. The U.S. consists of immigrants from the old and most of them made a huge contributions to this country. For example, lots of people came to America during The Second World War, most of them are professionals, engineers and scientists (Albert Einstein is one of them).

Lots of biggest tech breakthrough enjoys the contribution of foreign talented people and in the Current USA, high-tech jobs are still lacking of suitable local candidates. In addition, now all tech industries varies from high-tech company to Hollywood industry benefit from the contribution of foreign people in STEM major. Even in academic society, there are tons of people become professors or senior researchers who was not U.S citizen, which contributes a lot to science breakthrough for USA.\n\nAlso, after more talented people has more time to work in USA, it also helps the local employers to interact with people from all of world daily and has pressure and ambition to gain more knowledge to work as a team in some certain high-tech area. Also, it also helps the globalization of the USA.\n\nAlso, it benefit the student under OPT and help them to gain more working experience in USA and do more contribute to USA. If the proposing rule fails, I doubt lots of talented students will give up the chance to go to USA or give up the idea to work in USA, which costs great loss.\n\nAll in all, the proposing opt extension rules for STEM major student is necessary and contributes a lot to USA economy.

The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion.

Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

On the contrary, a huge portion of international students are learning STEM and are DOING GREAT. \n\nMaybe 10 years ago, we do not need that much of foreign tech work force since we do not have too many technology companies.

It's definitely not an easy story to explain. But, if you know how intensively our industries have been eager to hire those STEM foreign students, how these excellent workers have been devotedly contributing this country, you will have to support the new HSD rule. Don't say those foreign students are not qualified or just equally qualified as native students. The fact is most of them have struggled through much more fierce competition to obtain the opportunity to study in our colleges, and the training opportunities to work in our companies. Most of them are among the best students in their original countries. They finally succeed in competing with rivals from different countries, including US. It is a strong statement that they could be better workers. I believe this is one of the main reasons why our industries want them to stay. For the same reason, for the better economics growth in our country, I have to support to give foreign students more opportunities to make contribution to us. Otherwise, we will not only lose such talented workers, also our colleges will lose more international students due to the less attraction if we don't allow them to stay long enough after graduation. It can be easily seen, without the considerable amount of financial support from these foreign students, our students will no doubt pay higher tuition to attend colleges.

Also,I will continue to work for my company in order to become a better enterprise. I think all the foreign students with advanced degree who graduate from American universities will make a great contribution to the development of USA economy. They work so hard to find a job and utilize the knowledge to make profits for the US companies. They don't deserve to be deported from this country.These people are great assets for US so that they should have a longer period to stay in USA. So I hope the proposed rule could pass smoothly.

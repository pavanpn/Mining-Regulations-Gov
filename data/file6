It only creates more equal opportunities. A lot of angry comments fixate on the idea that rightful American jobs are stolen by foreigners. I empathize but disagree because it implies that international students get the jobs unfairly. Quite the contrary, they are employed because they work harder and are more skilled than the ones who are not. In many cases, even if they are more qualified, positions are not offered because of their immigration statuses. I understand it is unpleasant to lose job to a foreigner. But what about getting a job not because of being better but because of being American? The citizenship should not entail any superiority. And the prevalent double standard is absurd. If we follow the idea of \"they should work hard and earn it like Americans do\" as many opponents put it, the rule should be welcomed, only to be fair. \n\nWe all know competition is good. The whole concept of free market is based on competition, not monopoly. The foundation of America is based on democracy, not dictatorship. Insecurity leads to failure, not success. But why are people so insecure when it comes to a fair competition? The only outcome of competing with international students is to become better and more qualified. Isn't that a good thing? This insecurity is also unfounded. STEM majors are relatively unpopular among American students. Only a small fraction of the graduates would actually face the (fair) competition. The doom of jobs taken over by foreign STEM students is exaggerated. \n\nAmerica is one of the most accepting and diverse countries. Reading the comments makes me sad.

How will this proposed program effect the American-born college graduate trying to gain employment, at a pay level that allows a higher-than-average quality of life, and still pay the debt of a college degree, or degrees?\n\n5. Since there is much talk about the 'Student Loan Bubble', please provide specific details that explain how this program will effect this potential issue?  As you may already know, if the USA has one more down-turn in the economy, considering it's still frail recovery, many of the student loan institutions (e.g. Sallie Mae, ACS and National Education, etc.), will necessarily either be 'rescued' by the federal government, using Real-American's tax dollars, or go out-of-business due to bankruptcy.  Why would the any branch of the American government put a program like this up for consideration?\n\n\nPlease Advise in Detail,\n-Brian", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Brian Hoffman", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3058", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Hello everyone,\n\nIt's obvious that in the American job market, American people always have priority over international students. This is because companies have to apply visa and process files for international employee, which means they need to pay more money and effort for hiring international employee. Moreover, some companies, for example which don't enroll E-Verify, can't hire international students at all. When you read recruitment flyer, it's not surprising to see \"US citizens-only\" for some job types.\n\nHowever as far as I know, there are still many international students working in American Companies. That means hiring managers are willing to give international students a chance even they know they need to pay more for this, and they also know that international students must have weaker English skills. According to my friends who are working at American Companies, the reasons are as following:\n1. International employee are diligent, they are willing to work overtime and don't claim any overtime pay.\n2. They don't complain that much. The United States is the best country providing reliable food quality, great environment, sufficient salary, etc. So working and living in the United States is really good enough for them, they are satisfied and there is no need to complain even sometime they feel tired.\n3. They are smart. Usually international students often have higher GPA in their study at US.\n4. They don't cause troubles. As far as I see, there are few international employee commit crime. They are well educated and honestly more cautious and timid.\n\nThus, international students have many special advantages in hiring managers' view even though they have less priority than American people. So this means, international employee are needed for their special value and the existence of international employee doesn't hurt the employment rate in the United States nor the efficiency of companies: if one American candidate is as good as an International candidate, the American candidate will definitely get the job offer because he/she has higher priority. If an International candidate wins a job offer while an American candidate loses, then the International candidate must be more potential, thus can contribute more to the company.\n\nIn summary, international students are a valuable source which contributes to US prosperity, especially in the areas of Science, technology and Engineering. They deserve to work longer and bring more benefits to American companies.\n\nThanks for your attention.\nBest regards.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuxiong Zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17359", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "America was and is continued to be built by immigrants.

I read the rule and the comments, for the concerns of those who do not agree, I could give some of my evidence from my point of view.\nI graduate from University at Buffalo, at our school, there is not only international student, but also a lot of citizen talents. Every student could find their dream jobs if they study good enough(70/100 scores). the only difference is citizen only needs \nFirst, average 1 month to find a job while a foreign student need to start searching and sending their resume 1~2 years before graduate. It was a very tough period for all international student, but I think it is the difficulty international student need to overcome if they want to be treated closer to citizens(include language or other reasons). \nSecond, always, find a job is not easy for the place do not have your major. Companies will calculated the cost to transport you to local. As I know, most of the local company at Buffalo only accept citizen. And if you think about the some location like D.C where do not have so many companies in your major, even citizen could hardly find a job. For my experience, I applied more than 500 jobs but only get about 20 replies, most of them is just a phone interview. But when I move to San Jose, the percentage of getting a interview out of application just increased to 1/2. so my advice is do not be afraid to go other states, western is not built in one day, Americans! be brave as your ancestors\nThird, foreigner is not only consuming jobs, they also create jobs. Youtube, Nvidia, Juniper, Yahoo, etc. Everyone is a seed, this land is suitable earth for them to grow, and when they grown up, they will feedback. Otherwise, if the earth is barren, the whole forests will dead.\nFourth, for most of the OPT jobs, people have to get enough wage as they will apply for H1B later. even without OPT, immigrants is still keeping the number. For example, everyone knows the disney case this year, those people do not study in US but still replace the citizens who served disney for years just because they do not have education in US and cost less. So obey the rule will not bring benefits for citizens. \nSo, I do think OPT_extension rule could help create more jobs, and keep US leading the world!\nThanks!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhiyong Zhan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12738", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "No doubt the opt extension is legal and it should be approved.\n\nThe best nation in the world should not afraid of the good competition and should treat it as a method to improve everyone himself/ herself.  \n\nThe international student should be given an opportunity to work and prove themselves here.

Compared to other types of jobs, the engineering jobs requires more technical skills and the life cycle of the tasks and projects is longer and require more time for the engineers to get familiar with new methodologies and tools. Thus, extending the OPT period for engineering students could let us have more time to exposure to the new technologies, learn deeply and contribute ourselves better to the projects and tasks. For us, these experiences will build up knowledge map and become valuable when we go back to our country and start new career.

In my point of view, \n\n1). One of the directest results is that more students abroad will be attracted to further their study in the U.S.. as the new OPT extension policy makes international students see more employment opportunities after their graduation, which is considered as one of the most important factors affecting students choice for schools\n2). The economy will be improved as a result of the trend of studying in the U.S.. More international students or more foreign workers will thus create more business in eduction, housing, transportation, and etc. They will also bring their families to the U.S for visiting or traveling.\n3). Tech industry will for sure be greatly improved as well because of the policy. For employees, OPT extension creates equal career market and they have more opportunities to make best of their talents and skills; For employers, they have more options and power to select the best from the best, which will directly result in industry growth and economy development. \n4). The new extension policy helps to relive the tension caused by limited H1B quota. For many foreign students, they may just want to stay and work for two to three years and go back to their home countries. This is especially true for many Chinese students born in 1990s, as most of them are the \"only child in their families. They are working towards the balance between pursuing their careers and taking care of their parents. \n5). Opposition will arise constantly if this extension policy wouldn't pass, since not only do international students benefit from the new policy, but also companies and governments do and even the ordinary citizens and residents do. More high tech talents will contribute to strong social security. One of the examples will be the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles. Though the neighborhood around is still not safe enough, compared to years ago, the safety levels been greatly improved as more and more foreign students come to USC and live nearby, which also leads to more and more effective actions by the school and Department of Public Security to protect people. In addition, rent becomes one of the most important incomes for many residents. Apartment rental agencies and car rental agencies started to develop as well. The new extension policy will, more or less, influence everyones life in a good way. \n6). The cancellation of OPT STEM extension is against the conceptions and benefits of the nation. The U.S. is  an immigration country and its well known for its openness to talented people. Though like the U.S., the U.K. also has the well-developed higher education, more and more foreign students tend to come to the U.S. rather than the U.K. and one of the decisive reasons is that employment environment in the U.S. is far superior to that in the U.K.. On a further thought, many large and famous tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc, are from the U.S. rather than the U.K., I believe OPT extension policy makes its contribution to the development of these companies. \n\nIn short, the new extension policy will benefit both foreign students and local residents. Its also in the fundamental interest of the nation.

Tuition is not low for most of the master programs provided to international students, and one of the reasons we are here is that we believe that the education combined with the practical training is worthwhile. One-year time is far from enough for an entry-level trainee if he/she wants to grasp the idea of the professional or the post-graduation academic world by participating in a project from the beginning till the end. \n\nMore often than not, we are renting during our stay in the US, which brings the local housing market a huge rise in demand, not to mention sometimes we are just serious buyers of all kinds of products, from outfits, foods to furniture, electronics... All these are our ways to boost US economy (another benefit for having us here besides keeping US higher educational institutions globally competitive~). \n\nConcerns were raised about employers preferring international students because we are asking for lower compensation, but as far as I can see, all of my friends, as well as myself, are being paid equally as US citizens, and the new rules are making sure such situation stays the same. Furthermore, the new rules require the implementation of a formal mentoring and training system by the employer to enhance the quality of practical training for international employees, which will make the hiring cost for an international employee even higher. From my point of view, as I have just gone through the on boarding process, my employer (and hopefully most of the employers) is not hiring international STEM students because of the lower hiring cost(actually the cost is higher), but because they actually needed someone with certain background and skills. Being an international student provided no help during the hiring process, and we actually consider ourselves lucky if we are not discriminated because of our international background.\n\nTo sum up, I think the new rule successfully found its way to not only regulate the hiring process for international students so that we are hired solely because of being a good fit for the job, but also ensure proper training plans are set up so that we get adequate industry or academic experience after graduation and before we return to our own country.\n\nTherefore, I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Linyi Dong", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18668", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "For those F-1 nonimmigrant students who are able to find jobs in the U.S. and continuously working till the end of OPT extension, they are already qualified for contributing to this country for longer time.

US has the worlds best education recourses  that is why it is attracting millions of students from all around the world. These students, after receiving well education and acquiring the necessary skills, are important intellectual source of USs technology companies. They can make great contribution to USs society if opportunities are provided. Meanwhile, these students will create an atmosphere of loving science and technology  which will bring positive effects to local students. For example my lab will host activity to introduce what is the technology we are developing to local middle school students. They are really attracted by it  and some of them think engineer is like the train driver before ! I would like to point out that these activity was organized by research assistance from Indian, Turkey, China, and also Iran. They are making their own contribution to this country using their knowledge. \n\n(2) Providing more opportunities  for foreign students, in the long run, will not harm the US citizens right. \n\nI guess one of the important reason of those who reject extending OPT is that it encourages local company to hire foreign students  which potentially harm the benefit of local students. However this is not quite true. \n\nFace it, when two comparable graduate students  one from US another from other country are competing for one job, most likely the US student will win. The employer will consider foreign students only when the gap cannot be filled by local students.. or the performance of US students is much worse. To be more clear  if we add too many limitation to foreign students, this will only protect those local students who are not competitive enough. Finally, it is the USs technology company whose benefit is harmed as they cannot  get some of the best students because of the limitations imposed on them.  \n\n\n(3) Limitation and restriction is not the answer, openess is.\n\nUS is a country that built by immigrants.  Smartest people from all over the world were attracted to US by its openness. They come here because they were excited by the so called American dream: everyone have the right to pursue happiness, everyone can achieve success by hard working and being integrity. This spirit roots in US culture and is the key element that help US, make the transient  from the homeland of few Indian people, to the most wealthy and powerful  country in less than 500 years. Imposing limitation to STEM students,  deriving their opportunity to work here directly betray this spirit. First it is STEM students, then who would be next group that harm the right of US citizen and should be kicked out ?  After more groups are listed as unwelcome people who would still willing to invest time, energy and money to help building this country ?

It provides a simple way to retain the best brains at minimal cost to the country. It is argued in many previous comments that the proposed rule will make it harder for US citizens to find STEM-related jobs.

Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world.

This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for.

This data in a way shows that foreign students are not staying in the US. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the immigration limitation. To work in the United States long term a F-1 student had to obtain a H1-B visa, which is under strict annual quota (65,000) and subjects to lottery. With longer OPT period, foreign students will be given more chance to obtain a H1-B visa, thus staying in the US.\n\nSome said that foreign students would take away jobs from Americans. That's not really a case, even if without the proposed no-termination-of-US-workers-for-OPT-students rule. In 2011, there were about 26M STEM jobs in the US (http://www.governing.com/gov-data/stem-jobs-employment-map.html); in 2013, there were about 0.34M foreign student pursuing a STEM degree in the US (https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/by-the-numbers1.pdf). That could roughly translates into less than 0.1M foreign student getting a STEM degree in the US per year. 26M v. 0.1M. This is a 260:1 ratio (should be higher considering that job market was expanding). The influx of foreign student has a impact on job market that is less than 0.5%, which is minimal.\n\nOne also need to look at the competition created by foreign students that go back home. They had access to top tier American technologies, resources and connections. And then they go back home, start companies or serve government agancies or enter R&D field, all competing with US interests. If we could help them stay, they can serve our interest rather than competing with.

In general, I agree what has been declared in the 'Cost and Benefit' section. The proposed rule will be beneficial for education and industry.\n\nFor a long time US universities provide the finest education quality and environment for students from all over the world. The international fresh blood is one of the major reasons these universities can be constantly competitive. F1 visa holders provide these schools both high-quality students and excellent faculties as well. A large proportion of this population rely on OPT to find their position in the job market. With the current 17-month OPT, many of them will have to leave simply because of bad luck. So obviously, one of the benefits of this proposal is that the attractiveness of US universities would be largely enhanced, and those real good legal immigrants will be more likely to be able to stay and contribute.\n\nSecond of all, the reason for some US residents' opposing this rule is their worries about jobs being taken by 'foreigners'. But they neglect the fact that outstanding international STEM students are also an active group of people creating jobs. Many successful high-tech companies are started by immigrants. These companies hire US residents as well as immigrants, and their owners are also H1 visa demanders. Not long ago, a founder of Twitter had to leave US because he could not get H1 visa by the end of his OPT. You could imagine that the extension of OPT would create a much more friendly environment for these immigrants to start their businesses, help keep industries booming and result in the creation of millions of jobs, which is good for everyone. So to a great extent, the worry of opponents is unnecessary. \n\nBased on these facts and analysis, I think this extension has overwhelming benefits. I hope it can pass.

For international students, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more opportunities to fulfill their potentials.\n\nAs for people who disagree with this proposed rule, in my opinion, most of them are afraid that international students are competitiors for their job positions. I think they do not have to worry about this. First, international students who receive the STEM degree can only apply for jobs related with STEM, so job positions in other fields like finance, medicine, politics etc. are still available for US citizens as before. Secondly, if people are anxious about the competitiveness brought by international students, why don't they spend more time to improve their own skills instead of wasting time leaving comments here? Tech companies will never hire you if you are not qualified regardless of your citizenship!

Blindly extending OPT can endanger national security. Who would benefit from this extension of OPT? Foreign students.

Is there a guaranteed reason for them to change their affection through a couple of years of student life? Not very likely. And not for everybody. Why would America unconditionally allow these people to stay and bring uncertainty into national security? Let's not forget what identity some of the 9/11 terrorist entered and stayed in the country. The answer is F1 student visa.\n\n2. Giving away leading position in technology and knowledge. Allowing these foreign students to come and study, then allowing them to gain access to industry, it does no good to America but giving away technology and knowledge. It is not a secret that some foreign government are actively stealing from US firms for technology even without the aid of insiders. Allowing these foreigners to gain more access to the industry would make it even easier for foreign government to steal from the United States. For example, government A could be calling a student who just been hired into a tech firm to either insert a flash drive into a company's database or have his family back in his native country to face hardship. What would the student choose?\n\n3. By giving the opportunities to foreign students, it takes opportunities away from American students. It is a zero sum game in most of the situation.

This is the latter part. (In case some haven't read my previous one, I repeat some contents.\n\nSecond, I will show the necessity, importance and benefits to endorse the new rule.   \n\n  1, Now is the era of collaboration. USA must cooperate with the world to flourish. \n     For example, China is raising and thus has lots of opportunities for American companies. It is an advantage to Chinese in the company, for the following reasons: \n      1) Chinese has its own business culture (such as making deals when having meal).  Thus, Chinese employees tend to make the deal done faster and better than the Americans. Moreover, just seeing a familiar face in the same county makes people feel familiar and friendly. It is an advantage when doing business.\n      2) Chinese are born and raised in China, so they know what Chinese want, i.e. know the market. They will come up with more suitable business plan.\n     3)  When the employees went back to China, whether starting their own company or working in a new one, they are connection for  their former American employers in China. Those students are educated and trained in USA. Therefore they have attachment for USA, i.e they have a high possibility of giving special treats to USA.\n\n2. When those students go back to their home country, they may provide better servise for America . They learn American culture and their need during working here. If they start any company, it has higher chance to serve USA better than the ones who dont have the experience.\n\n3. We know the ratio of international students in STEM is very high. For example, our department has 9 international students out of the 18. It is a official recognition for the intelligence and diligence of international students. Letting these talented young people join the workforce of America will definitely promote the further development of America. Especially, STEM is most important areas that serves the society. The cutting-eage tech will make American life easier and better. Moreover, if they finally stay and become citizens. They are high-educated and they tend to let their kid been educated well. Thus, their offsprings will also be good workforce for America.\n\n\n4. Giving international students opportunities to stay is to build a good competition environment. This will help current citizens improve themselves. For example, I am always helping my friends with their study. Last week, we were doing math. One of them found that I directly deduced some equations into simple forms, as i memorized a lot of common equations before. She admired me and would try to memorize too.\n\n5. Last but not the least, the United States is a nation of immigrants. It was founded and developed by immigrants. History sees the contribution of them. The United States welcomes people from every country and culture. Deprives the right of international students is thus definitely a betrayal of American Spirit!    \n       \nIn conclusion, I support the rule. Furthermore, I suggest to issue more H1B for international students.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by mengya (Mia) hu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16196", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposal.

The average tuition per year they spend is $30000. Totally U.S. education system receives 400000 * 30000 = 12000000000 = 12 billion USD per year. One of the most important reasons they choose U.S. for receiving advanced education is because it provides the best after-school training opportunity (17 months STEM OPT). If U.S. education system can not provide STEP OPT extension in the future. It will lose its compatibility to the other countries that are providing it. Considering that a considerable portion of the future students will abandon the plan to study in U.S. The educational expenses collected from them will have to be collected from other sources, which eventually amortized to every U.S. citizen. \n\n(3) STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. H1B does. Don't blame at the wrong thing.\n\nMany have the misunderstanding the OPT students are taking away job opportunities that belongs to them. That is completely WRONG. OPT/STEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education only. The OPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted to H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local residents. According to 2015 data. Among the filed 215000 H1B applicants, only 30000 (less than 13%) are STEM OPT students. The results of 2015 H1B approval also shows that only less than 15% of the approvals are given to OPT students, the rest are granted to workers that are imported from other countries directly. If government want to control foreign workers and keep more jobs to local resident. The right thing is to issue a H1B policy change.

As an international student majored in materials science, the most important reason I choose to study here in US not any other countries like British is because US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. This industry training opportunity makes us competitive in the job market when back to our home country. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I do not believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. For example, Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. In 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. As a result, more international students were attracted to pursue their study in Canada.\n\nSecond, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it probably will slow down the plan of those companies who want to expand their oversea business as lack of directly markets knowledge from graduated international students. And also it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.\n\nThird, some of the other comments argue that their jobs are taken by international students. But what I see is that in my department, all the native US students can find very good job after they graduated. It's not international students who take away their jobs, it's ability. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Riemann Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16265", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT IS BEING DONE - LEARN TO COMPROMISE AND GET THE JOB DONE IN CONGRESS!\nSTOP  BEING A TWO YEAR OLD AND HOLDING YOUR BREATH BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING THE WAY YOU WANT!\nWHEN BOTH PARTIES ARE ONLY HALF HAPPY WITH A DEAL IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by A FED UP CONSTITUENT FED UP", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10078", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "A much awaited stem extension all the international students have been waiting for.\nUSA promises to be a land of opportunities .", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chetan Madannagari", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0884", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the DHs new rule over Stem students as it woud be really unfair for those who are non stem students.

Relinquishing talented foreign students benefits Americans in short run, but it reduces U.S. overall competitiveness in long run. U.S. has long been a nation of immigrants. Maintaining / elaborating STEM OPT extension is justifiable as long as the regulation is carried out fairly.\n\n(2) History speaks itself\n    Many high-achievers in various fields were immigrants (foreign students) before they achieved their success. U.S. has long been a country that smart and hardworking people prevail, so why \"restricting\" supply of smart people to U.S.? Contributions of the foreign immigrants make U.S. a better country, indirectly giving U.S. substantial capability to define future directions of the world.\n\n(3) Effect towards American workers is not as severe as many people has thought\n    Undeniably, American students will be affected by competition brought upon by international students. However, the effect is not as severe as many people has thought. Given same capability, an employer will normally choose an American due to better cultural fit and cheaper financial obligation (no sponsorship). The employers are willing to pay higher price to retain foreign workers for an obvious reason: foreign workers fill in the needs that are unable to be met by American workers. It is not American workers are not good, it is just great, talented workers are insufficient in U.S., which has the economy with the biggest potential in the world.\n\n(4) There are better ways to reduce effect towards American workers than omitting STEM OPT extension\n    Rather than omitting STEM OPT extension, why don't set up harder requirement to get Green Cards? Why don't set up caps based on countries? Omitting STEM OPT extension reduces motivation of foreign students to study at U.S., which affects revenues of U.S. educational institutions too. A lot of foreign students plan to work at U.S. for around 5 years before returning to their home country. In view of this, there must be a better way to reduce effect towards American workers.\n\n  These are my honest opinion. Feel free to address / criticize.

International students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Pan Tan", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13460", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I feel that the proposed rule from the DHS to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a unfair to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates.

Many of them also joined many startups which increase a great deal of job positions for the local people. Without such opportunities for those international students, I don't think the number of international students will stay the same in future. In other words, this country will definitely lose a great number of its own economy contributors.\n\nFurthermore, some people fear that international students will make the job competition more fierce in the future. However, I do believe that it is the competition that makes this country prosperous as she is today. Competition is the key reason that makes an elite a elite. We can never lock ourselves up just because of the competition. This is the worldwide trend. We have to alert our children and help them to be more competitive in the future. Only in this way can our children learn how to work hard and enjoy the happiness that they fight for.\n\nFinally, I think some people who quote the so-called \"protection for citizens\" are just making nonsense. I believe this is the biggest fight against American US born citizens! As mentioned above, without a good environment, the leadering role of our IT industry can no longer maintained. In other words, lots of people will definitely lose their jobs in the future! As we all know, IT industry is and will continuingly be the most important factor that makes a great country in this century. This era needs those talents. Like China, India, and other countries, they are also making efforts to attract these talented people back, even Americans.

I am an international student from China. I have been in the US for three years. I am under the original 17 months OPT extension and work for a small company in Columbus, OH. I can show the benefits of this regulation to the US economy from my own experience. \n\n1) The American economy is great because of its freedom and creativity. The most important factor for the great economy is talented people who have a creative mind and good working spirit. Most of the  international students coming to the US are working on a higher degree like master or PHD. They have good knowledge and research background. They contribute all their time to publishing high quality paper and patent. They are the engine of the new technology. They are also coming from different countries which have cultures of diversity. They will bring a different vision to the US society which is also good for the creativity. The international students will make the scale of the economy bigger and larger by their creative minds. This will turn to create more job opportunities and even more new industries. They are not competing with American people. They are helping American people to get hired and get more options for career.\n\n2) Based on the current immigration laws for high tech immigrants, the companies need to sponsor their foreign employee to get the legal working visa to work for them. It means the companies will spend more to hire international students. In a fair job market, there is no reason for a company to hire an international students prior to a native. As for the career fair I went before in the university, more than 90% of the company will not hire an international students if they do not have great skills specific for a job position. The only chance the company will consider international students is when they can not find a good candidate for the work. In this case, the international students do not compete with the natives. They just fill the blank spot in the job market. It not only does not hurt American workers, but also solve the problem for the HR.\n\n3) The international student coming to the US receive good education. They would like to get involve in the American society. They have work to do and are eager to have a great future in American. They make the community safer and better. They pay taxes and buy goods. They use their knowledge to contribute to the US and also spend money to boost US economy. The politician always discusses about illegal immigrants, but they forget the legal immigrants who make this country better. There should be a good immigration system to let these talented people to stay. If this country cannot show his kindness to these people, it will only hurts American economy.\n\nFor all these reasons, I support this new ruling to be approved and hope American natives can understands what it means to us and this country.

Revocation of OPT STEM will jeopardize the education industry\n\nMost of the international students has chosen America as their first choice for foreign study because of the existence of the OPT and STEM program, which give students enough time to gain relevant working experience and evaluate their own career path after graduation. Most of the students will stay if they are able to find a job that matches their expectation of career development. US does have a lot of famous universities in the world, but a degree is only valuable with the corresponding training experience together.\n\nWithout OPT STEM, America will be much less attractive to international students. A thought like \"Why would I go to a country for study where they take away my money but don't provide a way for me to stay and develop\" is pretty common. Considering that the tuition and fees in most US colleges is pretty expensive and is still keeping going up, no one is willing to spend at least 100k dollars and just get a degree in return, and then forced to leave the country.\n\nIf the number of foreign students goes down, colleges will not only lose necessary money to support research and development, but also lose talents from all around the world, who has been contributing to this country for a long time. \n\n2. Revocation of OPT STEM will jeopardize industry revenue\n\nI'm in the IT industry, and clearly a lot of IT companies hire many international students. Revocation of OPT STEM will result in a huge gap for these IT companies due to the lack of labor power. Their revenue will certainly drop down and they have to spend much longer time on recruiting.

If they are forced to leave the country, they will go back to their own country, start their own companies and eventually become competitors. However, if they are able to stay, it's very likely that they will start companies in the US, which will provide more opportunities of employment and contribute to US economy.\n\nWhat makes America America is its immigrant-friendly environment and make people believe that their dream will eventually come true in this country.

I can't tell any logic within those comments. It just looks like they are venting anger on their incapability to find a job, but not a convincing debate.\n\nFirst of all, you at least need to know what is STEM. STEM means science, technology, engineering and math, and the related jobs are software developers, research scientists, data analysts, statistician, and etc. \n\nThen you need to know why there are such requirement to propose such a proposal by DHS. It is because that American students don't want to learn these majors. I haven't met even one American friend who didn't wince when he/she got to know my major is statistics. From their perspective, it is painful and boring to deal with numbers everyday, and to debug to midnight. Finance, business, medicine, law, and psychology are much cooler than STEM. Those are their favorites. \n\nPeople say American companies/government don't want to recruit American students. That's 100% not true. If an international student is competing one opening with an American student and they both are equally qualified, the employer definitely prefers to recruit the American student. Actually, among all of my classmates in grad college, I have never seen any American students who can't find a job. Those who can't find a job are international students, without any exception.\n\nHowever, the quantity of those American students willing to study STEM is way lower than the number needed by industry. As a result, companies have to provide certain working permission, such as OPT, to international students so that they can employ them.\n\nFrom a market point of view, this working permission to international students makes good sense. Companies can't get enough qualified American grads. The international students are not only well qualified, and usually very very diligent. It helps the employer to generate more profit. There is no reason for an employer to not employ such an employee if it can't get enough qualified American candidates. \n\nAs I know, Americans are very proud of their spirit of freedom, and also encourage free contention. Americans pay more respect to the winner who earns his success with his own strength and effort. That's what the American Dream stands for, and why America can be the No.1 country in this earth. International students earn their working opportunity with their effort, knowledge, skills, and diligence, but not begging for it. They contribute their own sweat to make this great country better. They deserve working permission. It is not fair to deprive the opportunity earned by themselves. It is not fair to enforce the companies to swallow loss with administrative power, and it will finally harm the future of US by breaking the American spirit.\n\nNow you know why it completely unreasonable to blame International students and OPT for stealing your job. No one is stealing your job. It is just because you don't want to do it, but I am willing to. You can't call others take what doesn't belong to you steal.

The fact Rubio (whose parents were foreigners - Cubans) supports the taking away/giving away jobs from Americans, making more of us unemployed is the ultimate of wrong.. \n\nThis position shows how massively out of touch Rubio and his cohorts in the government are regarding the replacing of Americans with foreigners. The U.S. unemployment isn't the government lie of 5.5%, but closer to 25% for unemployed and grossly underemployed Americans. \n\nI have personally had to train some of these people so I could turn over work at the end of a contract (they aren't necessarily trained as government supporters contend). In 2002, I witnessed a company go thru 3 foreigners before they found an American accompanied by a foreigner to satisfy the performing of a technical task. \n\nTheir unspoken goal is to control all of the world's Information Technology. The group that controls all of the world's technology can control the world. They have access to your personal bank, insurance and numerous other accounts.\n\nThe tenure of these people in this country is supposed to be an initial 3 years with a \"possible\" extension of another 3 years (for a total of 6 years). The government does not police those who have expired visas and deport these Federal law breakers. \n\nIt is estimated, there are over one million of these people in country with expired visas taking jobs from unemployed Americans. Rubio wants to triple the visa cap? Does Rubio have a foreign bank account that is being filled with rupees?? \n\nAfter all, our government is patterned after that of ancient Rome, where military over-extension, the devaluing of their currency (removal of precious metal content from coinage), bribes and corruption brought about Rome's downfall. I vote for someone-else, who wants to \"make America great again\". \n\nThere needs to be a government bounty placed on these law breakers to clean-up our country. American workers within companies could easily identify who needs to go. Some have bragged about being in country over 13 years. \n\nI have identified some that have been in country since 1998. Some of the offenses perpetrated by these people is the assumption of American names (so they can hide from being detected). \n\nThey will group together and speak in their native language. They do this gathered at the coffee pot while Americans are hard at work. They may be talking among themselves to solve a deficiency one of them have, or they may be discussing how they are going to take over the world's I.T. \n\nI once had a contract with one of the foreign companies, their foreign supervisor, wanted me to displace two American employees within their client company. Rarely will a foreign I.T. company hire an American. The one where I worked placed me into a special sub-company.

The longer OPT means that, the students can contribute more after they master the skills of working.\n\nSwallowing anything and everything has kept America in an invincible position for 200 hundred years, and now, I think extending the period of OPT provide real benefit for both of international students and America.\n\nBest regard!

If you take a look at all high-tech areas (such as silicon valley), the majority of contributors are not born in United States. They go to Colleges and Universities in United States to learn the most advanced knowledge. After they graduate, they stay here as STEM students and finally get authority to work here. Obviously, these generations of STEM students have made a great contribution to this nation.\n\nIf there is no OPT extension to the STEM students, this would be a disaster for United States for several reasons.\n\n1. There are hundreds and thousands of STEM students who have already found jobs at United States. They are making consistent contributions to the development of this country. Once the OPT extension is cancelled, they will be forced to leave this country immediately. All the high-tech companies in the United States will suffer from a big lose in this situation. As a result, they may lose the leadership in their areas and eventually United States may lose the leadership in the world.\n\n2. For the STEM students who are going to graduate in the near future, there is a high probability for them to go directly back to their home countries. They have learned the most advanced knowledge and technology in the world. However, United States cannot benefit anything from these students. In contrary, these students would go back to their home countries and help their home countries to catch up United States.\n\n3. For the students who plan to apply Colleges and Universities in United States, I believe they are attracted by not only the advanced knowledge but also the freedom and equality spirit in this country. They want to have a new life in United States, where people are judged only by their own efforts, but not their family. However, if STEM extension is cancelled, they would doubt the freedom and equality in this country. In addition, if eventually they have come back to their home countries, why would they pay a lot of tuition and come to United States?

Moreover, any increase in the STEM extension without a commensurate increase in the H1 B numbers will lead to a spiraling effect where the number of applications to the H1B guest worker program will increase exponentially each year. A simple scrutiny by the DHS into the avenues where current STEM OPT students work will easily reveal to them that a major fraction of them works in IT consulting firms, which in most cases, is not related to their field of study( a requirement of the STEM extension). A further increase in STEM extension only puts the genuine candidates at greater competition for visas, and allow the Indian body-shopping companies to continue importing cheap labor from abroad at the expense of American workers. Also, it is very unfair to other foreign workers who graduate in non STEM fields as it increases competition for the H1B visas. In my view, a general reform of the H1B program should be done before this program is increased to a 24 month extension. Steps like the administrative burdens stated in the new rule are certainly welcome as the restrictions would go a long way to prevent bogus consulting firms from exploiting talented foreign students because of their immigrant status and help genuine students by reducing the competition in the guest worker visa program.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by R B", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18509", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Please implement this rule but allow Students who are on 17 month extension to take advantage of 6 more months without paying for it.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Pradeep Kilaru", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2601", "postedDate": "2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposal because of the following reasons:\n\n1. One big reason that International students came to United States to study is due to OPT, especially STEM OPT which allow them to work legally after study. If OPT was canceled or shortened, then a lot of them will go to other countries for study (i.e. UK, UK's master/phD program is shorter and cheaper in total; HK, HK's master/phD program is even shorter than UK), which makes US less attractive and will be a huge damage on US GDP and US economy.\n\n2. For thoes students who already in STEM OPT Extension, if STEM Extension is canceled or shortened, what should they do? So only longer STEM OPT is possible since it is impossible to cut so many employees who is already in STEM OPT extension.\n\n3. STEM as four of the hardest field of higher education requires tremendous hard work, talent, dedication to finish the study, especially for Master, and PhD programs. In other words, successful candidates possess unique talents and characters that can help US economy innovation, and help boost US exocomy prosperity. \n\n4. Currently, Corporate America is cutting hiring from OPT candidates due to a highly/crutial H1B lottery process. By extending H1B longer can help hiring managers make correct decisions without considering candidates nationalities/race/gender, and only focus on their core competitiveness,  which I believe is the spirit of EEO.\n\nTo sum up, extend STEM OPT can only be good to US economy since the first day international students landed US territory till they started to make contribution in Corporate America.

Reasons are listed as below.\n\n1. Students with STEM degrees are usually engaged in positions or industries that are more technical , the subject of which most American people don't really want to devote themselves into, such as computer programming, mathematics, physics, engineering. Things need to be done, and these students barely affect the employment of American people because of the citizenship restraints. For almost every company owned by American people or American Companies, if a position can be filed with a citizen, what's the odd that the company will choose a foreign student over the citizen? Very low, because of so many risks, the money and time for sponsorship, if they choose the foreign student, there's too much to worried about. So, do students with STEM degrees really affect American students' employment opportunity? No, they are actually filling up positions that no Americans would like to do. \n\n2. STEM regulation is the main reason why so many students from oversea come here, stimulating economy and making contribution to development of technology and academy. If the regulation fails, there will be much less people come to US to study, live or spend their money. Is this what we wanted for US? The effect of foreign people with talents dropping out will emerge in a few years, and this effect would do harm to the development of United States. Suppose you have a small business, like a small restaurant, a repair shop, or a bike rental store, do you or do you not want more people to do business with you? Are the stem students really hurting American people's interest? No! They are really helping!\n\n3. There are so many outstanding people in this country, who are the leaders, professionals, and experts in their business, academic circle, fields, or industries and who are not originally American citizens, but they are devoting their power to make America a better country. STEM students are part of the main force. We can't lose them!\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Amanda Stevenson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13342", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It's the diversity and non-discrimination that make the United States the most powerful country in the world, with the world's most advanced technology.

This is absolutely not correct as from my own experience, I have received the job offer from one of the largest Internet company in silicon valley, my salary is higher than most of the US students in my department. I can get a job offer not because I can be hired with lower salary but because of my engineering talent is a great fit for the company's need. (The high salary prove this)\n\n2. US is facing great competition and challenge from many other countries such as China and India, many of the recent International students graduated here in the US are precious talent resource for the keep demanding need from the STEM related companies in China. It can only make US less competitive if the US government does not provide a mechanism for the foreign students to find a path to work and contribute to the US economy after graduation. These talents will go back to their home country make US less competitive in terms of attracting best talents. This is definitely no good for the US in the long run.\n\n3. US is always built by immigrants, it is just because US is so open and would like to provide an opportunity to the people with good talents and intentions in the past make it the most dynamic and developed country in the world. Shut the door to the great talents just because they are foreign does not show the true spirit of US. Local US people should not be afraid of incoming competition. The world now is so globalized now, and many international companies in the US are willing to find good talents resources, no matter where they are from. They just want the best people.

These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students.\n\nThe problems that will arise by revoking OPT extension are:-\nAt rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00) will go other countries with OPT system.\nUS Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months.\nMost of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education\nStudents who are contributing to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00) will be lost.\n\nI strongly commend for this 24 months rule and would urge that a clear path to of absorbing and benefiting from International graduates should be rolled out.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Naresh  Padala", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8506", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Extend opt period for f-1 visa students", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by komali chowdary", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9048", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "     This is just one more unbelievable program by the federal government which will undercut the wages and benefits of American workers in-order to increase profits for major corporations.

These days universities in the USA are having more and more masters and PhDs in the STEM field. In my universities and many others, graduate students in STEM are mostly from other countries other than the USA. This at least has two very important implications. Firstly, universities earn money from these students' tuition fee, which takes a huge part of the universities' entire revenue. Secondly, not many USA students want to take advanced study or do research in STEM, while it might be true that there might still exist many undergradudate american students. Just take a look at the departments like ECE, CS, etc. there are so many grad students as well as professors from other countries. If this new STEM OPT rule could not be issued, universities will lose huge amount of international students, thereby losing money as well as talented individuals. \n\n2. Continuing from the last point. If fewer and fewer international students are willing to come  to study in USA, those tech companies will have a difficult time to hire qualified workers. It is true that many undergrad american students are from STEM, but lots of positions require master or PhD level of education. What will those tech companies do then? Well, they still have lots of options, they can for example hire talented individuals from overseas, and apply L1 visa, or H1B visa for them every year. So the H1B visa lottery will become more competitive, which is absolutely unfair to those hardworking international students from USA universities.  Also, It is definitely NOT true that because of the OPT STEM rule, so many american workers are out of jobs. Companies only hire qualified workers, to make money for them. Since there are not enough american STEM students have master or PhD degrees, companies will not hire them only because they are americans. Big tech companies will definitely look for more talented people from overseas. \n\n3. International students already have lots of disadvantages when looking for jobs. Many positions require US citizenship, and also lots of companies don't provide Visa sponsorship at all. So international students can only apply jobs at those really big tech companies, such as Goolge, Amazon, etc. For those big tech companies, they will pay every one equally, no matter where that guy comes from. And every one has the same opportunity to get the job, as long as they are good enough. It is nonsense that many under educated americans think these companies are more willing to hire foreign students because they are cheaper, or think americans has disadvantages when applying these jobs.  \n\nTherefore, because of the fact that international students take a large part of the STEM field in the graduate education level, and many companies are hiring these students, it is absolutely significant to expand the OPT duration, this is really a win-win situation, for both these students or workers, and for the companies, and the US economy as well. Otherwise, many talents will be forced to leave, companies will be forced to hire people from overseas to work around. Universities will lose money and smart students. The whole US economy will have serious negative impacts, if those companies could not hire enough good workers.

The following are but a few. \n\nIII. Executive Summary\nA. Purpose of the Regulatory Action\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school  thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school.   Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.  \n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months, which is nobodys definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself  48 months is the course of study.  A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B  thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker  WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of [] employment.  Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students. \n[NOTE: U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.] \n\nG. Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields. \nTo guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. This is deceptive. The Regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S. worker. The Regulation deflect the issue away from  this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world.  Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers  with  no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student. \n \nThe Regulations define  similarly situated as \nU.S. workers in other employers [not other employees of the same employer] of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area [which will be strictly construed] of employment. Similarly situated U.S. workers would include U.S. workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the STEM OPT student.\nIn Short  By Definition There Are No Similarly Situated U.S. Workers Ensuring That No One Will Meet This Definition So The Employer Can Never Be Liable For Replacing Any U.S. Worker.\n\nIn addition an employer is to monitor and record his own actions by attestation in the Mentoring and Training Plan. This Regulation is designed to harm U.S. workers because it leaves the  FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE.]  The employer would also be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.\nThis Regulation is designed to leave the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers thus, giving the employer an excuse/alibi to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign student.  \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Otto", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1394", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The American labor force is sitting around collecting checks from me and your constituents.

If there is no chance of paying back the loans, I would expect a significant fall in the number of such students, in the end these students are creating a huge market in the states, paying for school, eating, living, entertainment ...\n\n- Most of the time it is claimed that we, immigrants, are the highly talented people but is it really the case? I can understand this for people who got accepted to PhD programs but for the rest, most of the time, it is just if you pay you get into the school. And since the extra money being paid by immigrants to these schools are significant sources of funding for universities, they tend to accept immigrants with ease. Except PhD graduates, these reasons would eliminate the claim that STEM candidate immigrants are highly talented people.\n\n- The companies are paying less taxes for STEM employees which reduces the cost of hiring immigrants. For sure there are risks involved with hiring STEM people like them being out of status in the middle of an important project BUT how many of these people are working in this long term projects? Most of the time the high tech industry don't let STEM workers be involved in long term projects. If a chance for 36 months of granted OPT is given, the companies would just keep hiring immigrants and this would help them avoid paying much more money to more experienced fellows, most of the time American citizens because immigrants leave the country at some point. We all know that if person A and B are capable of doing the work, the one who costs less will be hired.\n\n- The ethnic diversity of USA should be considered as well. We all know that most of the so called 'natural born citizens', 'US citizens' who claim they should have higher priorities were immigrants at some point most likely immigrated from Europe. Hence just saying that immigrants shouldn't be preferred over citizens just based on citizenship is nonsense, their ancestors were immigrants as well, that is how US is built, not a national country but a diverse one. What should be done for this concern is that the government should decide when to stop letting immigrants in and stop making them citizens with time. Even though I am an immigrant, I don't think that I would like having this much immigrants especially at the highly paid industries at my own country. If the government doesn't think that there are enough citizens to take care of this industry, then this STEM extension is a nice opportunity to get more immigrants into the system.\n\n- There is also the fact that STEM immigrants are preferred over citizens because they can't oppose their employer. Who would risk his/her visa status? I have heard this many times: \"I need to be patient until I get my Green Card\". This alone shows that immigrants are easier to be turned into highly paid modern slaves. At some point a citizen might leave the company because of some management issues but an immigrant can't because they have to wait for Green Card which makes them perfect candidates for high tech companies. As we all know these companies just want to make profit, hence instead of people who would work 40 hours per week, they would hire people who can be pushed to work 50 or more hours with the same salary to guarantee their visa status.\n\n- Another problem is that this OPT is supposed to give the students a short industry experience to complete their education. But now, we are discussing the ways extending to citizenship. How much sense does this make? Having 3 years of OPT almost ensures that these people will get H1Bs and will have 6 more years to work in the states. If we assume 1/3 of H1B applications are approved, with this new rule, an immigrant will have a 70 percent chance of getting H1B. I would consider this a significant obstacle for US citizen STEM candidates.\n\n- I tried to be objective till this point. From now on I will type how I feel about the proposed rule as an immigrant. This is a great opportunity for me to stay in the states in the long term. I am making lots of money, I am living in one of the most developed countries on earth. The money I make here is worth dozens more in my country. With the new proposed rule, I strongly believe that the path to become a citizen is very straight and clear. I will be paying my taxes and covering my expenses and these are benefits for US. \n\nTo summarize, If I were to think in favor of US citizens, I would strongly oppose the rule. If I am to consider the benefits of immigrants and disregard citizens, I would strongly support the rule and I would demand any 'X' more years of OPT extension!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by faruk yavuz", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22499", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I heartily welcome this proposed extension for students who are currently on OPT and greatly benefit from this additional STEM extension.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous (M.

However, we all have to admit that there is not enough American citizens who choose or are able to take this kind of jobs. The nonimmigrant STEM students solve the critical issue of high technology worker shortage in this country. They contribute to the development of the technology and economy of this country and keep the United States as the leading country of high technology. The point is that the nonimmigrant STEM students DO NOT take away American Citizen's jobs, there is not enough workers for this kind of jobs in this country, so the nonimmigrant STEM students fill in. They are doing jobs that most American Citizens do not or cannot do. Even if they don't take these jobs, there won't be more job available for most American citizens.\nSecondly, think about it, what makes America the NO.1 country in the world? It is because the American value is about openness, tolerance, freedom and equality. This draws the most brilliant people from all over the world to work for this country. They are the elites in Science and Engineering. They made the United States the leading country of the development of Science and technology, and Science and technology are what made the United States the most powerful country in the world. The value of this country is about freedom, openness and equality, not close-minded, over-protected, and discrimination against foreigners. Do Not forget, the United States is an immigration country, and just because it is an immigration country, there is always fresh blood filling in, so the country is alive and energetic. If the country follows some shot-sighted people's opinion and chase the brilliant and excellent foreign students away, there would be less and less excellent scientists and engineers want to come to the United States, the effect of this action and the loss it causes to this country would be inestimable! \nAll in all, the extension of OPT for nonimmigrant STEM students will not affect American citizen's job opportunities, on the other hand they are doing jobs that supports the country's technology industry but most American citizens do not or can not do. There is the worker shortage for the technology companies and that is why OPT exists at the first place. And OPT for non-immigrant STEM students solve this critical issue. Furthermore, the brilliant foreign students contribute significantly to the development of science and technology in this country. One year OPT is too short for anyone in science and technology to even finish one project in research or in a company. We all know that this kind of work needs a lot of time and efforts to make progress in the project. After the basic training, there is not enough time for an OPT student to finish a good project for the company. For the sake of the technology companies, the extension of OPT is seriously needed. Chasing away the foreign students would not help the citizens get more jobs.

From what I learned by researching, the U.S. was under economic depression and they want to keep the talents that American education system trained so that they could contribute to the economy.\n\nThe U.S. economy is recovering in the recent years partly because it's a world known impression that the U.S. is the best place for people around the world that who have talent and want to pursue their dreams.

I am holding a Master of Science degree in Computer Science conferred by University of Southern California. \n\nActing as the lead developer of the team, I have designed most of the architecture of both the front facing app as well as the backend logic of our company's next major web platform. In addition, I have also participated in our company's hiring process and given interviews to quite a number of American as well as international candidates.  \n\nFirst, like my international friends in my department my salary is roughly at the same level compared to American engineers.  Most of the concern over unfair competition stemming from the fact that companies pay lower salary to us than to similar American engineers is not true in software industry.\n\nSecond, since I have had first hand experience with hiring software engineer. I am more than qualified to assess the talent of STEM international students compared to that of American students. I would like to say that it is indeed true that international students having similar background as I have are generally more talented than the American counterpart. The reason is that most international students coming to US to study STEM subjects are top-tier students in their countries. It is a boon for US to have these top talents to help boost the development of science and technology of America and in turn American economy as well as its competitiveness in the world.\n\nThird, compared to the vast pool of jobs, the effect of adding a handful of foreign students does not affect the job opportunity of the general Americans. Based on my observation in participating the engineering hiring process, they are losing their jobs not because of that we have robbed their jobs but that they lack of competitiveness in terms of mathematical and technological skills. For those Americans who are equally or more talented than the international students usually get way more job offers!\n\nIn all measures, my contribution to my current company is significant. Because that the size of my company is small, it is probably harder to attract an American engineer like me since he/she would have been at a much better position in the job market and hence aimed much higher given those talents I possess. It is precisely because that people like me who are talented but are under valued in the job market, so many startups and medium sized companies here have the chance to acquire top of the line talents.\n\nThe opportunity of working in America as a STEM student for three years is substantial for us regardless of whether or not we are able to stay afterwards. And this opportunity will keep America being attractive to international talents. We are chasing our American dreams and America will become a better and stronger nation because of our contribution. Albert Einstein, Von Neumann, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Henry Kissinger were all born outside of America.

And international students do not have any privilege in job market because they are not CITIZEN, most companies will turn down international students because they are not willing to go through the hassle of applying work visa for them. So it's ridiculous to say that international students have taken US citizen's jobs, US citizenship has much more privilege than you think in US job market.\n\nIf one has to blame, blame on those consulting companies, they are the companies hiring labors overseas, and sell their work at much lower price than local wage. They are the companies took most of H1B applications and harmful for US economics in the long run. International students who completes degree on the US continent, are different, they only need OPT to work, and their jobs are regular jobs from US companies, not those shady consulting companies. \n\nPlease reconsider the contribution from international students for US economy, and distinguish F-1 students from consulting companies' workers.

I wanted to highlight how the stem opt extension personally played an important role in my life. I currently work for a private corporation after finishing my Ph.D. In biomedical engineering. I do R&D of medical devices used in diagnostic and treatment of lung cancer. The products I develop helps millions of people across the world including American citizens. \n\nMedical devices is a highly regulated industry and often it takes couple of years to successfully launch a product. Thereby the proposed extension will allow people like me to stay longer and get the practical training on successfully launching products in the market.  Also, most development projects are done on a yearly basis. So extending the opt to 24 months helps people like to me to stay for 3 complete physical years, rather than leaving a project in the middle of development. \n\nAlso, I want to emphasize the positive impact, students on opt like me bring to American economy. Personally, I am responsible for brining 2 projects to my company in US, which are traditionally done in our company headquarters in Japan. This lead our company to hire 2 additional people to support the projects. Also, these additional projects prevented one of our contract companies in US going defunct. \n\nI also want the proposed rule to allow students who have entered their 60 day grace period to take advantage of the proposed extension. Roughly, 18000 students are already in STEM extension and it is unfair to a fraction of them to miss out the chance to get the remaining 7 months because of the regulatory time involved in publishing a final rule. If the final rule takes into effect on Feb 15, students whose 17 month extension ends on that date cannot take advantage of this rule because it will be nearly impossible to get all the required documents approved by the end of their extension. Therefore I urge the DHS to consider including the students in their 60 day grace period. \n\nIn summary, I personally benefitted from the STEM extension. The training I obtained after my graduation, helped to gain necessary experience and confidence that I can use to work in any part of the world. \n\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sujeeth Parthiban", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2282", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think opt STEM extension is necessary for F-1 stidents.

International students, coming from different countries pursue Higher education in the US because of various reasons, one of which is the great education system of US. Students are exposed to state of art technologies, where they can practice theoretical concepts and work with equally competitive peers. As soon as they graduate, most of the students prefer to work for the industry, where they get a chance to expose themselves to practical implementations of theoretical concepts. Industry needs talented people to work for them, and talent can easily be honed at Universities because of the academic ambience and the diversity it offers.  Not all countries have the cutting edge infrastructure and technologies that US has. If international students do not get a chance to practice whatever they learnt in a School, I don't think they'll opt US as a destination for higher education.\n\n2. Industries in US work in close collaboration with Educational Institutes to develop cutting edge technologies, which is the future of US. Most of the international students will stop coming to US, if they do not find any prospects after higher education. In that case, innovation driven industry which works with the Educational Institutes will be short of talented pool. This will eventually affect US economy.

As you can see, the H1B VISA is becoming harder and harder to win the draw and this rule for OPT Extension will give us more chance to try to get H1B VISA. I heard that some people are worried about if we international students are taking over the job opportunities. I don't think that is true because we are highly educated and as far as I know, most of international students who can find jobs, they are very talent and intelligent and hardworking. The more educated people work for US, the better economy US will gain. We all say that everyone is equal and free in US, so this rule only provides an equal opportunity for us to compete with others. It's not like this rule is providing every international student a job. It still all depends on each individual's ability to get a job. If you cannot get a job, even if OPT Extension is set to be 10 years, it still means nothing.\n\nFor myself, I cannot work anymore if the current OPT Extension expires in Feb, 2016. However, I talked to my company and they are very worried because it is not easy for them to hire another engineer to replace me because I have my master's and experience. Also, the place I'm working is a very small town. Not many young people will want to come and live here. Also, I've got my both bachelor's and master's in the US, I have gotten used to work with the US engineering system.

Therefore, if this rule cannot be approved. It's hurting me, my company as well as the US, very badly. Just think about how many contributions the international students are making for the United States, and you won't be even willing to give us a little more time to deal with the legal status so we can serve the US more?

That initiative particularly focused on enhancing our nation's economic, scientific and technological competitiveness by finding new ways to encourage talented international students to become involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States.

International students have to pay much more tuition to get the exact same education as local students.

What the country lose is the most \nrequired people among them. Personally, I think this will bring great loss to the US.\n2.

As far as I am concerned, \nsmall companies are not always friendly to international students because they have to help them get H1B which will waste \nmanagers a lot of time. But big companies such as Google, Apple, who hire qualified people no matter you are American citizen\n or not, Being able to work well is the first priority. International students really work hard to get those opportunities.

And here are my reasons:\n\n1. OPT students will benefit from this. With extended time OPT student can gain more experience in the related field. And they will have a better chance to build a better career which will impact their entire life. And this will, in the long run, benefit their family, their children and their country. With the time extended they will also have more time to think about the next step, either continue in the industry or pursue a higher degree.\n\n2. OPT students make great contribution to the goverment, their company and even more. I work as a engineer in a tech company. Our team has a total of 7 people and 5 of them are either currently working using their OPT extention or uesed to be working under OPT. They contributes to 70% of the human resources in our team. And each year they can contribute up to 30% of their input to the federal as tax. From our company's perspective without OPT we would spent more time and money trying to recruit qulified employee from our sources or we would end up not having enough skilled engineers to power the whole comany. This great loss for the company means great loss for the customers of the company and our customers could be anybody in the nation. As whole OPT students plays an important role in boosting both the technological and economic development in the U.S.\n\n3. This rule will be a win-win for both existing U.S. citizens and OPT students. Competition does exists but will create a win-win situation as this kind of competition will raise the human resouce quilty in the U.S. Knowing the existence of the competition will help people to realize the need to improve their skill set constently. In the long term this will help to raise the level of the education across the whole country.\n\nFor more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed people from all around the globe, enhancing the diversity, culture and economy. And that is what makes the United States the UNITED STATES. And that is what keeps making it stronger and stronger.

This hard working and smartness brings more benefits to companies then its extra cost, and more talents to this country, which I think is only beneficial to America.\n\nI saw some comments posted complaining about cheap labor force from foreign countries in IT area stealing working opportunities from native Americans.

Indeed, some citizens are against this rule for the reason that many nonimmigrants take away their jobs. Some citizens may think this rule may cause citizens lost their way to feed themselves and their families. I have to admit that this reason may be right from their point of view. Since there are too many talented non-citizens and many companies want to hire talented and excellent people without thinking. If I am a citizen, of course, I also may oppose this rule. But I still have to objectively comment this extension rule. After all, I am an international student.\n\nI have three key reasons why I support this 24 months extension rule from my perspective. \n\nFirst, no matter what, OPT and CPT have become one of the most important reason why lots of students want to arrive USA to study, not just because USA has the best education level in the world. We all know that the tuitions in the USA colleges for non-citizens are very high, the majority of international students in fact are not wealthy. So many international student want to get a part-time or full-time job to relieve their economic pressures during their F1 period. And CPT and OPT exactly give them the precious opportunities to realize their value by trying a major related job. So that nearly 800000 international guys go to USA to be a college student per year. And I think these international students undoubtedly bring vitality to local economy. For examplethe banking benefitthe rental benefitthe service revenue benefitespecially the researching benefit that many researching institutes and colleges can get enough money from students tuitions and can be engaged in researching. Therefore, if the 24months extension rule goes into effect, I think more and more elites from the world will choose USA colleges as their studying destination. If not, from my own point of view, many international guys may want to choose another country for their future education and USA local economy may be affected more or less.\n\nSecond, some citizens say that the nonimmigrant has robbed their jobs. I do not agree, since the 24 extension months are only for the STEM majors. Like the CS and EE. But for many native people, they do not even know what is STEM and just say the international guys robbed our jobs. In my opinion, yes it is indeed USA native Jobs, but if not enough native guys want to focus on these majors and many companies also try to attract many talented people in these majors, why can we not try to find a part time or full time jobs associated with these STEM majors. To be honest, these stem majors are all very very hard. Many native students are not interested in these stem majors. This condition makes all USA colleges try their best to attract native students to study the stem majors and also give lots of offers to the international students. In addition, so many companies associated with the stem majors are all in dire need of talented students who are the stem major students. Because these companies all need creativity and that is the reason why they keep on hiring more and more young or experienced guys. Even the market associated with the stem majors is very big, the real talents guys are still very rare. If the 24 months rule is not passed. I personally think that it may bring a big pressure to the market of high-tech.\n\nThird, the last reason may be a little grandiose and no practical significance for someone, but I have to say. some native people just see us as nonimmigrants, some citizens even do not accept the immigrants, but I insist on thinking that one of the reason why USA is USA is that USA keep on encouraging many people to be excellent by unremitting effort, no matter where they from and who they are.  Some citizens oppose the new rule, and that may means they deny the unremitting effort spirit, they even can't tolerate other guys who are excellent and deny them only by the reason they are foreigners. I think the USA gov will make a correct decision at last. So I am confidence with the passing of the STEM extension rule.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ming Feng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11230", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "American citizens should get 1st chance at American STEM jobs and at good wages.

It allows U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who pursue a degree for at least nine months in the U.S.  This expands the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. That puts downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Further, the program entices employers to hire foreign students because they don't pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\nI repeat, I oppose expanding the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion allows U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this create an incentive to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it violates the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens\nHomeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\nThe Optional Practical Training program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training to benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael Johnson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7086", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This will be a really big help to all the international students on F-1 visa.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Nipun Sher", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0865", "postedDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal.

For instance, a commenter stated that demand for technical workers was very weak in engineering occupations and growing modestly in computing and mathematics occupations. The same commenter stated that, especially when combined with H-1B, L-1, and other skilled workers, the number of students taking advantage of the STEM OPT extension would distort the domestic labor market. Some commenters specifically stated that employers would prefer to hire F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions because these students would work for lower wages. Some commenters noted that some U.S. firms had previously advertised STEM positions as being available only to OPT students. Commenters requested that DHS consider written reports, testimony, and other sources describing the state of the U.S. STEM workforce. Commenters also questioned the veracity of studies and reports cited in the preamble to the 2008 IFR, and some questioned whether DHS had interpreted that information correctly in assessing the then-prevailing STEM labor market. Some commenters stated that the STEM OPT extension was contrary to the academic purpose of the F-1 statute. In general, commenters who made these and similar points requested that DHS eliminate the STEM OPT extension and the Cap Gap provision in their entirety.\nDHS's initial assessment, consistent with many of the public comments and following consultation with the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor, is that the direct benefit to the academic experience resulting from the STEM OPT extension is significant, and that on the whole, positive indirect effects on educational institutions and academic exchange support the availability of a STEM OPT extension at this time. Nevertheless, DHS recognizes the concerns expressed above and proposes to modify the terms and conditions for employer participation in the STEM OPT extension in order to protect U.S. workers from possible employer abuses of these programs.\nFor instance, any employer wishing to hire a student participating in the STEM OPT extension would, as part of a newly required Mentoring and Training Plan, be required to sign a sworn attestation affirming that, among other things: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives. As with all affirmations contained in the Mentoring and Training Plan, the employer would attest that these commitments are true and correct to the best of the employer's knowledge, information and belief.\nAdditionally, the proposed rule would require that the terms and conditions of an employer's STEM practical training opportunityincluding duties, hours and compensation [56] be commensurate with those provided to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers. Work duties must be designed to assist the student with continued learning and satisfy the existing ICE guidelines for work hours when participating in post-completion OPT, which are set at a minimum of 20 hours per week, and would be so defined under this proposed rule. [57] If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers, the employer would be required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment. Similarly situated U.S. workers would include U.S. workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the STEM OPT student. The student's compensation would be reported on the Mentoring and Training Plan and the student would be responsible for reporting any adjustments. DHS requests public comment, especially from employers and labor organizations, on all aspects of this provision, including the types of business factors employers would use to evaluate whether their workers are similarly situated.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by weibin zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12049", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal as an international student who has study experiences in US and Australia. The reasons are as followed:\n1.Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students.\nIn April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of internationalstudents in the program more than doubled its 2008 total.  In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022.\n2.I choose to study in US because there are more good working opportunities than any other countries in the world. But without OPT extension, it's meaningless to study in US: I can get better chance in other countries. I paid more than 30k dollars per year on my tuition fee now, if I can not gain working experience for more than a year, why I choose to pay that much to US?? So as you can see, if I thought that way, a lot of international student will think in that way too. So if you decided to cancel the OPT extension, the economy in college will be effected a lot!!!(As far as I know, students inside my state only pay less than 10k per year for their intuition fee). If university is lack of money support from international student, maybe no funding will be distributed to new technology program and this will definitely effect the future of an university. Also, many excellent professor will choose to find another job and that will be a huge loss for education in US!!!!!\n3. Rejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for.

China and India are still much poorer than the U.S, and engineers can earn much less in China/India than in the U.S., even same amount of value are made by them. So, if given a choice, most of them will be very happy to work for American people.Every time ONE Chinese genius decide to work for USA rather than for China, we got TWO more genius than China.With great help from English European genius in 1800s (thanks to the peacelessness on their continent), USA become the most largest industrialized country; with great help from German genius during and after WWII (thanks again to the peacelessness on their continent), USA became the superpower in the west. With great help from Russian genius in 1990s(thanks to the chaos after the Soviet collapse), USA has successfully kept its position as the only superpower on the planet. Today, facing the challenge from the east, where is as peaceful and active as the America, if we do not actively attract their genius, we may fail in keeping the glory of our great country in the following decades.God bless us, because we are now in the right way to defense our superpower.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Grace Salonga", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15744", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the OPT extension.\n\nFirst of all, OPT extension is a very important reason that international students choose US for further education.

At the same time when the same job is offered to someone without Master's degree might require more training and investment.

I'm an international graduate student from China and will be working in the U.S. soon. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.\n. From 1point 3acres bbs\nSTEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. As a master student, I have had offers from U.S., UK and Germany when applying for graduate school. I came to U.S. because I believe it will better prepare me for a professional career in the OPT and the extension period. Though tuition in U.S., especially in private school, is  huge amount of money, I still feel it worthwhile if I am able to develop professional skills, and also to have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry because I will have excellent resume to bring back to China. One year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.\n\n12-months seems not enough for foreign students to gain enough work experience. For example, some school doesnt have CPT. And if students want to have an internship to get to know more about the industry, they would have used 3 month on internship. And after that, if they feel really interested in working in the  industry in U.S. they would like to seek a full time position. Some companies spend a few month training fresh graduates, so it will only be a few months left for foreign students to contribute professional skills to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company. \n\nIn addition, I believe U.S. employers will benefit from the knowledge, not only professional skills, but also customs and languages of  their own countries from STEM OPT students, and this will give the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast. For example, the Uber China Growth team and TripAdvisor China team will surely need to know more about local market.

But this isn't directly related to the H1B/green card. This STEM extension only puts STEM students in a more time-favorable position in acquiring the H1B visa through the now fiercely competitive lottery. WITHOUT the STEM extension program, the majority of STEM postgraduates working in the US will be replaced by non-STEM counterparts such as law and commerce majors within a year due to the limited number of H1B visas, which, shouldn't be what the country really needs. America owes its success today due in large to being able to attract world-class scientists and engineers, who would be considered STEM postgraduates. Given the limited number of H1B visas, I think it would be crucially beneficial for the country to spend those visas preferably on those individuals who possess talented skills in science. And this should be a very good reason for proposing the STEM extension. The majority of STEM postgraduates are talents from across the world, and thus an invaluable asset that America shouldn't miss. Without the STEM extension, STEM students, especially those with PhD degrees will be treated equally as other non-STEMs, which will also greatly discourage themselves and their successors.\n\nSecond, in my own case as a future postdoc, with/without the OPT STEM extension does make a lot of difference. Without the STEM extension, postdocs almost have to acquire H1B or J visas from their PIs within a year. But quite a few investigators are not willing to support postdocs with H1B visas immediately upon employment. With the STEM extension, postdocs, at least in my field would have less stress during their research upon graduation. A portion of them would also be able to do volenteer research work.\n\nThird, my wife is also a STEM major working in a pharmaceutical company. In her experience, most companies would need to train their fresh employees for at least half a year in order to get them aquanted with their professionals. Without the STEM extension, many international STEM employees, which actually make up the majority of the industry (mostly because they are better professionally qualified) would be forced to leave the position within just half a year of their formal working experience.

The students who are in the OPT STEM Extension program will not take over citizens' jobs.   Drive the international students out may bring some more work opportunities to citizen in a short time, however, many American people do not like the STEM area and they are willing to work in other fields. The needs for scientific and engineering area in industry are much more than supply. For example, in my current company which located in Dallas,TX, I am an Algorithm Engineer, most of my team members are international people. They are diligent and professional. Similar situation in our software department. Most of them are Phds in software engineering,electrical engineering, optical engineering and mechanical engineering.\nRecently some members left our company and we need to hire more people in software department and also other departments which is not related to scientific and engineering area. But until now, since 5 months passed, there are no citizens to come for software interview. They are more willing to do other jobs than coding. In this situation, the remaining members who are international students in software department are working very hard to meet the requirements before their deadline. So I think, the students who are in the OPT STEM Extension program will not take over citizens' jobs. In contrast, they are do good help to technical industry and make their contribution to society.\n\n\n2.

Until there is truly a shortage of STEM graduates, there should NOT be an effort to make it easier for foreigners to stay/work here. Instead, the timeframe they are allowed to work in this country should be reduced. Ideally, they would get their degree here and then return to their country to improve it. From what I understand, companies are hiring foreign nationals because they are cheaper which results in depressed wages for others, are willing to work ridiculously long hours, and not \"make waves\". These are not character traits that will make this country strong and dynamic but will enrich American executives - to the detriment of the US children, raised with American values and work/social ethics.

In case you don't understand the number:\n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.On top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. Rejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for.

However, the OPT extension will, in fact, contribute to the well-being of American citizens for the following reasons:\n\n1. The OPT extension rule will attract far more international students to America. Only a small portion of these students will eventually stay. Most students benefit the US economy by paying a huge amount for housing, tuition, food, service, etc and leave the US after graduation. \n\n2. The US high-tech industry is driven by admitting highly-skilled foreign workers. In major US universities, there are a large number of foreign faculties. They are dedicated to research and develop new technologies which make the US the most innovative country in the world. US technology giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft rely on highly-skilled international employees to stay on top of the competition. The American-only labour force will not be able to satisfy the need of the Universities and high-tech companies. They need foreign workers to have enough resource to keep the US economy youthful and full of potential. \n\n3. Some people might believe that OPT extension will allow companies to hire international students for a lower wage which leads to a decrease of benefit and job opportunity for US citizens. However, this is completely untrue. US companies are NOT allowed to hire an international student instead of a US citizen for a lower wage. As a matter of fact, it is much harder for an international STEM student to find a job than an American STEM student. International students have cultural and communications barriers which put them at a much lower hand during interviews. Furthermore, most companies prefer American students over international students because they do not want to go through the extremely complicated and unpredictable process of H1b application. Last but most importantly, in order to sponsor an international student, the employer will have to open the job to American citizens first. Only if no suitable American candidate is found can this position be awarded to an international student. \n\n4. Most highly-educated and intelligent international students in the STEM field rely on the OPT extension to work in the United States. Once they obtain the working visa, they will be able to contribute greatly to the tax income of US government, research and develop cutting-edge technologies and diversify the society. Countries that shut their doors to highly-skilled foreign workers ended up suffering from the stagnation of the economy. America relies on the introduction of foreign workers to continue to be the greatest.\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuhao Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15776", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Student with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 students is really really necessary and right decision to make!

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\n2.\"\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\n3.\"\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\n4.\"\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nAND FINALLY-Just when you think this administration has finally reached the last straw of its destruction of its own citizens they add yet another dot to be connected to tell us just who's team The Obama administration is truly on!

And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.\n\nAfter reviewing so many negative comments who object the proposed rule. I found something they have in common: they are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the stem industries.\nI don't think they have to worry about this at all. First and foremost, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. And OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. And those tech companies is risking potential loss of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles?\n\nSo, if those people really need something to worry about, this is what they are supposed to worry about: why not spending more time improving their own skills set those companies are looking for instead of wasting time leaving negative comments here? Competitions are everywhere in the world. Tech companies will never hire you if you are not qualified regardless of your citizenship! Only the strong survive!\nAs for the argument that foreign Students take away jobs and do not pay tax. I want to dispute that foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help local economies.

Two positive aspects that I have in mind would be that: first, the direct result from this extension is that it increases the chance for the graduates to receive a working visa (H1B), allowing them to work for longer time period for US employers. Every year, the US universities spent plenty of money and resources in the education and training for international students, especially true for student pursuing advanced degrees. Shortening the OPT which potentially reduces the chance that these student could work for US employer would be a significant loss of the resources. Second, this will make the job market more competitive. Not only the employers have more options in hiring the best candidate but also the extension give the employer more time to effectively evaluate the performance of the hired international students.\n\nUS has been a country comprised of immigrants and is always absorbing talented people from all over the world. This is what made US to what it is so far. If shortening OPT, as some organizations or individuals asserted, is used to protect the domestic job market, I will have say it is neither a smart nor an effective move.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or master's degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries.

That is the reason why the U.S. is thriving and prosperous as it is today. One thing for sure is that the STEM international graduates are the POSITIVE elements to the development of society.\n\nI saw people saying the international workers are grabbing the working opportunity of the citizen of united states. One point I want to mention is that today is not agriculture age, a unit of area could only feed one farmer. Today is era of science and technology, STEM graduates will not grab so called working opportunities. The graduate who was learning electrical engineering can never stole a work from a cook or a bank clerk. (No offense, just an example). Instead, he/ she will shine and contribute in electrical engineering field---energy, electronics, the most fundamental but important fields of the operation of a society. In fact, the market have so much need for high tech person that even if they hire both internationals and domestics, the needs for the positions is still strong. Look at the ratio of co-workers around you. With conscious.\n\nThe other point I want to mention is that, it is every enterprise's right to pick up the best employee for themselves. The reason why international graduates get job is because they are the, say, most fit person for the job, they are the best. They are doing the work with such high quality that they are the ones who are most qualified. Why take away the rights and opportunities from the ones who are the most fit? Put someone who is less qualified and skilled can never be the solution, and it will not be, if the society or enterprise wants to have a positive development.\n\nIt goes without saying the OPT extension for STEM graduate is very important, in fact it is not only important for the students, it is also critical to the companies who hire them. No one likes job hopper. No one likes to see their best and most potential entry level employee has to leave the company because the law does not allow them, to even give it a try because they have no enough time, even if they did nothing but working hard. This could only leads to a total waste of investment from the company side, as well as a lost of intellectual resources. And it will let the international students who are currently studying in college lose hope.\n\nAll in all, push away the good ones is not the solution. Everyone has the right to fight and working hard for his/her dream, no matter what is his/her national origin, and everyone needs time to show its value---the OPT extension for STEM graduates.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lining Dong", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15275", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Among pros and cons, Giving opportunity to those talanted people, let them work for the U.S.,it's a wise option because they can bring positive impact to professional field, create more economic value.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alice Lowrey", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3603", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new ruling. \n1. OPT program is directly related to US educational institutions and is fundamentally a selling point of the US educational market. A lot of people come to the US rather than go to other countries because of this benefit. If the extension was canceled, then it would be a threat to the US educational institutions financially. No one would ever want to bring CASH to the country anymore in exchange of education. The extension, to some degree, is a basic sales strategy that has worked well. \n2. US higher education has been long short of enough students to do research. If the attractiveness of US education went down because of the cancellation of the extension, then the US research and high tech would be the first victim. US will lose its biggest advantage over other countries and will eventually lose its power. \n3. People cannot equate OPT with the general immigration problem. OPT is very restrictive - only granted to those who have studied in a US institution. It is not even immigration. It is funny that US allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come to this country for free but does not give qualified people who are anxious in creating value for the United States to stay. \n4 Some mentioned that US does not have a shortage of stem workers, which is so untrue. The companies not only need stem workers, but truly qualified skilled workers. A master student who have been in the university for 6 years is not the same as someone who attend a training course for 3 months. The poor high school stem education prevents the universities to produce enough skilled workers. . from: 1point3acres.com/bbs \n5. If people do not have the right skill set but blame just those F1 students for taking their jobs, I do not see any hope in this country. Even the F1 students all left after graduation, the companies would just hire them overseas instead of hiring locals who are not capable of doing the job. \n6. The rule is exactly there to solve the low wage problem. The wages for a lot of PhDs and Masters are the same or even higher than the US citizen. Only some other programs(ICC who abused the H1B program) may allow hiring unskilled workers from overseas. OPT is the wrong target if people really want to make sure that companies do not hire foreign nationals for lower cost. US citizens should be smart enough to have the right judgement for this issue, right? \n7. OPT, even not a direct immigration issue, can also be related to immigration. OPT is itself a filter and will filter out people who are not good enough, as a three year period of working in a company is the best exam a student can take to prove his/her abilities. Those who are not good enough will get fired and go home. But those who can stay will have the option to either stay or leave after the end of the OPT period. The US government do not have to spend all the time and money and labor to come up with metrics to evaluate if an applicant is qualified for citizenship. Furthermore, a country needs immigrants, period. This is a fundamental economic rule that exists in nature. The two important driving force for economy are population and technology. Population-wise, companies needs demand to produce. Wont people eat and rent houses and buy stuff and spend money here and there after they start working under OPT? Why do people only see OPT worker taking jobs, but not see the other aspects? Remember the financial crisis in the 1930s? Nobody wanted to buy stuff, and companies had to stop producing, and so laying off workers. Technology-wise, I think enough has been mentioned about how immigrants contribute to research and product development.\n8. If students who are studying in the US all go back to their country after 1years of training, they will soon create value for their countries that will one day compete with the US companies. The US uses its own education to nurture its competitors? \n9. The fundamental reason for the extension to be 24 months is that a lot projects are 2~3 years long. It would be very much a trouble for companies to switch among different workers for the projects.\nIn summary, I think OPT extension is not a threat to the US and US citizens, but rather a benefit for exactly the US universities, companies, economy(and therefore for each individual.) Particularly, this very ruling is exactly out there to address people's concerns about abusing the OPT program and to make sure the OPT program will not become a drain for US jobs.

As an international student, even with a PhD degree, it is difficult to find a job immediately especially for Mechanical Engineering. This is because most of the jobs in Mechanical Engineering in the US have a requirement of US citizenship. Usually it takes more than 1 year to find a full-time job with probably an internship first as far as I know in my school. Even though some people got a full-time job after several months, some of the companies simply don't support H1B application so people have to re-apply jobs at the same time so it takes more time to finally be admitted into a company who would like to support H1B. Assuming one lucky student got into a company supporting H1B soon after graduation, usually with 12 month OPT, only one lottery can be made which means the student probably still won't get a H1B.\n\nApparently with longer extensions of OPT, the possibility of getting a job and H1B support increases. I believe many excellent students in Mechanical Engineering want to find a job in the US because they believe that they can make a good contribution to the area. However, if without OPT extension, many people would have to leave at some point because of the status issue.\n\nPersonally, I would like to find a job in the US after graduation because what I learnt in the Graduate School could be further sharped in the industry of US which I believe is also what the US want: high educated international students work for the country. With only 12 months OPT, I think it is very difficult for me to get a H1B lottery which greatly reduce the possibility of finding a job here. \n\nIn summary, I would support the extension of OPT for STEM students to be longer.

Hence, I feel obliged to submit a formal comment to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) regarding the proposed rulemaking.\n\nI strongly support the concept of Optional Practical Training (OPT) and support the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors for the following reasons:\n\n1. It allows graduates from US universities to gain experience related to their major field of study and thus helping the United States to retain top talent and providing opportunities for students to contribute to the economic prosperity of the nation. \n\n2. Our brilliant graduates from various universities working in STEM fields have been major contributors in the country's ability to be a top-notch technology innovator. Letting students to leave the country will seriously disrupt the technology sector and create a shortage of talent for enterprises to innovate.\n\n3. Furthermore, this disruption could cause students from all over the world to choose a different country to pursue their dreams of education seriously affecting the ability of US universities to pursue research, which is a major driver of innovation in the technology sector.\n\nBecause of the above reasons, I urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE to continue working quickly to ensure that no disruption would be caused due to the recent court actions requiring the rule to go into effect before the the February 12, 2016 deadline.\n\nHowever, I am also concerned with the extra administrative burdens placed on employers through the Mentorship Training Program that may potentially deter employment of F-1 STEM students. While a formal mentoring plan is applaudable, the strict attestment requirement from employers may have serious negative effect on hiring STEM students, especially by small companies that lack legal and administrative resources. \nAlso, since the Mentorship Training Program is required to be supervised by the Designated School Official (DSO) for each student, this will also put additional burden on the universities, which may not have enough resources to carry out the responsibility without causing delays in the process.\n\nI therefore request the DHS and ICE to look for viable alternatives that will reduce administrative burden on both the employer and the universities.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule-making and thank you for all your hard work.\n\nRegards,\nJatin Pai\nComputer Engineering Graduate Student\nArizona State University\nContact: jvpai@asu.edu\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jatin Pai", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20519", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Gentlemen:  Please don't allow foreigners to take any more American jobs.

Many people think the increasing number of foreign employees will result in unfairly low wage. However, according to the US news data, this is not the truth at all. I worked as a teaching assistant for three years while in university. Therefore, I can easily tell that since 2011, the ratio of international student in my major computer science was greatly increasing. Before 2011, the sections I taught may only have three or four international students out of 24. However, after 2011, it was very common to see eight or nice or even more international students in my sections. According to their theory, the average wage should be lower and lower, or at least stopped growing. However, from the data on US news (http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/computer-programmer/salary), we can easily tell that the average salary was growing well. Especially, after 2010, it became even much better. \n\nSo does international employee really lower the salary? I do not think so. But why do some people have such a thought? From my own experience, I think the reason may be that they do not work hard enough. In my sections, most of the international students could achieve better scores than natives. Therefore, they have better chances to earn jobs with better payment, which may result in not-well-payed jobs to others. In the end, these people may say that because of international students, they lower the starting salary.\n\nIn my opinion, we should support this new rules. Because with more competitive international students joining the job market, those native who really want to earn a better job will work more harder to show their talents. If you are real genius in your field, no one including your international competitor can beat you. On the contrary, the competition will always bring harder working.\n\nFor those who said that university is enough to prepare your industry career in the field of science and technology, I really wonder whether you have STEM degree/experience or not. If this is true, this means that there is no difference between a engineer with five year experiences and a new graduate. However, why do all companies want people with experiences? How important Industry experience is is very obvious at this point.  \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael Zhen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17622", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the OPT program should be prolonged. \n1.

The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation.

If no students entering job market result from OPT STEM program, the US would be much less competitiveness in high-tech fields.\n2. Most of the projects in STEM fields are a long period of time due to the complexity and importance, so the duration of OPT less than 24 months would lead the project unmanaged. Most of the projects in software development companies are more than several years, if the OPT students have to leave US due to OPT duration, it would be a disaster for the company and make the companies lose lots of profits.\n3.  As an international student, the experience we gain in US company will help the company expand to the global much more easily. For instance, Facebook is now actively entering China's market. If no international employees from China due to OPT duration, this campaign would be much harder.\n4. The longer an international student stays in US, the more he/she would pay for living expense, which in return helps boost the US economy.

To be honest, I see a lot of benefit from this program and I have posted a comment for that.

That's abusing since the abusers are trying to make an illusion that all American people hate internationals. That's NOT TRUE.

It is a shame for our people to ask \"Why should we hire international students?\" If you have ever got some of higher education, you should be able to see the contribution of foreign labors during the past decades. They are one of the important foundations of our American dreams. It is not reasonable to require our legislators to expel internationals students because you can't land a job, or you are just laid off. Because you never ask how much profit they bring to this country. What you care, is all about your own money. Yes, the government will hear your voice, but they will not benefit you with a sacrifice of a huge income.\n\nAll in all, I just want the legislator to be aware, the majority of comments you see on this website may come from two extremities, thus very biased.

The foreign students are elligible for preferential hiring by American employers.  The foreign students are given \"Mentoring\" in work skills \"in order to begin careers in their fields of study.

Where are the programs subsidied by American Taxpayers to aid American students in getting on the job training in their chosen fields of study with American employers?  Where are the \"Mentoring\" programs aimed at American students enabling them to transition from the learning enviroment into the workforce?\n\nThe obvious answers to my questions are that the American Business Community, Chamber of Commerce, our Federal Government in the Homeland Security Department, and American higher education, have joined together to allow foreign students to usurp the rights of American students, and American workers.  At a time of unparalleled negative job growth in America, this is insanity!  We have scores, and scores of young people unemployed or underemployed, and these are American Citizens, not foreign students.  Why are we supporting foreign nationals with employment opportunities not offered to American Citizen Students?\n\nI urge the Department of Homeland Security not to enact this proposed rule extension because it strikes many a blow to the hearts of Americans in their struggles to attain higher education and their aims of acquiring a secure working income. American Citizens should come first in Federal Government priorities since the Constitution mandates \"protection\" of American Citizens first and foremost. \"Protection\" comes in many forms such as Military protection, and extends to protecting the rights of Citizens first in all areas of our government's responsibilities.

The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. \nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at XXX, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually.

What I am going to argue here is the tangible benefits of such an extension to the US economy and job market.\nWhen international students apply for master programs in the US, most of them, if they can handle maths, coding, would choose to study a stem major because of the attraction of relatively high quality US education and the STEM OPT policy enabling those who may find a related job after graduation. I do not have the total number here but from my conversation with Chinese students who study mathematical finance at Columbia University and Boston University, 80% of the students are Chinese out of a class size of 50. Each student would pay a $40,000 tuition per year excluding the living expenses that may range from $20,000 to sky limit. And, they do not have any scholarship. If you do a simple math and you would roughly have a number of  $60,000 per year per student, and for each program, the revenue is around $3 million. How many universities in the US do not have international programs targeting the STEM major?  Very few. If this STEM extension were cancelled, the jobs brought by these STEM would be cut off, universities would suffer revenue loss substantially because of the dramatic drop of STEM enrollment from international students. I believe US government agencies have already run the numbers and are fully aware of the impact of such a cancellation.\nSecond, for those internationals who are able to be enrolled in a STEM major, their educational background in their home countries are mostly decent. They have aced in the GRE or GMAT exams and they are well prepared to study for a vigorous STEM program that often times US students are not interested in. If you look at any of the stats about US job placement, you would see there is still an obvious shortage of STEM talents. These students have provided US companies a talent pool to meet the demand gap.\nThird, the job market is very competitive for international STEM students. For those who find a job, they spend all of their time studying when they are at school, and work on preparing for technical interviews. They aim at big companies, make the efforts and shine out of the job applicants and get a good offer. The journey of landing a job in the US is not an easy one. Only those who are good enough, tough enough may finally make this happen. And for those who say companies would pay less may have underestimate US companies' ability to make the best hiring decision from their perspective: they hire for the best, they hire for those who deliver, and they hire internationals only when they could not find domestic talent to fill the spot.\nIn conclusion, this extension will hugely benefit US higher education industry, real estate business, retail business, and small business owners as a result of the consumption contribution these STEM international students have brought. In addition to that, some of these students who successfully land jobs in US, fill those spots that US companies may not be able to fill with domestic talents in a timely manner. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Serena Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13862", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I TOTALLY SUPPORT this proposal.

Let me give a real world example. My husband has been working in a middle-sized company after graduating with a master degree of statistics. He first used OPT to work and later the company further supported his h1b visa. His company is in a great need of people with advanced statistics skills but has never been able to hire enough people with the required skills. Their team has both native Americans and internationals from Canada, Indian, China, etc. From the company's perspective, it is cheaper to hire native Americans because they don't have to pay the fees for lawyers and other applications to support internationals to work in the US. However, there are just not enough qualified candidates because the job requires a relatively advanced knowledge of statistics. The internationals they hired are all smart people that can fulfill the job requirements.\n\n I think this demonstrate that OPT and OPT extension helps high-tech company to hire qualified people to keep America a innovating country. For foreigners that can come to the US, complete school and manage to get a job offer from a high-tech company, they must be elites in their own country, too. Isn't it beneficial to US that they can have smart people from other country to come study and work in the US? Do you know how many nobel prize winners of US are not actually born in the US? About 30 percent! \n\nHaving students working on OPT and OPT extension doesn't necessarily mean making Americans losing jobs.

There are a few reasons that lead to my decision:    \n\n1. STEM students will have more opportunities to get H-1B visa in visa lottery to work in the US. Those students, who got high-level education from the US universities and training from the US companies, are very knowledgeable and skilled in STEM fields which are very important fields to US industry and economy. With new OPT extension rule, those students can contribute their skills and knowledge to the companies and therefore the US.     \n\n2. US companies will benefit from this new rule. Many US companies are growing and expanding their business, they are really short of hands (high-level skilled and experienced employees). The new rule will make it possible to hire eligible foreign students to work for companies for longer time. This also increases diversity of labors in the US.      \n\n3. US Universities will benefit from the new rule. The new rule will attract more foreign students to come to the US for study, because they have more possibility to stay and work in US after graduation. So this will create more job opportunities in education field and also in other related fields (Housing, Food and Restaurants, Car Buying, Insurance, etc.)       \n\n4. With the requirement that STEM OPT students should have commensurate wage with the US workers, the companies cannot consider paying less wage to OPT students than US workers so that both have equal opportunities to a job position. This will help to build a fairly good labor market in US which is beneficial to both OPT students and US workers.   \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Shishan Sun", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2410", "postedDate": "2015-10-26T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I would prefer to keep them here and take advantage of the education that they acquired here, \nthan to send them back to their home countries to compete with us in the world market.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mr-Mrs R Odom", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9483", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support 24 months opt to all F1 students current and future students ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sri Manikanta Reddy Vajrala, Sapphire Software Solutions", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0143", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I STRONGLY support this new OPT extension rule.\n\nI'm an international master student major in Computer Science. I am currently an intern at CodeBroker LLC as a Java Software Developer.\nThere are many countries I can choose to pursue my master degree other than US. The reason I choose US is the industry training opportunities after graduation, which is a great benefit for me. The training helps me to convert all the skills I learn from school into real productive experience.\nWithout this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. This is a huge loss to the US universities and schools because international students pay higher tuition fees which becomes a main income of many universities and schools.\n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my current work experience, it takes almost 6 month to get familiar with company development platform before the employee become productive and efficient. Also, many company projects usually takes up to 1 year to complete. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers would lose their VISA before completion of company projects. It cause a huge lose to the company.\n\nAs a Chinese STEM student, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China.

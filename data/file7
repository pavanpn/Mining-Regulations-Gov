Many of them are not planning to stay in the US, leaving an even smaller number of potential hires for research institutions and businesses. The STEM program was created in order for the US to maintain its global leadership of technical advances. In an extended period of time, the program allows us to utilize the high-skilled workers in whom we have invested much educational resources. At the end of the program, the workers will leave the country unless they successfully win the lottery to an H1B work visa.\n\nThe STEM extension program benefits the US economy in many ways. There is an extremely high demand for STEM workers right now in the US. Companies are finding it so difficult to recruit researchers and engineers that it does not make sense to cut them off of a chunk of their employees after 12 months. Hiring international students is not cost effective - the companies will still lose most of these people at some point due to visa issues. If they want to keep the workers by submitting an H1B work visa application, they will have to pay high fees and lawyers and still face a low success rate of less than 30 percent. Nonetheless, companies are still recruiting international students because they really need high-skilled STEM workers.\n\nStopping the STEM extension program hurts businesses, especially small businesses in fast-growing technical fields, such as medicine, engineering, and software development. First of all, it will cost a lot of time and money for small businesses to search for new workers to replace existing workers on OPT work permissions, especially if they have originally planned for their workers to apply for STEM extensions. It would be even harder than it is now for small companies to compete with large corporations to hire competent workers if the pool of potential hires shrinks, as more than 50,000 STEM students near the end of their OPT work permission leave the country. Without the program, many STEM students will choose to leave the country right after finishing their degree, just as most non-STEM students do. This will worsen the hiring situation for many small businesses.\n\nThe STEM extension program alleviates the shortage of STEM workers in the US without harming the chances of employment of US citizens and permanent residents. Please seriously keeping and improving the program for the many research institutions and businesses affected.

Open-source projects, which allows each brilliant person from anywhere involves in developing and improving, are getting more and more popular recently. And it has also proved itself a success. Google, Yahoo, IBM and so on are all one of world's largest open-source companies, whilst are bellwethers at respective fields. It will be sagacious to carry out this proposal, which resembles open-source project, to maintain American world's leading position in long term. \n\nIn short, I deem it is absolutely one 'Hitting multiple birds with one stone' proposal.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mingwei Hu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7413", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This will benefit both the US and high skilled international labors.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tuyen Vu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2634", "postedDate": "2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "With so many qualified Americans out of work, expanding this program in order to help big corporations hire cheap foreign labor is a slap in the face to U.S. citizens.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\nInternational students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. \n\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest.

The college tuition fee plus living cost for a foreign student can be as high as $70,000/year. This enormous amount of money will not go to China or Mexico, but flow into the US economy, and thus creating thousands of jobs in the US. \n\nThe average wage in the US hasn't been increased for years now, thus I do understand those claiming that the Obama government is trying to use foreign students to lower down the wage. However, I think the real reason is that the US has encountered the middle income trap, which means that given America's current resources and advantages, people's wages cannot go higher. The only way to drive all US workers' wages up is to have a productive and innovative economy. In the current globalized world, having only the local talents are not enough, we really need those top foreign students to bring energy and innovation to our society. Do you really think that you will have a better paying job if we chase all the foreign students out of the US?

As I am in the IT industry for a couple of years.  It is hard for me to believe that a company who is aiming to keep their competitiveness and excellence would want to hire employees only because they are \"cheaper\". As an employer, it is always the tech-related skills that should be concerned. As an insider, I can be responsible to say that a interviewer who made the final call when making hiring decisions wouldn't want to care your immigration background while testing your skills. Only those HR would collect those information, but it is not them to make the decision.\n\nSo the opposing opinions rely on a false presumption! They claim immigration policy should serve in the interests of American works and OPT is against them. But OPT is not an immigration policy nor being against them. They should be opposing H1B visa policy, or even green card policy, rather than focusing on OPT.\n\nAs I understand it, those opposing sound simply want to prevent their competitors to be hired in order to get higher chance of employment.

They just cannot admit that OPT only look unfriendly to those low-skilled American workers, and for those lower-skilled job-seeker, it wouldn't even make a change whether OPT exists of not.

Which is essential for the US corporations to stay competitive globally. \n\nAs a Finite Element Analyst in a S&P 500 company, I see the STEM international students make up 1/3 of all the core R&D specialists. Without the international students, the whole research capability of the department is believed to drop a lot. In that case, our company is not likely to be able to stay innovative in new products development. This kind of high end talents are rare in local American people, so our R&D department is highly depend on international students. \n\nBesides, our product development life cycle is quite long, usually last for many years. As a result, the extension for the OPT will greatly benefit our company, in saving quite a lot of the cost to recruit new Analysts and training them.\n\nIn conclusion, STEM international students on OPT are very crucial high end work force for  R&D, and the companies need them to stay long to promote the new technology.\n\n2. STEM work force belong to the high salary category. Their consumption contribute much more than the average population.\n\nDue the job natures, these international OPT students get much higher salary than average American people. According to what I know, their salary range from 60k to 150k per year, and even higher.

In STEM, people from China and India takes a large portion. Each year, China loses a huge amount of highly qualified manpower resources. The intellectual students in the top universities of China, who have passed countless horrifying peer competitions to succeed, are seeking to continue their study in those famous universities in the U.S., and many of them would like to find a job after graduation in the U.S. Sometimes, I really worry about the situation that China has exported too many excellent students and workers to the U.S., contributing to the development of your country, not mine. \n\nYes, I admit, if there are less people compete for a post, the wages could increase. But think for a while, what those international companies would do to cut the cost? I believe they would choose to move to a country with abundant and highly-qualified workers. You may recall how U.S. loses the manufacturing industry by the high cost. It could be anticipated that, in the near future, U.S. will become less and less attractive to the STEM workers. Maybe one day, companies like Apple and Microsoft would like to move most of their R&D centers to China or India. This is what I really hope to see, as a patriot from China.\n\nCancel the extension, please, if you would like to send back those qualified workers. You may even cancel OPT and CPT, if you are really willing to lose the leadership in STEM subjects.

I would disagree with the fact that OPT students are taking away jobs from the Americans.\n\nHowever, one important issue I want to point out. USCIS has to implement stricter rules on organizations that take advantage of the H1b program. To illustrate this, I will describe as good as possible. A lot of multinational consulting firms are hiring from overseas where the future employees have no formal US educational background. They would submit H1b petition for those people and bring them here. However, the salary paid to those foreign nationals are way lower than the market rate. These consulting firms are taking advantage of these employees since they want to come here to get green card and the waiting period is typically 5 years so the consulting firm could drain every single cent out of these people for a very long time. This hurts the US job market.\n\nTo emphasize my arguments here, I would like to invite any party to do a research on all the companies that hire students on OPT and submit proof that students on OPT are getting paid less.

Of course, I am inclined to support this proposal but I believe the following reasons shows that the benefit of this proposal is also for the States as a whole. \n\nFirst of all, the proposal provides a way for the States to retain talents educated by US institutions.The information industry is one of America's strongest industry and is projected to keep being the industry that will shape the world in the future. However, there are many challenges lying on the way such as understanding the intelligence, dealing with larger amount of data and security. None of them is trivial and can be solved without the talents from other parts of the world. If America doesn't retain the talents, the solutions those talents can come up with will be owned by companies in India, China, Europe and other places. If that happens,America will gradually lose it advantage in IT industry, resulting in profound impact to other industry such as venture capital, banking, transportation and even everyday customer-facing services that being transformed by IT technologies.I believe this is not what the US people want to see.\n\nMany who oppose this proposal are worried about the competition in job market intensified by international students. However, competitions can not be avoided. If US aids its native students by limiting international students, the international students will still work for non-US companies. Competition just shifts from US job markets to between US companies and foreign companies. The US students may seem to be able to find a job easier but overall US companies and  industries are less competitive. In the long term, there will be less jobs for US students and the job market will get intensified anyway. But it's worse that job market being intensive at the beginning because at least in the beginning the US companies owns the international talents as well but in the later case, they will end up owning only the US talents. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jingchen LI", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12582", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "without the optthe American economy will be hurted", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jie Xu, JAY", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0214", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Surely the intended purpose of Optional Practical Training is to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. Hopwever now it seems more often used by foreign students as a way to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. The DHS proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. The hidden rational appears to be that OPTs are significantly cheaper than US workers, 7.65 percent because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. Thus the result of the proposal ( whether intended or unintended) seems to be that American workers will be replaced by cheap imported labor.\n\nHere I agree with Senator Grassley of Iowa who said in his letter to the President: \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent\".\n\nIt is not as though there is a shortage of STEM graduates, there is only a shortage of CHEAP stem graduates.

The reason I will list as follows:\n\nFirst, Technicians make great contribution to US prosperity.  Turn back on  US history, tremendous graduates with high technical skills  who spreading all the industry, academy, and so on. They do not boost US economy,  but make the society stable. They are civil engineer who plan, design, and conduct highways, dams, buildings, making improvement of environment and managing natural environment. They are Chemical engineer who explores the process of materials or production and develop new materials. Here are countless examples to be listed all through US society. On the other hands, seldom see US citizen in this field, and I find most of them are in liberty arts and financial services. Also, as Albert Einstein, who is not citizen of US, but US government at that time approved his status to stay in US legally. Currently, some of graduate student do start up, which are not occupy any job position with citizen, but open more job to US job market and relief the burden of US unemployment.\n\nSecond, this proposal will attract more international students who have plan to study abroad in US. Because they can stay for long time to gain work experience  in US which make them more high competitive when go back to their country. The more they enroll in US university, the more contribution to US university, even US. Their life expense will stimulate consumption in US, including rent, travel, transportation etc. \n\nLast, the spiritual of US is creation, which make US standing lead in the world. We hope this spirit will last forever. That is US.   \n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Duplicate Comment Submitted by Selene Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18836", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The USA has gracefully granted school/work Visas to foreign/immigrant students for decades now but it is time to cut back & reduce our national debt & give our homegrown citizens better chances for employment /educational opportunities.

This short OPT can't get what it wants because longer duration is a must to complete some meaningful projects. For example, projects funded by NSF typically last up to three years. One-year OPT is not enough for meaningful training.\nAlso, international students contribute a lot to local economy.

This OPT extension is only applicable to a few, and students with STEM degrees are amongst them. I am currently studying here as a graduate student on Electrical and Computer Engineering, one of the STEM degrees, and I can see my fellow students come from literally every corner of the world. These students are competitive, hard working and creative, just like their predecessors, who came to America from other countries, worked in the most innovative and profiting companies and have been bringing great wealth and fame to America. It is how and why America stays the strongest in the world. STEM students are the ones who will definitely contribute to the society if they can legally work in America, not the ones who would steal job opportunities from Americans. Limiting their chance in working in America will do no good to America or Americans, as people with such talent and ability (either American or foreign) are deadly needed by many companies, driving foreigners away will just make many of these companies lacking for competitive employees and unable to survive, which in the end leads to depression on the whole society. Whats more, STEM students are well paid, according to http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/compensation/articles/pages/stem-wages.aspx.

For students study in U.S. alone, they are more independent to the local company here compared to citizens. I have been worked in KPMG for 2 years and audited lots and lots of company, and I witnessed all kinds of dark side relating to fraud, like scheme and collision. They are less likely to be conducted by people who are here alone and do not have access to someone they trust that might have the intention to conduct fraud. So combine STEM student with citizens in one company would largely reduce the risk of conducting fraud.\n\n2. Most of STEM students come from other countries and are been selected to U.S., and actually, they do not get education only in U.S., but also in their home country. Most of them come from countries with fierce competition not happened here, and they all get through it. So they are very capable of handling stress and large amount of workloads and it gives them a sense of accomplishment after completing the challenge. Also they are more respectful to their boss and company.\n\n3. Though extend the OPT STEM period will give more pressure to locals here in job pursuing process, but I want to say, I take pride in my work and I hope to work with people that are hardworking and be serious about their work. I know a lot of students who study here actually have very good family in their home country and are affordable for them to live here, but they choose to live on their own and start a new life. It reminds me of the reason why America is established. I do want to have more vivid and positive young people around me in my working environment.\n\nRight now I am a student in Fordham University in NY and will start working in PwC after graduation, but I have to wait and see the H1B result to be able to work here though I have put a lot of effort in networking and studying.

Also, one reason that successful companies in STEM fields stands at the top of the same industry is the contribution of talented international students. The more competitive these companies are, the more job opportunities they will provide. Of course, canceling OPT extension will temporarily remove some competitors for citizens, but that's short sighted. If these companies shrinked, it would be less opportunities for citizens of STEM field and those talented students will help the companies of other countries or even rivals of US which is definitely not a desired result. \n\nFrom the statistics of 2012 we can see that the unemployment rate of STEM is much lower than other fields. Also STEM industry grew much faster than other ones. The shortage of talented employees  in STEM is real, and the statistics speaks loud. The statistics can be found at US government official websites.\n\nAlso the argument that foreign students take the same job with lower salary is also not reflecting the truth.

I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.\n \nBest regards,\n \nSwapnil Chawande\nRochester Institute of Technology\nMasters in Telecommunication technology", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Swapnil Chawande", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19622", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this regulation.\n\nFirstly, the international students are not paid lower which leads to Americans can not find jobs.

And now, I am a citizen of this country. I fully understand what a great impact this could make to this nation. It all relates to what makes US the greatest nation I ever know. Let me ask a few questions, does any of you who left negative comments here remember how did we build this country? How many times did we see great immigrants, no matter it's scientists, economists or politicians, make decent contribution to our country? We made the best use of this great immigration resource, and we should surely keep this tradition.\n\nI saw some negative comments claiming that international students are taking jobs from natives, which makes non-sense. I don't know where those data comes from. Our economy is balancing back these years, job opportunities are increasing dramatically, which cannot fully filled up by US citizens, that's when international students should come in to help us out. And according to my personal experience, it's definitely not easy for international students to find a job here, companies still prefer natives than foreigners. There's not even any doubt about this. Why would they hire anyone who is at the risk of losing their legal status at any time? What's the benefit they can get out of this? You think companies are out of their mind? Especially under the circumstances that it's harder and harder to get H1B in recent years. I cannot even I imagine what a disaster this could be if OPT program is cancelled!! International students are making their contribution, let them stay!\n\nAnother benefit for US if we extend the OPT program. That is, more and more international students will come here, bring more energy to this land and more economic contribution. I did my graduate degree in Indiana and witnessed the whole process of changing. As the local universities taking more international students, the local economy was reborn. The small town I stayed became a mid city over the years. And you must admit that money are coming in when you embrace international students. Therefore, I think we should not only extend the OPT for STEM, but also for other majors, they should have the right to work here and gain experience. Otherwise, if you do not let them to work or just work for one year or so, that doesn't make any difference to their career at all. What do you think will happen? Internaitonal students would prefer not to come, because simply a degree? I can do it in UK, Australia, Germany, France or anywhere. Over the years, you have to admit that the OPT program are attracting more students to US, this is our advantage, which we cannot let go.\n\nIn summary, please support this plan, no matter if you're citizen here or international students!\n\nThanks,\nJake Stark", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jake Stark", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14541", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We need to stop this bill from allowing foreign workers to take the jobs away from the American people.

It's spelled, I-L-L-E-G-A-L and it's exactly what these people are, so quit sugar coating it calling them Undocumented Immigrants. They are illegal and have no rights, privileges or protections under the Constitution of the United States and are not legal citizens. Start enforcing the laws that already exist. Deport them and if they want to re-apply for legal citizenship, let them do it legally. If the laws that are currently on the books had been enforced we wouldnt be in the predicament we are currently in. We dont need 11 million illegal immigrants in this country when unemployment is remains so high. This is also going to add to the healthcare dilemma as well as Social Security, Medicare, etc.. Before any new immigration laws are passed that will create an influx of illiterate immigrants a law has to be passed making English the official language of the United States. All of our ancestors came here and kept their customs and identities but they all learned English. They knew that in order to get ahead and be able to communicate with each other this was a necessity. The illegals that have recently come to this country dont appear to be as willing and this has created a major problem with education. Public education is guaranteed but the cost of interpreters needed to translate English into the immigrants native language isnt cost effective and causes a tremendous and unfair burden on current legal citizens and taxpayers. This is wrong and totally unacceptable. You have to look at the big picture and see what other problems this is going to create before you pass a bill thats only going to make matters worse than they are and cost the American taxpayers more of their hard earned money. Go to another country and see how far you get if you don't learn their language. Like Earl Pitts says, \"Wake up America\" before it's to late.\n     Furthermore, how ironic and despicable it is that you want to give Illegal Citizens rights they haven't earned and don't deserve while at the same time you want to take legal US citizens 2nd Amendment rights away. This also is not fair to former immigrants who came here and went through the legal process to become legal citizens. That is a big slap in the face and very unfair to them. Wake up, smell the roses and get your priorities straight.\n     First of all,greedy legal American citizens and corporations need to stop luring and exploiting illegal immigration by creating jobs, hiring and providing shelter and food. We also need an e-verify system to enforce this.    \n     Make it a Class A felony with mandatory minimum 10 years imprisonment to hire, rent, feed or offer shelter to illegal aliens that would rapidly help resolve the problem. This would also stop the exploitation of illegals by US citizens and remove the temptation for illegals to come here in the first place.\n\n          ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bob Prosser", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3751", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Do NOT expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees & CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students!\n\nTrain USA born citizens instead!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Debra Pope", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9595", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This program is obsoletely helpful.

Availability of such a robust program will encourage students who are currently employed in their OPT period and new graduate students to gain hands on training in a field that is related to what they learnt at school.\n\nIt is imperative to know that many STEM graduates are part of very important projects in their organizations and are very valuable assets. \n \nEnhancing opportunities during the OPT period invites room for more innovation and fresh minds at work. Employing STEM graduate students from US universities helps employers establish university contact for further recruitment. The income that US Universities generate from International students is almost twice of what they would generate from US citizens/ in state students. Curbing the STEM program will not only prove to be a loss to US universities, but to the students who aspire to study in this country and extend their career here.\n \nIn order to have a holistic experience, it would be ideal for the STEM OPT period to be expanded to 24 months as opposed to 17months. This is a good time period for students who are already employed, to achieve their goals and gain meaningful hands on learning experience & for students who are about to start their careers, to plan and execute their goals. It is no doubt that STEM graduates are highly specialized and have immense technical expertise.

For instance, a commenter stated that demand for technical workers was very weak in engineering occupations and growing modestly in computing and mathematics occupations. The same commenter stated that, especially when combined with H-1B, L-1, and other skilled workers, the number of students taking advantage of the STEM OPT extension would distort the domestic labor market. Some commenters specifically stated that employers would prefer to hire F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions because these students would work for lower wages. Some commenters noted that some U.S. firms had previously advertised STEM positions as being available only to OPT students. Commenters requested that DHS consider written reports, testimony, and other sources describing the state of the U.S. STEM workforce. Commenters also questioned the veracity of studies and reports cited in the preamble to the 2008 IFR, and some questioned whether DHS had interpreted that information correctly in assessing the then-prevailing STEM labor market. Some commenters stated that the STEM OPT extension was contrary to the academic purpose of the F-1 statute. In general, commenters who made these and similar points requested that DHS eliminate the STEM OPT extension and the Cap Gap provision in their entirety.\n\nDHS considered many factors in determining the proposed length for an improved STEM OPT extension period. An important consideration was the general duration of projects to be pursued by students on STEM OPT extensions. DHS believes that students participating in practical training in STEM fields should be encouraged to pursue meaningful projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of their field of study and help develop the practical skills necessary to advance their careers. This type of significant projectoften involving a grant or fellowship application, management of grant money, focused research, and publication of a reporttypically requires several years to complete. Stakeholders have indicated, moreover, that this process often takes longer in the STEM community than in other academic or business areas. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) typically funds projects through grants that last for up to three years. [46] And in many fields such as mathematics, computer science, and the social sciences, NSF is the major source of federal funding.\n\nSo Please consider that make the OPT EXTENSION TO 24 MONTHS!

OPT, although it is part of the US regulations, should be considered an integrated piece of the US higher education. It enables F-1 students to practice their skills in a practical scope, which may otherwise not be possible in schools. No matter how prestige a US college or university is, it cannot cultivate its students with pure theories. A best way is to encourage its students to hone their skills at US companies, while contributing to the growth of those companies in the meantime. Therefore a better chance for F-1 students learning from practice in US companies means a higher quality of the US higher education.\n\nDespite all the above, a great country is not afraid of competitions, nor is her citizens.

Most of Americans believe foreigners have privilege in finding a job in US. That's definitely not true. It is much much harder for a foreigner to find a job in US than a local. And it subjects to a lot of constraints like H1B quota. Every year there is only 85,000 quotas for foreign students and the number of people applied for it is much higher. In 2015, there were 233,000 applicants, which means only 36.6% of them are lucky enough to stay. Those unselected need to leave the country if their OPT run out of time. After spending so much effort to find a job, those foreign students are pending on a lottery to secure their jobs. If you assume the companies are willing to take the risk of lossing an employee and restart the recruitment process after a few months just to save this 7% in salary, then I would say this is ridiculous. Why not just hire an intern? The companies hire a foreigner because they are better than the local people for the same position. I agree that for a foreigner, he or she has less bargain power than a local, especially true for a fresh graduate. But it is never wrong for a company to save as much as possible money in order to invest, to grow, to expand the business. Otherwise it will die, period. A company is never for public interests. If you want to get a good job, be competitive. It causes companies so many troubles to hire a foreigner than a local; as long as a local is equally good as a foreigner, or even a little bit worse, I'm 100% sure the company will choose a local guy.

If implemented, this rule will allow the  international students enough time to bring new innovative ideas on the table and evaluate them, greatly enriching the science and technology sector in USA.\n\n2.  The proposed rule ensures that American citizen STEM workers will not get affected by the employments of non immigrant students in STEM areas. Proposed rule adequately takes measures to prevent any discrimination against American citizen workforce in terms of job opportunities or wage scale. \n\n3. The USA economy will be greatly benefited by this rule. During this training program the science and technology industry of USA will be greatly benefited by the skills, knowledge and training obtained by the F1 students in American universities.  \nAccording to NAFSA, \"The 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year\" [reference - NAFSA, http://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/]  \n\n4.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. I am currently in 17 months OPT-extension and without the availability of a STEM extension, I will need to leave the United States which wont be in favor of US economy because of the kind of projects and research I am currently doing. Currently, I am working on fabrication of Antireflecting Random Structure (ARSS) on different substrates such as Fused Silica, Silicon to reduce the Fresnel reflection. The current technology in the market which is based on multi-layer thin-film coatings technology for antireflection has many drawbacks such as limited bandwidths, narrow acceptance angles, polarization effects, high costs, and short lifetimes in harsh environments. Therefore thin-film coating technology could not address many requirements that aerospace and military applications require: for example high optical transmission, durability, survivability, and radiation resistance.  Thus, ARSS could be an effective alternative to thin-film AR coatings in many infrared and visible-band applications. Such projects in technology allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience for the STEM graduates like me and gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. OPT time provides me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network.\n The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers. \nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\nSincerely,\nGopal Sapkota, PhD\n \n \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gopal Sapkota", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11383", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I do think it's necessary to have the OPT extension for F-1 students in STEM degrees.

Taking it away suddenly will not only making technology companies suffer from unexpected employee loss, but also dampen the willingness of all International students to study in the states.\n\n1. By offering the 24 months OPT extension opportunity to qualified STEM students, US companies have the chance of hiring the best students in the world, instead of suffering from high tech labor shortage, resorting to foreign CROs or even moving the company to other countries. Apparently, without the contribution of international students, the staff needs won't be fulfilled, given that who bother to hire foreign students who will require H1 sponsorship if there are enough good quality Americans available. Taking the OPT extension opportunity away will make US technology companies suffer, together with US economy!\n\n2. OPT extension is also a way to attract talented students from all around the world to study in the States, with a hope that after sufficient OPT training, they could become more competitive. Although United States has high quality of higher education, STEM students still have other options if other developed countries have better policies, or don't spend the money to come over at all. This will lead to big losses in high technology talents and education revenue in the US, again lead to US technology and economic loss.\n\n3. Furthermore, this policy will NOT jeopardize the American citizen's job security. The requirements of maintaining working status and non working days are very strict for F1 OPT students, only the very best/capable students get selected by this system.

Still, many students choose to leave without using/or using up their OPT, America is not somewhere every international students want to stay forever.\n\n4.

Because I chose to go public and got in the news; ABC w/Peter Jennings, CNN/Lou Dobbs, WKMG CBS Orlando, CIO Magazine, etc people were contacting me stating they were doing the same; training their foreign replacements so they could be laid off.\n\nHere is a small list of companies where people contacted me in 2003.\nhttp://commdocs.house.gov/committees/intlrel/hfa91679.000/hfa91679_0.HTM#104\n\nSiemens ICN, Lake Mary, FL\nJP Morgan Tampa, FL\nNCR, Dayton, OH\nAT&T Wireless, Bothell WA\nSiemens Energy & Automotive Atlanta, GA\nVerizon, Temple Terrance, FL\nFirst Data Corp, Coral Springs, FL\nBank of America, Concord, CA\nAIG Insurance, Conn\nCigna Insurance, Hartford, Conn\nCiena Corp, North Carolina\nUSAA Insurance, San Antonio, TX\nEaton Corp, Cleveland, OH\nCutler-Hammer, Pittsburgh, PA\nAT&T Orlando, FL\nTarget, Minnesota\nBest Buy, Minnesota\nCoca-Cola, Atlanta, GA\nHarris Corp, Melbourne, FL\nPeoplesoft, Pleasanton, CA\nChevron-Texaco, CA\nLockheed-Martin, Colorado Springs\nIntel, CA \nHewlett-Packard\nAmerican Express\n\nThings have gotten much worse since 2002-2003.

They are also great and respectable. Why is US different? It's the leading position of science and technology makes US stand out of other countries, and be able to protect the constitution and core value of itself and its allies in the quickly changing world. After many millennia, liberty rose and declined in Athens, Rome, in Europe and other regions in the world, always being volatile until the science and technology developed to the level that human's reason can finally defeat their cruelty encoded in genes. \n\nIn today's world, kind people can never sleep without anxiety. Terrorism is still raging here and there and economic system occasionally collapses without any signs. Our major energy resource, oil, may deplete in near future but controlled fusion and other techniques are still under development, with no promise of a certain fate.\n\nIn the history, empires rose and fell; economy boomed and then collapsed. The Karma of civilizations persisted until science and technology have stabilized our national and international society. In the modern age, without any doubt, the country owning leading position of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), will \"seize fate by the throat\" and be the real leader of the free world.\n\nSo far, this country is United States. This is assured by its great educational system. In the world-class universities, US professors of different races and origins, convey cut-edge knowledge to students from all around the world. In many departments, international students are even more than natives, and they are trained to excellent scientists, engineers and other professionals with high-level technologies. They are equipped with American value and pleased to communicate with peers of the whole world. They have helped US becoming one of the most developed nations and the leader of the world. They have been involved in the revolution of computational science, internet and will contribute to the revolutions of future. This is the difference between US and all other countries, whose domestic students are absolute majority.\n\nNow, to maintain the leading position of US in the world, it's critical to maintain its attraction in higher educational systems. US universities have been well-known for its openness and all-embracing culture. Students can get more opportunities of practicing and keeping close to the realistic industry, than in other top universities, like in Europe and Japan. This is why millions of international students are attracted to US every year. Optional Practice training (OPT) has been one of the critical part of this valuable educational system. With the proposed extension of OPT, it can help international students to gain handful skills, complementing their classroom studying with first-hand experience. \n\nIn summary, approval of the extension of OPT is crucial for maintaining leading position of US in educations.

They will remember this shame, join a local company, and contribute to their own country afterwards. Currently, most top technology companies (e.g. Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple) are located in United States; however, ten years later, these top companies would either move their major departments outside America or would be replace by companies from other countries. At that time, even if US government wants to reactivate OPT Extension policy, nobody would stay. Many people would think my prediction is malicious and irrational, but Detroits current status adumbrates the further of Silicon Valley and Wall St. The only solution is to extend the OPT.\n      As a patriotic foreigner in US, I personally hope the OPT Extension could be cancelled for the goodness of my home country. I wouldnt use OPT Extension even if its not cancelled, and I will leave America after getting my degree.

Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. . --\n\nI think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at XXX, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the project's completion.-As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US University to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.point3acres.com for more.\n\nHope more people support this good rule!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Peter Tao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19329", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is great.

To support my opinion, I will provide three reasons:\nFirstly, United States is in its nature an immigrant country. In its 300 years of history, United States has embraced thousands of millions of immigrants coming to its shores from all over the world. Diligent and highly-skilled immigrants settle their homes here, establish their new social relations, open up business and start-ups, hire local American people to join their companies, all of which facilitate United States to become the world's first power after World War II. Immigrants have significant impact on the nation's business, politics, education, science and technology. For example, many successful scientists and researchers are foreign-born, in the year of 2013, 4 U.S immigrants won the Nobel Prize:  Martin Karplus, performs his research at the University of Strasbourg and Harvard University, he was born in Austria. Michael Levitt works out of the Stanford University School of Medicine, and was born in the United Kingdom. And Arieh Warshel, is a professor at the University of Southern California and was born in Israel. It's obvious that outstanding immigrants help U.S. to become the world's leader in the science and business realm. \nSecondly, allowing foreign students to stay in U.S don't reduce American's working opportunity, but create more available jobs in the long term. Many entrepreneurial students may open up their own companies here, hiring more local people. Their startups can also increase the government tax income as well. Some successful examples include Tesla, which was founded by Elon Musk, a South African-born Canadian-American business magnate. Clearly, the companies he founded(Tesla, SpaceX, PayPal) is shaping the world in many aspects. I firmly believe that in the near future, there will be more 'Elon Musk', because many foreign students I know in STEM major are very smart, diligent and visionary. I think more miracles can be fulfilled only if United States continue to support those capable foreign students.\nLastly, if the OPT extension act is not fulfilled, thousands of hi-tech employees will lose their jobs and forced to leave. In the IT industry, once such a situation occurs, many large companies cannot hire enough highly-skilled people. This will impair the information industry greatly and may pose U.S. in a dangerous position in global competition. Meanwhile, if foreign students are not allowed work here, less and less foreign smart students may want to pursue their higher degree in U.S. universities. This will lead to a great loss of top students and potential leading researchers, which is definitely not desirable for university professors.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alex Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17382", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposed rule.

The only reason for them to hire foreigner is due to the difficult to find qualified US citizen. \n\nSince the number of approved H1-B petition is so limited, it is very difficult for any company to retain a foreigner fresh graduate without using OPT extension after this young man/woman join the company. If there is no OPT extension, the company will face a dilemma. You either keep wait for another qualified US citizen/green card holder or take a risk to hire a fresh foreigner graduate without working visa. If the former option ever works, most company will take this option. The reality is that there is no way you can build a competitive technical team solely consisted of American because of the size of talent pool. If the company takes the risk to hire the fresh foreigner graduate, they have to deal with the possibility of losing him/her. Some company may be able to relocate this employee back to their home country for one year and find other way to bring him/her back. But this is awkward. How can you train a new employee by keep relocating him/her? The reauthorization of OPT-extension provides a temporary solution to this dilemma.\n\nSomeone may criticize that the company taking the advantage of OPT by hiring foreigner at a lower final cost. I'm not quite sure about that. It may be true in some cases. But for most technical job, this doesn't make any sense. For example, it costs a company at San Franciso bay area at least 150K/yr to hire a good software engineer. This number is way larger than the tax money a company can save. Furthermore, it is usual for a company to join some kind of bidding war in order to secure a good candidate. The extra money they have to spend outnumbers the potential saving by hiring this foreigner student. I can hardly imagine how the most successful private section in US economy would consider hire a fresh foreigner graduate as a best practice of saving cost......\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Keyuan Huang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17875", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I totally SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:\nFirst, America was borne to be a great country that shoulder the responsibility to make achievements for human society.

Jyothi\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nRe: Comments on Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students\n\n80 Fed. Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I was glad to see the proposed rule for re instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to re institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\nEstablishing goals and a professional road map at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\njyothi", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by jyothi naga", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19631", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Strongly support the proposed policy!

This proposal is based on a false perception that there is\na shortage of workers educated or trained science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. I am a Graduate \nstudent in IT. In my experience in school and in the workplace, I have learned first-hand that there is no shortage, of Americans \ninterested in these fields of study and pursuing them. I have met many who dream of the opportunity to pursue a career in these \nfields of study but often find themselves financially limited in doing so. The students that I call my colleagues that do pursue \nthese careers find themselves struggling financially through school to graduate to a rough job market swamped with foreign\nworkers. I often run into that same issue. Have you considered the disadvantages you are placing against American students like \nmyself and many others still in school about to graduate to an already rough job market or are you simply providing more rules \nand regulations and bureaucracy for you to regulate and review as a form of job security at the expense of American students?\nPlease answer this question and cite and explain properly sampled surveys and research papers prepared on this. Please \nprovide the Administration's official comments and any opposing comments by Congressional representatives.

This is\nbecause the OPT worker would be cheaper to companies due to not having to pay SS and medicare tax to the OPT worker \nas they would for citizen workers. How is this fair? Why should they not have to pay the same taxes for OPT workers as \nUS Citizen workers. This regulation is meant to further the insourcing agenda of bringing foreign workers here for less money\nto the employer and leaving Citizen workers out in the street. Please cite the constitutional basis and pertinent case law \nthat states that non citizen workers are or should be exempt to the same taxes as citizen workers. To this I would cite \nAmendment 14 Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution which states \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and \nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make \nor enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive \nany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.\" This shows the constitutional intent was for all U.S. Citizens to be given equal protection of the law.\nHow is it Equal Protection of the law for the law to allow foreign non citizen workers to be more attractive to employers tax wise\nthan citizen workers. I would like to know how this piece of regulation gives me a citizen worker equal protection under the law?\nPlease answer this specific question with specific constitutional cites as well as cites to pertinent case law.

For people who deny this, I have to say there is no base or evidence that international students don't pay their taxes. \n\n- They are NOT relying on social benefits. They are not claiming benefit checks from the government month to month. In addition, they are mostly young professionals who are in their prime and less of a burden to the medicaid system.\n\n- They are CONSUMERS. They buy goods and services from many small US businesses - land lords, shops, malls, restaurants, etc. which are critical to local businesses.\n\n- They do NOT cause domestic unemployment. When Cuban refugees rushed to the city of Miami in 1959, there was no evidence to support the claim that refugees would bring down wages of US workers. In fact, a vibrant community grew and prospered. Same conclusion is supported by many studies and social experiments again and again. STEM majors are in high demands - a constant shortage of skilled workers. International students don't take those jobs from US workers, if the demands can't be sufficiently met. The US government should not create artificial monopoly. It's against the essence of free market and capitalism.\n\n- They are KEY for US's technological advances. Skills in STEM are very important for America to keep its edge in today's competitive world. We don't want to train them in our universities and push these talented and motivated individuals to Russia, China, India, etc. It's not the best interest for America, and it doesn't make any sense to do so.\n\nFor all the reasons above, I support the proposal by the DHS on OPT extension.

I have five reasons.\n\n1. There are not enough well educated national students in the States. Nowadays, the competition between nations are the competition of knowledgeable persons. Knowledgeable persons need higher educations. But you could find very few national students in the graduate school of every university or institute. Most of the STEM major graduate students are from Asian countries or Mideast countries. Therefore, we need to keep more foreign knowledgeable people in the States.\n2. Foreign students need more time to figure out their position in a organization and to proof their value to the States. With the current one year OPT period, talented students may not get a chance to proof their value to the States. Most cases, they will go back to their mother countries and serve there. A lot of people will transfer what they have learned in the States to their mother countries. A lot of our advanced technologies were leaked to other countries in this way!\n3. It is a waste tax payers' money to train people of other countries. Most part of the STEM students (PhD students) are fully funded by university stipends. USA pay their tuition and living expenses for several years and educate them with the most advanced knowledge and technologies and finally push them out to serve other countries. I do not see any point to do it like this.\n4. Extension of OPT, of course, will take some of the job opportunities from national graduates. That is the nature of competition. I believe, if national graduates are good enough, their job could never be taken by international graduates. What USA needs to make it grow is talented people that adequate for a job but not an inadequate national graduate. Without competition any country could not get better. OPT extension could make sure this competition is fair for every graduate and bring the most suitable person to an job opportunity.\n5. OPT extension is good for the diversity of every organization. Different culture could make new ideas. USA need to absorb more diverse cultures to enrich our communities and to broaden our vision. Foreign STEM graduate could make wherever they are at a diverse environment, that everyone will get benefit. As well, as a country, the State will grow faster and healthier.\n\nIn summary, the extension of OPT, in my opinion, will not take the job opportunities away from equivalent national graduate. It will make the State more competitive and more diverse.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mark Ye", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17931", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is important to keep OPT 24 months extension for STEM students, because it will help the U.S. market to keep international students workforce.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Cynthia Tse", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20414", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This is a positive step towards economic growth as this keeps the talented and skilled STEM graduates in the country who contribute towards nations economy heavily.

I would definitely like to explain why that is the case. \n\nOne cannot overstate the economic benefits of the record-breaking international student enrollment in the United States. According to NAFSA, for the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs. Compared to the previous academic year, this is nearly a 12 percent increase in dollars contributed to the economy and an 8.5 percent increase in job support and creation.\n\nStudents coming to the U.S. are studying across the nation. California, New York, and Massachusetts saw the largest boost from international students and their families from spending on living expenses, tuition, and fees. It was also found that three U.S. jobs are created or supported for every seven international students enrolled. These jobs are in higher education, accommodation, dining, retail, transportation, telecommunications, and health insurance. In Ohio district alone, 1,528 international students contributed over $56 million to the local economy and supported 837 jobs. And in  state of Alabama, 7,451 international students contributed around $183 million to the economy and supported 2,064 jobs. Furthermore, international students are particularly important to the U.S. metropolitan areas in which they live and study. Many foreign students come from fast-growing cities in emerging markets and international students can serve as bridges between their home cities and the U.S. cities where they come to study.\n\nBut international students and international exchange contribute far more than monetary and job gains to the economy. We cannot underestimate their immeasurable academic and cultural contributions to America's colleges, universities and local communities. They also bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs, and support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework.\n\nInternational education and exchange also builds relationships among communities in the U.S. and abroad. It is through these relationships that together we can solve global challenges like climate change, the spread of pandemic disease, and combatting violent extremism. In addition to expanding access to international education for students from diverse backgrounds, only by engaging multiple perspectives within our societies can we all reap the numerous benefits of international educationincreased global competence, self-awareness and resiliency, and the ability to compete in the 21st century economy.\n\nData confirms that the United States, which hosts more of the world's 4.5 million globally mobile college and university students than any other country, remains a destination of choice for higher educationfor now. Due to increased competition from other countries, the U.S. lost nearly 10 percent of its market share of international students in 10 years, declining from 28 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2011. Without immigration reform to help remove barriers that prevent some students from studying in the U.S. or remaining here after they finish their degrees, the U.S. is missing out on enormous benefits. We must find a way to make the United States a more welcoming nation, a value upon which this country was founded. If foreign students are not provided amicable environment, the billions of dollars they contribute to this nation, along with the invaluable academic and cultural contributions they bring, will be at risk.\n\nregards, \nScott Peterson", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Scott Peterson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5235", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons:\n\n1.

As far as the depleting funds in the Social Security/Medicare are concerned, please remember that a foreign national pays tax at a rate of  30% (almost 40% in California). Not sure, but last I checked, such contributions did provide the US Govt. a lot of money. \nA lot of folks seem to be under the impression that the US Govt. is spending money to educate internationals, and that somehow we do not have student loans. Let me reassure you nothing could be farther from the truth. I myself went to an IVY league school and am still trying to repay student loans.Please also remember, a foreign national does not get to enjoy any of the benefits of Social Security / Medicare once they are on a H1 visa even though they pay the ~7% tax on their paycheck . \nHaving put these things in perspective I do believe that foreign nationals should be given the opportunity to at least be competitive in the job market.

The national average salary for a software engineer, for instance, is $90,000, according to employment site Glassdoor.\" I can vote for this statement, as being a STEM student myself I have a sense of the job market and I can speak for myself that my compensation is competitive or at times is more than what a US worker would get. \n\nIf this program were to be shut down this would see a drastic decrease in influx of foreign students coming to pursue higher STEM degrees from US universities.

The regulation will benefit not only the international students but also the economy and development of United States.\n\nFirst of all, the Expanded OPT can attract more talented international students to US universities, so that helps improve the diversity of the top universities. Besides, international students usually pay higher tuition which will increase the fund for the university. Also, more international students will foster the the economy in the city of the university by renting apartment and eating in the restaurants.Thus, more working opportunities can be provided.\n\nSecond, the Expanded OPT also helps the companies who hire the talented international student. A lot of the projects in the company took longer than 1-2 years. With this extended OPT, companies can find the right person to work on the project until it finishes. \n\nThird, some views against this regulation like \"some companies pay less for the international students so that natives have less opportunities\". I agree with this opinion. But what I don't agree is the way to solve this problem.  \"All men are created equal\" is the American spirit which attract talented people around the world to the US. Paying less to an international student is not only unfair for the natives but also unfair for the international students. We should work together to go against this unfair instead of sacrificing one party for the benefits of another party. Besides, as I know, those good companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon(I myself am working at Amazon.), they pay the employee depending on their capabilities not their nationalities. This new regulation includes a lot of restrictions for the company who wants to hire international students, which will prevent the company to take advantage of low pay international students. For example, company have to invest in formal mentorship which increase the cost to hire an international student.\n\nFurthermore, for what Iunderstand, OPT is for a student to do internship. It is understandable that the pay is a little bit lower than formal employee. And for a company to transfer an international intern to a formal employee, the company have to pay high immigration and lawyer fee to help the intern get a work visa. This is also a big cost for a company. I know there are a lot of small companies they refuse to hire international student because of this. \n\nTo summarize it, giving longer OPT would benefit US education, economy a lot. Hiring a international student is not less expensive to a company if we consider the cost of Visa and the risk that a employee might leave because of not having a visa. Most of the good companies actually pay depending  on a candidate capability instead of nationality. Besides, in order to eliminate the unfairness, we should work together to improve the payment regulation of the companies who are trying to take advantage from the international students, instead of sacrificing them. \n\nI'm very glad DHS gave this proposal. Because I can see the American spirit which makes the US a such great country from the proposal. I believe everyone in the US would like to help cultivate the spirits and make the country even better.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xu Peng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18754", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Highly educated and skilled students who can help fill needed jobs should have the opportunity to continue residence in the United States", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Linda Jung", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8541", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this, since I have paid a lot of tuition and got a decent job here and I also invested a lot of money in stock market, which would be beneficial to the overall economy.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xiangjin Zou", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10036", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT is not for illegals!

I completely support this amendment!\n\nIt is common knowledge that companies in STEM fields perennially face shortage of highly skilled employees, and suffer as a result of this dearth, which in turn affects the economy. There are over 5 million jobs in STEM \n(http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2014/02/05/report-stem-job-market-much-larger-than-previously-reported) \nand a lot of those go unfilled every year because of lack of skilled employees; there are just not enough US citizens who are able and willing to fill these positions. Over 4 million STEM jobs go unfilled each year (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real). Over 500,000 skilled positions are unfilled \n(http://www.cbsnews.com/news/three-million-open-jobs-in-us-but-whos-qualified/)\nThus OPT (and H1B) is not just an opportunity for students on F1 visa, it is an economic requirement of this country. For e.g. more than half of silicon valley workers are OPT and H1B workers, and the economy there is highly dependent on OPT and H1B workers. The same is true of many other economic and tech hubs in this country. Unfilled positions means billions of dollars lost (http://www.businessinsider.com/industries-with-unfilled-jobs-2014-11).\n\nGiven that H1B visas are limited in number and each year the number of applicants are high, there is a 1 in 3 chance of getting an H1B visa during one fiscal year. As a result, without the OPT extension, 2 out of 3 STEM workers would have had to leave the country, and work in another country and compete against us. This 24-month STEM extension provides a much needed relief for such workers, and a chance to apply for H1B in next fiscal year. In addition, OPT will also drive wages up, as STEM workers on OPT have a much better flexibility of changing jobs, and a much better opportunity of wage increase. The sheer requirement of high-tech workers drives wages up (http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/05/10-h1b-visas-stem-rothwell-ruiz).\n\nThis amendment is an example of good and timely action taken by DHS to improve upon the court ruling, and if implemented, would be a great economic boost to this nation, as well provide much needed relief to thousands of students currently on OPT.

Too many visas, like the H-1B & the Unethical Optional Practical Training program have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need to require companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS and certainly not sent abroad. \n\nTrain Americans, Not Foreigners. Put Americans To Work. Practical Training Program(s) should have no options to hire anyone other than an American. Any Training paid for by Americans should be for Americans.\n\nBefore any new green cards are issued to foreign workers abroad, employers should be required to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed American workers.\n\nThe influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working class Americans - including immigrants themselves and their children - to earn a middle class wage. The unethical Optional Practical Training program will only worsen the amount of poverty in America.  Nearly half of all immigrants and their US-born children currently live in or near poverty, including more than 60 percent of Hispanic immigrants. Every year, we voluntarily admit another 2 million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents, growing our existing all-time historic record population of 42 million immigrants. We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities' rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream.\n\nIncrease prevailing wage for H-1Bs & demand wages for any foreign workers. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program & the Unethical Optional Practical Training program will only worsen the number of unemployed, under-trained American workforce. Train & Hire Americans for these coveted entry-level jobs in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers who have been passed over in favor of foreigners. Hire AMERICANS First!\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation.

I am in Orlando and, while it pertains more to the H1-B program, I have heard of the shameful action by Disney to have some of their tech employees train their foreign replacements prior to their own termination. This abuse by Disney should exclude their eligibility from future H1-B participation and result in some sort of punitive action or fine. I feel that this is exactly the type of result that the OPT extension would foster in participating companies. We need to let US employers hire citizens first instead of a defacto \"hiring\" of foreign students. OPT was designed to help train foreign students and increase their chances of employment when they return home. Now they will be in more direct competition with US citizens. There are many here that are unemployed and should have priority for domestic jobs. Another aspect is the incentive to \"train\" these workers by eliminating billions in FICA and Medicare payments.

Secondly, the technology industry is still growing and many jobs are created every day. Those entry level openings need people to fill in. International students would not be a threat to the natives because the native applicants have way more advantages in the job market by all kinds of regulation. To reduce competition in such a brutal way is not healthy for the country. Moreover, since there are many caps preventing the international grads working longer, such as H1B cap and so on. We should not worry that those people will occupy the job market. Thirdly, stopping the extension will diminish the reputation of the states. US is always known as an embracing and open country.

The way this rule is published for comments and the comments that are now flooding this post shows that you want to publish this rule in a hurry without any citizen/US worker noticing it. This proposal has received minimum media coverage and most of the US citizens have no idea about what is OPT and what are its potential implications to American workers interests. This should ideally be published and made a law by a debate through US congress. Your last rule turned out to be a disaster for you and this extended rule covering the possible cap gap thing for foreign workers to stay here permanently and apply for green cards is nothing but a massive immigration scam. Any investigation about this  from justice department would lead to dire consequences to your office. That really shows your warped priorities to jump into the scene to protect the US multinational corporations that evade tax and employ cheap labor to mint more money. This rule requires more public attention and you should not allow foreign students or workers to comment on this post because they are the one directly benefiting from this rule.\n\nSo I hereby request you to publicize this rule to media/newpapers/TV channels/ US lawmakers in the congress. Ideally, they should have a debate on these issues on congress before this goes to a law.  The way you sneak this rule through backdoor to publish it without due public notice is very suspicious. Most of this rule is to make these students stay permanently in USA. We don't want these talent to survive as a country in among other nations in the world. We have enough talents and enough resources to make a big change in the world already. We don't need a intellectual import to save my country from lack of intelligent or creative brains/brain drain baloney you talk about.  Most of these comments are supportive in nature and are posted by Indian/Chinese/ Mexican students who are dying hard to stay in this country forever. You are allowing the system to be milked by fraudsters from India. Most of the consultancies have already done enough damage to the immigration system and job market by employing thousands of fake experienced candidates who can't even speak proper English to communicate with the co workers or mingle within the team. All these competencies have to be tested before you let a candidate to be labelled employable in this country after his masters degree. Current IELTS/TOEFL with GRE exams are not enough to test these competencies because most of these exams were cheated by students from India( students from  Indian State of Andhra pradesh are a great example for this). You should google up how these candidates fake exams in prometric test centers in India. As an American Citizen I am very much concerned and will even go to court against this law if you don't protect the interests of US workers. No student should be allowed to work more than a year. That's enough for their practical experience in this country and it's not mandatory to have practical experience in this nation as India as a nation has lot of technology jobs and lots of Indian companies employ these graduates once they return back. So you should not give away this OPT EXTENSION as a freebie to every student who come here to do masters degree. \n\nI strongly believe that  a thorough identity examination/background check and competency tests should be done before they even apply for a job. A database has to be maintained which has to be filled by these candidates before they even come to USA showing their experience and skills and this has to be maintained by USCIS to avoid possible fake resumes and fake profile issues done by consultancies employing these grads for money. Any employer who wants to employ a candidate has to do a thorough background check and has to get all the proofs of employment, copy of salary slips from the company they worked for. This rule has to be enforced to avoid any Indian companies to stop exploiting Indian Masters grad students to work as a experienced candidate in a US company. Many such candidates and consultancies have been caught. Law is not strict enough to stop their immigration proceedings and deport them for ever. The rule should be made such that any consultancy who gets caught faking resume or running fake pay roll will lose their ability to sponsor and all the candidate who has got green card through them will be revoked and candidates will be send back to their home country even if they get a green card. This rule has to be strictly enforced to prevent the immigration scams in future. \n\n\nHope you take a notice of my concerns and do the needful else this law will be thrown into trash by another judge in near future.  Please do not let foreign students to comment. Please take  a notice of real concerns of  US Citizens or US workers.\n\nThank you,\n\nEdward \"Eddy\" Sinclair", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Edward Sinclair", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7266", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this proposal.

The advantage of that is obvious even if it is a small part of US immigration laws and rules.\n\nFirst of all, international students are benefited for the important practical training after they graduate from college. This is one of the most important points which attract international students to pursue a US degree. Since many US companies in technical areas lead the world, practical experience in these companies becomes so valuable for new graduates and could make them competitive no matter they are going to stay in the US or go back to their home countries. I believe this is also a very important part for the US education system to make it competitive internationally. If the function is disabled, pursuing US education become much less appealing and less convincing, comparing to other education systems such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. Students will lose their confidence for US education.\n\nAlso, the demand of professional high-tech worker is increasing, which can be directly seen from the sharp increase of the H1B visa applications year by year. Companies are facing a situation that it is more and more difficult for them to hire enough technical workers. So it is hard to understand the request to stop and revoke the OPT extension rule. One of my friend was reached by more than 10 companies and national labs for opening even before his real graduation because they are lack of people with required technical knowledge and skills to work for them. This means the demand for professional high-tech workers and researchers is huge and urgent. If the work authorization can be extended and become more stable, employers can have more candidates to fill their positions and serve for them efficiently. This will definitely help the employers in the related technical industry to stay efficient and competitive in the globalized markets.\n\nThen for the cost issue, I do not think the STEM OPT rule is costly comparing to the potential benefit from it. As far as I know, many US companies especially in the IT industry are acquiring and hiring professional workers directly from the other countries due to lack of candidates in the US. Actually this is an expensive way with low efficiency. But I think the companies have no other choice because they cannot find enough candidates within the US graduates. The extension of STEM OPT may help them to attract more international students with the suitable skills to work for them. Furthermore, the OPT extension becomes very helpful as a buffer area for the H1B lottery competition to avoid potential interruption to the companies and their new internationally employees.\n\nIn general, I think to keep or to improve the STEM OPT extension rule is necessary and beneficial for not only the international students in the STEM area but also the US technical companies, US education system, and even the US economy. So I support to improve or to keep the STEM OPT extension rule. And I would like to seem its positive effect for keeping my company competitive.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bo Peng, IBM T.J.

Only profitable companies can hire more employees, only strong economy can insure everybody's paycheck. The only result of sending back the STEM students is that now the companies of their home countries can utilize their skill learnt from U.S. to compete with U.S. companies. Because of the much lower labor cost these foreign companies now can design and manufacture products with the same or even better quality, at a much lower price.

We have a big project here with other company, my OPT will be end at Dec.2016, so currently they do not assign long-term tasks on engineers like me in case we have to leave next year. \nExtra 7 month is always good for work experience and our projects.

Some company does not want to provide training for students with short OPT.\nAlso, it will be slightly better for us F-1 students to obtain H1B VISA since we could have 3 chances in H1B lottery. Many people from a country fill 5-10 H1B applications and get all H1Bs. Whereas good, hard working and creative students cannot get H1B and have to give up everything we build in the past few years.

Purpose of the Regulatory Action\n\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school.  The regulation seeks cheap labor, not bright students. The F1 non-immigrant classification is available to academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at any established school, even in an accredited language training program. This makes every school a qualifying school. So, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. This definition is so broad that anyone in the world would qualify.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months.  48 months is not temporary.  A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT. As stated in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code, this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B and therefore be eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. \n\nAs stated in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is an employment program only for foreign students.  U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.\n\nG. Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields.\n\nSafeguards of this proposal are deceptive, and in fact are not safeguards at all.  This proposal requires terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers.  At the same time, the regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S.workers. The Regulation does not restrict this to American workers or employers, but to other employers of the same {undefined} size anywhere in the world.  By definition, there are no similarly situated U.S. workers, so no one will meet this definition.  The employer can never be liable for replacing any U.S. Worker.\n\nIt is ridiculous to expect an employer to monitor and record his own actions by attestation.  The employer would be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.\n\nThis Regulation leaves the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers.  This would allow an employer to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign students.\n\nD. Mentoring and Training Plan\n\nThe Regulation has provisions to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign students. The Regulation leaves this to the employer.  DHS plans to have employers show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices.  This ambiguous language is intentional, and prevents the employer from being held liable for violations.\n\nThe Regulation fails to require the use of factual and actual documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers.  It does not require the use of payroll records.  What an employer is paying his current employees is direct evidence.  Instead, the Regulation allows the employer to use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys to report compensation for their U.S. workers. \n\nThe Regulations are contradictory, describing employers hiring highly skilled STEM OPT students.  This is directly contradictory to the stated need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced foreign student.\n\nThe Regulations do not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business.  It opens such definitions to the world by providing the use of  Department of Labor Office of Foreign Labor Certification.\n\nTo protect the U.S. worker, the employer should have to report the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. employee.\n\nThe regulation provides for on-site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should be required to conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet the educational requirements AND to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S.worker is in any way adversely impacted. Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both past and present for the past three years.\n\nThe Regulations fail to impose penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jack Harper", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3606", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The extension has been proven to be very valuable for the development of the United States, especially in the high-tech areas.

Here are the reasons:\nI'm an international PhD student in an ivy league university. My major is genomics, simply put, my research area is to find better way to diagnose and treat  human diseases. To help you better understand the importance of my research, I will give two examples here.  The first one is prenatal diagnosis. It is quite common for the doctors to perform chorionic villus sampling on the pregnant woman to find genetic disorders before birth, for example, Down syndrome. However, the procedures such as chorionic villus sampling either have relative low accuracy or have certain risk to the mother and the baby. I have worked out a method that can detect those diseases with high accuracy while having very low risk to the mother and baby. I have several publications for this method and a US patent based on my research. Another example is a project I have been working on is to diagnose the Crohn's disease. This is a very common disease in the US but the current diagnosis method is not quite accurate. I'm currently finding a way to diagnose the Crohn's disease with just fecal samples and this approach has very high accuracy. These are just two projects I involved with but you can have a taste that people like me can have great contribution to the country.  I currently have 14 publications and some are published in very high ranking journals. And as my research goes on, more papers will be published. My papers currently have 732 citations from other researchers, which shows that my research has been well recognized by other researchers. The number is still growing. Note that I'm currently a PhD student and have not graduated yet. I would consider myself as researcher with great potential. It is a pity and also a great loss for US if people like me can not stay here to contribute. Also, since people like me are extensively trained in many years and have highly specified knowledge and skills (I've already had a master degree and going to have a PhD degree), I don't think ordinary people in US can do our job.  Therefore, I think this OPT extension proposal is good way to keep those talented people in the US. This will definitely benefit a lot to this country.

This restrictive policy helped make the United States the worlds preeminent technological power.\n\nThe current policy has a very different purpose.  It is to open the doors to unlimited immigration of people the majority of whom have (for their job classifications) average or below average ability.  This will surely boost the profits of tech CEOs with business models based on large numbers of low-wage workers, but it will drive away the best minds.  Albert Einstein never expressed a desire to move to Bangladesh now did he?\n\nImmigration reform wont just drive away the best minds from other countries; it will do so at home as well.  As job prospects in science and engineering continue to stagnate and decline, more and more of the hardest-working and most talented Americans (including the descendents of recent immigrants) will gravitate to protected fields such as medicine.  There is nothing wrong with medicine attracting good people, but if only losers who cant get into medical school do science and engineering, well, how is that improving the quality of American science and engineering? \n\nImagine a big research university.  To improve it should both support current faculty and also work hard to recruit the best talent from outside.  Suppose that this University simply hired all external applicants without limit or discrimination, and divided up the existing funds for salaries and lab and office space.   Before too long the faculty would be crowded and poor, and anyone with any real talent would have left.  As with a University, so with a nation: it can happen here.\n\nOf course a University  or a corporation, or a nation  can grow, but always mindful of the available opportunities and resources.  Dumping an additional ten thousand engineers into a company that only has need for a thousand will NOT instantly cause this companys business income to grow enough to pay for them.  Thats ridiculous.  So is the notion that bringing in more average-level scientists and engineers, when we dont have enough jobs for the ones we have already, will magically improve our industries and create more than enough wealth to cover the living expenses for them and their extended families.  Not gonna happen.\n\nI strongly urge that we limit, instead of expand, the ability of foreign nationals to move here and take jobs from Americans, at all skill levels.  I propose that we go back to the traditional American policy of picking and choosing the BEST from around the world, instead of simply flooding the market with mediocrities so that the sociopathic CEO of Facebook can have armies of drones writing mindless web apps and paying them chump change.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Timothy Gawne", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3243", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new rule!

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. All the knowledge F-1 students learn is based on U.S education. Most of them are effect by U.S culture. After they graduate, they can contribute what they learn to companies. Some F-1 student even contribute their knowledge to U.S education. Some F-1 engineer help U.S company strong advanced technology. What I knew, my classmate and me studying manufacturing engineering. In the manufacturing engineering, we learn how to improve process with difference academic method.\n\n2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Without diversity, no body can make advanced. Diversity is key part of U.S which difference from other countries. Different culture make people think differently. If  it is homogeneous culture, people can not think outside of box. Without diversity, innovation is delay by decades. F-1 student can make U.S culture more diversity. For example, some Japanese students interested in how to make energy more efficiency.

I'm 30 years old and am a Korean-American woman. My family and I immigrated to the United States in 1991 when I was 6 years old. My dad wanted to go to grad school in the United States, and he wanted to share the experience with our whole family (my mom, my little brother, and me) so we all came together. After he finished his master's in environmental engineering at the University of Missouri, my parents were faced with the decision of staying in the US or going back to Korea. After weighing many factors, my parents decided to remain in the US and work towards getting permanent residency. This decision was made in 1997, and our family moved to Seattle, Washington. When I turned 21 years-old in 2006, I was no longer eligible to be a dependent of my parents' visa, so I had to apply for my own visa to stay in the country. The only visa I was eligible for was the F-1 visa. In December 2014, I graduated with my master of public administration from the University of Washington. I was able to find a job with a nonprofit that was willing to sponsor an H-1B visa for me. I started part-time as a case aide for the agency Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS) in Seattle and became a FTE as of February 2015. Sometime in June, I applied for a program manager position through the proper channels. I made it to the final round of interviews. My department director informed me that it was down to another external candidate and me. At my final interview, I had 7 supervisors from my department on the panel. The following week after my interview, the department director (Gary) called me to his office. Gary informed me that he had both good and bad news to share with me. Gary informed me that the panel of 7 supervisors (which included Gary) had unanimously picked me to be the program manager. However when he told the HR director at ACRS, the HR director claimed that there would be a lot of paperwork and potentially extra money involved because they would have to make changes to my H-1B visa application and told Gary to hire the runner-up candidate instead. They had already offered the job to the runner-up candidate (who happens to be a white male), and the runner-up candidate had already accepted the job offer when Gary shared all this with me. I was essentially told that I got the job but won't get the job because of extra paperwork that the HR director didn't want to do. When this happened, I consulted a friend of a friend who works at an immigration law office, and I was told that there wouldn't have been any issues with my H-1B visa application had they given me the program manager position. I also consulted with an employment attorney and learned that what the HR director did was highly illegal - he had practiced discrimination against me on the basis of my national origin. However, at this time, I was also under the impression that my H-1B visa would get approved, and I was not (and currently am not) in a place where I have the luxury of spending thousands of dollars to hire legal counsel in pursuit of a lawsuit. So back in July, when all this happened, I decided to absorb this unfortunate incident as a sunk cost and hope for the best once my H-1B visa was approved. On October 16, 2015, I called the attorney's office (the firm that's contracted with ACRS) to ask about my H-1B visa application because I was told that at the very latest, I would know about my H-1B visa by October. The attorney informed me that unfortunately, my H-1B visa was not approved and that USCIS reasoned that my master of public administration did not align with my role as a social worker (case manager). I consulted with a different immigration attorney regarding this issue, and she told me that had ACRS done the right thing in July and given me my rightfully earned program manager position, I wouldn't be facing this issue of my H-1B visa not getting approved.

Based on the proposal, employers need to provide formal mentoring and training plans for students and graduates on the program, also there is a new wage protections requirement for STEM students and employers. Since it takes time for employer to provide a complete training plan and also employers need to take responsibilities sponsorship after hiring an international student. In this way, employers will consider about potential employee's background and technical skills carefully to evaluate if the student matches company's requirements before employers decide to hire international students. In the meantime, STEM students need to improve their skills and be prepared for compete with not only american but also international students,if they want to get a job offer from tons of applicants. In my opinion, this proposal will provide more benefits to american employers and America. Because as an employer, he/she will has the suitable employee to work on with. Simultaneously, America can keep having high-level employees in this country and make profits to America.\n\n2.I think America will benefit from keeping international students here, educated in U.S. colleges and universities here while they receive additional training, rather than sending them out of the country. Because education is also one type of investment  and America invests millions for education. In this case, international students(especially STEM students) share same resources as American students, not only top-level technical training and top labs,etc. but also university facilities. If america forces STEM students to go back to their own countries after their graduation, it is more likely to refuse these professional people to help america to build a better country and it will decrease America's competitiveness on STEM. At the same time, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by U.S. educated-STEM students, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. \n\nBased on these reasons, I think new OPT extension will be a win-win situation if it can be approved.

The unemployment of some US workers cannot be blame to international students, just as I cannot blame it on my neighbor if I failed my exam. \n3.

Meanwhile, 12 month OPT is not sufficient for international students to gain enough experience themselves. Generally speaking, after 12 month training, most of fresh graduates are still an entry level employer. If they go back to their country at this point, this 12 month work experience in US is too short to be polish their resume, which makes US education itself less competitive to them.

As we all know that although all international students are offered the chance to receive training here, not all of them can find a job at the end. Those who actually utilize the OPT program have to be competitive enough to gain the job opportunity, which means that American companies have a better chance than companies in the other countries to select the best talent. Maintaining a top-tire workforce is such critical to the development of a country economy, which is not possible without the OPT program.

In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment.This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. [38] In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022.\nI believe Grand America don't want to lose these brilliant students, right?\n\n2.International students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.\n\nForeign students, for example, regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yule Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11156", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The United States can only be truly great when she opens the door for talented people all over the world.

Many of those students are funded through US government/industry grants. On an average $200,000 is spent on a PhD student towards his degree, and it makes no sense to train these highly qualified people and then letting them go without any contribution to our economy. \n\nInternational students add significant value to the U.S. economy after graduation as researchers and entrepreneurs. Measures that would make it easier for STEM graduate students to obtain visas to work in the U.S. after graduation - measures that many in higher education see as crucial to the U.S. maintaining its edge in attracting international graduate students -- are critical to sustained economic expansion.  \n\nOther countries are developing policies to promote the influx of foreign students to their shores, and there are also ways in which the current economy in the United States has reduced funding support for graduate students, which makes it more difficult to attract students to U.S. programs with attractive funding packages. It is the right time to ease visa/resident requirements to enable this considerable talent to remain and contribute to the future of our research and development activities or forfeit our lead to other nations.\n\nA report by the National Foundation for American Policy found that U.S. employers have spent some $3 billion in mandatory application fees since 2000 to bring over foreigners on H-1B employment visas, hardly a cheap expense, and foreign nationals are often paid much more in the United States than they would make in their home countries.\n\nThe argument that students on STEM OPT can replace US workers is very weak one. There is an annual cap (85,000) on the non-immigrant H1-B visas, which is a strong disincentive to hire foreign nationals. Implementing this rule is not going to change that H1-visa limit, but give enough time for students on OPT to have ample time to go through relevant experience and for the industry to get value in that time frame. A typical project in the industry/academia goes for 2-3 years (NSF grants etc.), so students with only 12 months OPT do not even qualify for those projects, in addition to the time spent in searching for an opportunity. Perhaps this program should be more flexible in regards to unemployment period and volunteer work. \n\nOne concern is regarding students currently on STEM OPT extension. The rule does not provide any guidelines on what will be the consequences faced by students with approved EADs through 17 months STEM extension program, in the event that the rule is not in place by 02/13/2016. \n\nNevertheless the upshot is that if we do not use this resource in the interests of our nation, someone else will. \n\nThanks. \n\nJohn Billingham ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by John Billingham", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0952", "postedDate": "2015-10-21T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "this is how brain dead obama and our politicians are.

There is also a huge national debt with a huge strain of all of our social programs mainly because we have too many illegal immigrants and too many new legal immigrants being allowed into the country while there are hurting legal American citizens who need more help but it's not available due to lack of funding of social programs simply because that extra money isn't there.

Below are 2 arguments from a local STEM worker and my comments:\n\n\"There are a lot of Indian outsourcing firms(far more than the number of large companies which are willing to give high salaries to foreign students) who preferentially recruit foreign students on OPT or import foreign workers on H1b to serve as consultants. These consultants do very basic and cheap contractor work for US IT companies.\"\n\n\n--- I admit this is a legal loophole in H1B visa. I guess DHS didn't realize these Indian firms will make every effort to push the consultant to abuse H1B, by filing many companies for one person. This loophole incurs the exponential growth of technical immigrants who do not have a degree in US, and many talented students not able to apply for H1B and GC to stay in US due to limited quota, and that's why DHS never erged to increase the quota.  But anyway, this has nothing to do with OPT, for OPT is only for US graduated foreign students.\n\n\nFor your second argument, if there were no market for contractors, these firms wouldn't survive. Almost all big and medium companies including FLAG are hiring contractors to save money and avoid legal risks. OPTs and H1s should find a position in any of the companies so that the firms can earn profits. Contractors are paid the same as employees and only lack benefits, and more importantly, hiring by contract does not distinguish working status since it's temporary. In fact, many STEM engineers who are US citizens are contractors. On the other hands, contractor work may not be basic. Again, why should an e-verified company (A promise for OPT extension) pay for a foreigner who has more status instability, higer legal risks, and less fluent English with high salary? Think about it.\n\n\n\"More importantly, US companies which do not find qualified US workers should invest more in training young US people instead of importing foreign labor\"\n\n\n---- Education is a complex and very long-term issue. As I see US government does spend much on education (at least comparing to China). Foreign students pay 3x higher tuitions than in-states in public school, and I believe the money mostly will be eventually used for education. The biggest beneficiaries are American students since they have overwhelmed advantage in population. And I do think American students do not perform good at mathematics, which is the foundamental skill for STEM positions. SAT and GMAT quantitative is just Chinese's secondary school level difficulty. I think that's a reason local stem workers are not so competitive.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joshua Tsui", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14769", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I firmly support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.\n\nFrom past decades of years, nonimmigrant students with STEM Degree have made amazing great contributions to United States of America, in Science, Engineering, High-Tech Industries, Bio Industries.

I am currently on the OPT STEM Extension which was vacated recently effective 02/12/2016. Our first attempt to obtain an H-1B visa in 2015 was unsuccessful due to the limited availability via lottery. Without the availability of a STEM extension, I will need to leave the United States immediately post 02/12/2016 and take my specialized knowledge to another country. \n \nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the following reasons.\n1.\tThe STEM extension period will provide me valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates can not only gain real-world knowledge in the chosen industry but will also be a great opportunity to practice the knowledge gained during the course of the Ph.D research funded by federal grants. \n2.\tThe additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network not just within the country but also internationally which will benefit the scientific output in the U.S. \n3.\tThese benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies and educational institutions to remain competitive globally.   \n4.\tIn the absence of such a program, STEM students with advanced degrees will be forced to leave the country if their H-1B visa application is not successful and will take their specialized knowledge to competing countries with more inviting immigration rules which will be a huge loss to the U.S. economy. \n5.     STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n6.\tExpanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in many industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for young children who are the future of the U.S. \n \nIn addition to supporting the other proposed changes, here are some suggestions for your perusal. \n1.\tThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months if not more \n A 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning to make it meaningful. Students with specialized knowledge like mine should be granted up to 36 months of practical training which will enable them to work on more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n \n2.\tOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension in case of a vacatur. The following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT\n(i)\tAny student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. \n(ii)\tAny application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. \n(iii)\tA student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the grace period.\n  \nConclusion\nThe STEM OPT Extension proposal has many advantages which will help fuel the U.S. economy and raise the bar for science & technology globally. The arguments that native-born workers are affected due to this program is untrue since workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs especially in specialized fields like mine. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and opportunities for native-born workers which will positively impact the economy. \n \nAdvanced degree graduates that are employed in the STEM fields contribute to the most dramatic gains. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months if not more, is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students through federal grants. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

This will stop most of the international students since the funding for international students is even tighter to get.\nSecondly, the knowledge that is learnt in universities is not very applicable if the students directly go back to their own countries. But if they have chances to get into the real industry in US, it will become a nice bridge between their local industry and the advanced knowledge from universities.\nFinally, in my current company, it is also very hard to find good candidates. We interviewed tens of people to fill one position because the position is so technical and it has very high requirements on knowledge that most candidates regardless of nationality don't have.

The proposal would surely help a lot of international students, Universities, Industry in many ways. I tried to give my 2 cents on the situation.\n\nI am not going to provide a generic view that international students contribute to the industry and economy, but explain my case, I am an international student working on OPT in one of the reputed company. I have been working for 7+ months now and my contributions to the company have been significant. We (team which involves other international grads and fellow Americans) were able to develop a novel solution to address one of the technological problems we were given as part of our task during practical training. The company now wants to patent the solution which is going to adds to its technical assets. It is obvious to see the significant impact that is created for the company which definitely are the roots for America's growth. It is not common for the team consisting mostly of new joiners to develop something that is significant in short period of time. I strongly feel that I am able to use the skills that I gained during my Masters here in USA to contribute towards its growth. I strongly believe that with my potential I would be able to contribute towards \nAmerica's growth and would want to contribute towards making it the world's best.\n\nIf the STEM extension is vacated, it might force me to leave the country which would be loss to my employer. The company I work for has invested so much in training me and only recently they started to get returns on their investment. It would be a loss to the company if I leave before the completing the assigned tasks. No company in future would be interested in hiring a international graduate in such scenario.\n\nConsequences of not having the STEM program.\n1)\tMany of the highly skilled students will be forced to leave this country and find other countries would definitely be interested in welcoming them as they are highly educated and trained in USA.\n2)\tAs many of the companies suddenly loses their work strength, they may incur heavy losses.\n3)\tMany of the prospective students would shift their interest from USA to other countries like Australia, UK and Germany. Who doesn't want highly capable and trained individuals.\n4)\tThe technological advancements this country was producing all these years would gradually decline and would have to depend on other counties.\n5)\tOperating costs for the companies would sky rocket and they may be forced to outsource their operations to a cheaper foreign locations.\n6)\tGradually the STEM grads in USA would decline.\n7)\tIt would be no wonder if USA falls back in competition for being number one.\n\n\nI therefore urge the DHS to implement this rule in timely manner and save America from heavy losses.

Why not give those students time and chances for them to work and pay back America for what America has already invested in them. They are young and driven.

Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card.

I spent a year in this company working as a process and development engineer. I helped the company with better understanding of the textile nonwoven processes. I worked together with our manufacturing team and significantly improve our product quality and optimized productivity. Thanks to my bilingual capability, I bridged much better and more effectively between our corporate in North Carolina, manufacturing in Mississippi and overseas plants in China and Europe.\nI am not stealing jobs from American Citizens.  I believe with my contribution, my company is in a better competitive situation, so the profit and the production get to be expanded. Therefore, many employment opportunities are created for local people.  Most of the students with STEM skills are popular in the job market. I don't believe there are many of them are underpaid. When I was about to graduate in July 2014, I had got three job offers. My salary was higher than the averaged Ph.D salary. I was offered full benefit package by the company, this is only because I can and will benefit my company. \nBesides, Mississippi is a less developed area comparing to the rest part of this country. Companies have so much trouble to find qualified employees, because capable people do not want to relocate to this area. Students like me do not really care too much about location for practicing their skills. I would say this is a win-win-win situation: I got benefited for job opportunity, my company hired me as a qualified engineer and Mississippi got financial benefit from me, as I am paying taxes, I have more money to spend, I pay my rent, I buy house... Even in diversifying local culture, diminishing discrimination, I would say that I am making contributions. \nI am paying full taxes, social security and Medicare. A lot of people misunderstand that we under F-1 visa don't pay any social security. We are truly supporting the whole country and the whole society. There is a single mom and her little son living downstairs of my apartment. The single mom never works, she gets all the social securities to raise her son; and I am proud that part of their live relies on my contribution.\nFinally, United States is seeking to revive manufacturing. The president Obama had mentioned many times in his speeches that he would be proud of \"Made in the USA\". To achieve this \"American Dream\", more STEM graduates are needed for this country.\nThis country should value the students with both international work experience and advanced educational experiences, particularly those students got advanced degrees in United State. We would transfer our international experience and also use our knowledge into our business; meanwhile, we fit into the American culture much easier.\nSalary is definitely a great measurement tool to judge the values and the performances of each student for their company and this country. Because companies will never pay a penny more than what the employees are really worth.\nTherefore, I support the new rule with 24month OPT TEM EXTENSION program to allow students who earned degrees in United States to connect their knowledge to practice, but more importantly to pay back this country for such a great educational system and platform provided to us. \n\nSincerely\nNing Sun\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ning Sun", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4811", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As an international student here in the States, it was a dream come true for me to move here and be able to study in an amazing environment.\nI feel the OPT extension for STEM fields is a goal that the US needs to have, because the fact is that we often come here through a lot of struggles to achieve the dream of a better life. It is this background that makes us entrepreneurial.\nThink of this extension as an investment in your own futures. Many of us create small businesses and thus create jobs for other Americans.

The list goes on. Yet the very best companies do still hire them. If we trust companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon to make hiring decisions in their own best interests, we have to believe that either STEM foreign students are a significant assets to those companies or there is significant shortage of local talents that all the additional costs to hire foreign students are well worth it. In either case, it seems to be in the best interests of US companies that the government to act to guarantee continued access to foreign talents to maintain their global competitiveness.\n\n2) OPT extension is critical to STEM education and financially beneficial to US universities\nComplementing theory with practice is a central piece of US STEM education. Expanding the practical training experience through OPT extension confers a superior advantage to US universities in attracting the very best foreign students. One would only have to survey international contests in STEM fields such as computer science to notice that foreign STEM students are a significant force to maintaining the global competitiveness of US universities. Moreover, private and public universities throughout the country are already enjoying enormous financial gains in recruiting foreign students to fill up their STEM classrooms. Annulling OPT extension would significantly weaken the appeal of a US STEM education, and would drive foreign talents and money away to competing countries such as Canada and UK.\n\n3) OPT extension is beneficial to US government\nOPT extension can help US companies to acquire and retain the best foreign STEM talents, and therefore boost the competitiveness of the US workforce as a whole. The huge influx of money due to foreign students flocking to US universities for a high-quality STEM education help US universities to flourish financially and even indirectly help subsidize non-STEM education for US students. There is undoubtedly resistance from a small group of US citizens who for one reason or another feel threatened. But that is the nature of policy-making: there are costs and benefits. In the case of OPT extension, I believe the benefits for the country outweigh the costs.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qiao Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5935", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program \namounts to corporate welfare.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\n- There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\n- OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n- \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\n- the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n- \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n- \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\n- \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\n- On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\n\n- Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\n- If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n    \n- If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n    \n- OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mike Lutman", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3336", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this proposed rule for STEM OPT extension.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\n2.\"\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\n3.\"\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\n4.\"\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ryan Vander Heide", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9492", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this and it is necessary to extend of OPT for F-1 students with STEM degree for the following reasons:\n\n1.

At that point, more Americans will be out of jobs. \nThe following are detailed explanations. \nFirst of all, without the OPT extension, I believe most well educated international students will choose to go back to build their own countries, and as a result, many industries in America, especially the IT industry, one of the most important industry that made America so innovative and powerful today, will be affected hugely. If that is the case, its foreseeable that America will lose to China and India in technology very quickly. By providing opportunities to and attracting the most talented people and scientists from all over the world to this country is what has made America so great for a long time. As a graduate student at one of USs prestigious school, University of Pennsylvania, Im starting to understand what international students are bringing to this country. Just 2 months ago, I attended one of the biggest hackathon in the states (a programming competition which requires students to form teams and build a software or product in only two days). At the product domo day, I saw a lot of awesome software that could be very useful in our life, and most of them werebuilt by international students, some of them even built a robot, just in two days. At that point, I started to realize that these people used to the best in their own countries, but now they are all here trying to build something in this country using their talented brains, that's what made America so energetic today. \nSecond, OPT extension or OPT itself is never the reason why some Americans can not get a job, a lot of my friends can not get a job right after graduation, but they just kept looking for jobs and try to find their own reasons. Actually, what international students have always been competing with are other international students, so in terms of getting jobs, they are never taking any of Americans' opportunities. Not even to mention the job opportunities helped created by these skilled international students who have helped building and improving Americas core industries. \nSeeing so many people posting negative comments even without basic logical thinking, Im so worried that the country is starting to lose it's spirit which has made the country so great and made the best people around the world interested in coming here and contribute with their hard work and brilliant ideas.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Scott Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17237", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the extension.  \nMy opinion is based on the following considerations: \n1.

Foreign students admitted to top schools in the States are talented, and hard working. American schools further advance their ability, and OPT gives them more time to repay to American society. \n3. OPT time is appreciated as part of US education package. Top foreign students came to the states as american schools not only provide excellent education, but also real-world practice opportunities.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I am pursuing a STEM degree and will graduate in 2015 with a master's of science degree in the field of Telecommunications. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nThe proposal to re institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. Currently, i am working as graduate research assistant in my university, this will be the starting point of my practical knowledge. I want to improve my knowledge further in this field. This will be possible by this experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule making. \nConclusion\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nNagaraju Pureti", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Nagaraju Pureti", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5340", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the proposal of 24 months OPT extension but have some suggestions regarding some points. I also have arguments why the rule is in the best interest of both the US workers and international students. My points are as follows:\n\n1) Several comments argued that the OPT extension increases competition for US workers. But anyone with an analytical mind will see that its actually the contrary. Research shows that every foreign-born graduate with an advanced STEM degree is associated with, on average, 2.6 jobs for American workers(link: https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/06/16/urgency-immigration-reform-attracting-world-s-best-and-brightest). A cultural trend in the country that I am coming from is that the top students in the class study in the STEM filed, and the best of them come to study abroad. Moreover, almost all the OPT students in my STEM field were valedictorians of their school in their home country. What I mean to say is that these STEM students are filtered after tremendous competition and therefore highly motivated, energetic and innovative. I have seen examples of several companies that were established based on an innovation by a STEM Ph.D. student that led to the employment of several natives.\n\n2) As a Ph.D. student in Circuit Design, I personally trained many undergraduate US students and guided them to accomplish their project. All of them have grown passion for the field and are hired by companies based on their circuit skills. A lot of my colleagues did the same to high school US students, some of whom later joined the STEM program. Therefore, the approach by DHS to educate international STEM students has both way benefits in complex ways that might not be immediately apparent.\n\n3) One might argue that OPT itself should be enough for all the benefits above, why do we need the extension? STEM fields are getting extremely complicated and even though the students have the capacity, its not possible to learn the practical aspects of the filed in school due to the lack of opportunities and time constraints. After hiring, generally it takes more than an year for the companies to train a student. So, if the OPT is not extended, then the student will have to leave the company as soon as he/she is ready to contribute. Therefore, I think that OPT extension is a smart approach by DHS to allow both parties enough time to benefit mutually from the relationship.  \n\n4) This point about the additional requirements in the extended rule. I think DHS aptly handled the issue of competition by demanding the commensurate status of the position. I also think that mentoring is necessary for OPT students to achieve their goal. But I think that the requirement of hard documentation for mentoring and training (paragraph no.: 80 FR 63387) should be relaxed. Please note that the training of STEM students is an automatic process guided by the success factor of both the company and the student. Most of the time, the training in industry occurs informally through discussions, design reviews and question answer sessions, which are hard to document. Since this is the first time most of the employers and also the DSO will encounter such review process, I suggest to allow back-and-forth communication between DSO and student/employer to determine whether the extension requirement is met. In other words, the the OPT extension request should not be rejected right away without allowing such negotiation about the training program.

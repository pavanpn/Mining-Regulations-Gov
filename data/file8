Because their dream which is just going to a party school and making money easily, would not come true. That is the reason why these people against this proposal. And I will list my opinions below to say why this proposal is absolutely right.\n\n1. The world is competitive. The US is No.1 in the world, and I think no body would say \"No\". But actually, there is a very important factor right behind the \"No.1\", that is \"diversity\". People who come form every corner of the world was and is coming to the US, they brings fresh blood to this country, contribute to and make the US better. \n\n2. The meaning of the blue in the US flag. If you search the meaning of the US flag, the blue means \"Justice\". And I don't think only Americans can be treated as \"Justice\". These international students, they pay 2 to 3 times the tuition fee than US students, and they study hard, but eventually they don't even have a chance to work and learn more in the real society for just 24 month more. They are not going to stay here for 10 years, it is just 24 month more, and this 24 month is important for these science major students to learn things. If they are forced to leave, where is the \"Justice\"?\n\n3. On the angle of US citizen who are against this proposal, I do understand the things that they are worrying about. They thought only if these international students left, and then they could find jobs. But do you know how many international students here in the US right now? During the 2013-2014 school years, there were 886,052 international students. This great number crates hundred thousand of job opportunities for US citizen. If these students were force to leave, how many US citizen will lose their job? You may say: \" we are welcoming them to study here, but we just don't want them to work here\". Dude, they are not fool. If they lost their working opportunities, they would not be coming here any more. The OPT extension is treated a part of the study.\n\nAs a conclusion, this proposal is right and it needs to be supported.

Thank you.\nSincerely,\n\nAn American Citizen who wants Americans to have a fair chance.\n\n\n\nBelow are several facts and elected official opinions that back my questions and statements above from the site NumbersUSA. Read them to learn more.\n\nNumbersUSA facts & government representatives statements.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\tOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n\tOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\tThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\t\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\tthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\t\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\t\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\tthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\t\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n\nEnd of letter.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mark Tario", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4712", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Great !\nThe prosperity of United States is, from a huge degree, due to the contribution made by international talents.

Specifically, she asked how he could suggest spending billions of dollars on such a project at a time when so many children were starving on Earth.\n\nStuhlinger soon sent the following letter of explanation to Sister Jucunda, along with a copy of \"Earthrise,\" the iconic photograph of Earth taken in 1968 by astronaut William Anders, from the Moon (also embedded in the transcript).

I have seen some native students who really enjoy math and science, but I have also seen those who are struggling with Calculus I and many of my American friends really don't enjoy math and science.  \n\nWe have to admit that there's not enough qualified Ameicans in the STEM related fields. We have to admit that unemployment is caused by many factors not just foreign students.

I support to extend stem-OPT period for the following reasons.\n\nFrom personal aspect, I am a new employee in CNH Industrial. I was shocked when I heard that the stem extension is denied a couple months ago. Since I am afraid to be one of the sacrifices of the rule cancellation. As we know, getting a H1b visa becomes more and more difficult these years, and there is no guarantee that an OPT student can get H1b in his first year of career. Therefore if I am not allow to extend my OPT, I will be likely to lose my job if I cannot get h1b visa next year. And this is just so risky I think\n\nFrom company aspect, they hire international students and in many cases these students are regarded as long-term employees. However, if they have to leave to country after one year's OPT, that will be a great lost for the company because these students have been trained for one year and they are already enrolled in their projects. \n\nThe negative thing will be that those high tech companies will be very hesitate to hire any international student even through the student is very competitive. Because no one wants to take the risk of losing employee if no OPT extension is allowed for stem student. I don't think this is fair, neither is good for the country. Potentially the rule of equality hiring is threatened, which may cause further social problems.\n\nAbove all, I highly encourage to extend the stem-OPT period. I would like to see those new international employees have the same right to stay in the company as other people. They work so hard, they should get bigger chance to continue their career. I believe the rule of 24 months stem-OPT extension will benefit the society and the county eventually.    \n\n    ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tan Cheng, CNH Industrial", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5764", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT Extension should be 36 months.

America is a country of immigrants and will continue to be so. It's a land of opportunity. If we are to protect our citizens by handing them jobs regardless how lazy and incompetent they are.

It's closely associated with the H1B work visa lottery. In the previous years, the chance of winning such a lottery has dropped tremendous due to the loop-hole of the regulations, taken advantage of by certain foreign companies (especially those indian consulting companies). To abandon STEM OPT will result in horrible consequences, as many truly talented foreigners will be forced to leave the country just because of failing to win the visa lottery. \n4. Once we stop the STEM OPT program, we are sending a message to the world that foreign STEM students are not as welcomed as  before.

The OPT STEM extension is a great way to attract the brightest minds from around the world to study at American universities. Very few students would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to come study at American universities if it didn't guarantee at least 2.5 years of practical training at the end. \n\n2. International students are not stealing American jobs. Most, if not all international US university STEM grads who work here end up being successful in their career. This, in turn, creates a lot more jobs for Americans and internationals alike. If I'm successful and bring a lot of value to my company, it will generate more revenue for the company, and they can use that to grow their organization. Therefore it is a win-win situation for everybody. So this is an important thing that one has to keep in mind as this was primary reason for court over-ruling the previous STEM extension. \n\n3. One of the things that DHS can restrict on is putting a cap on those non-immigrants on H1-Visa who pursue job in US without formal education in US. Thus having a formal US education in the form of Masters/PhD should be made mandatory for anyone who wants to work in US. This would also ensure that international students or any non-immigrants have the required qualification and quality. This would also prevent organizations such as Disney (which hired workers H-1 workers most of whom did not have education in US) from practicing these bad norms.\n\nSome of the consequences if the rule is not passed can be. \n1. Lack of diversity in America. Students spend around hundreds of thousands of dollar in an average STEM university and if the rule is not passed not many would prefer to come to these prestigious universities, thus sidelining america in a way over the next few years.  Many of the greatest scientists America has produced have been non-immigrants and thus had they not come to here the world would have missed out on some greatest innovations. \n\n2. Some of the major companies would then want to shift their base to other countries as its the quality of the employee that would help the companies growth and not the fact whether he is an American or not. Thus this can be seen as a form of racism that would certainly raise issues. \n\nI would like for the USCIS to not only pass this rule, but also consider expanding H1B visa availability for STEM graduates of US universities. We were trained by your professors (most of whom were immigrants themselves), and we spent thousands of dollars coming to America to get access to opportunity and provide a lot of value in return.

Majority of the international students come to U.S. for education are from STEM majors; and OPT extension becomes an attractive factor to bring excellent students to U.S comparing with other countries, which will boost the economical growth of the country from the financial aspect, such as real estate, tourism, and education. For example, the cancellation of OPT extension will result in a significant drop in the amount of money coming to the public colleges and universities, which will negatively influence the education quality.\n\n2. Instead of hijacking the job opportunity from native residents, international students create more job opportunities in the U.S. market. Most of international students from STEM majors are actively serving in different fields of the high-level technology related jobs, assuring the stability and development of the companies' or institutions' businesses, that generates more derivative positions for U.S. residents.\n\n3. Although this new policy seems to increase the competition levels, generally it is a good thing for the country's sustainability and development in the long term. Competition could improve the overall quality of the potential employees for both U.S. and non-U.S. residents. This could make U.S. become more competitive globally.

It is upon this that the greatness of this nation is built on. \n\nAnother factor to note, tuition from international students has become one of the major income for some US universities. cancellation of OPT extension will definitely drive international students away from applying to US universities, they might otherwise prefer schools in UK / Canada where the policies are more welcoming, which effectively affects US colleges - especially public ones. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Haozhen Ding", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16178", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am a Computer Science master student in the US, now in F-1 status.

One example could be Operation Paperclip, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) program in which over 1,500 German scientists, engineers, and technicians from Nazi Germany and other foreign countries were brought to the United States for employment. Their contributions to the development of science and technology during the Cold War also helped the US defeat the Soviet Union.\n\nNowadays, the world is largely driven by the high technology and every country is desperate to attract more talented people to build its own power.

In the past century, US has maintained its global influence in the world by defending the human rights of everyone. Everyone should be treated with dignity no matter what his/her background is. Moreover, US needs this diverseness of cultural backgrounds to spread its essential values to the world. If all these young international graduates are treated with lies and lack of empathy, it will do more harm than benefits to the US fellows. For example, most international students are paying much higher tuitions in order to keep more domestic students receiving their education in schools. Offering recent graduates an opportunity to get work experience at US companies also benefits these companies and the society. The approval of this rule will also attract more talented students coming in and thus maintain US's global competitiveness.

After approval of this rule we will get curricular practice in our field. It give chance to implement our ideas in corporate companies. Try to help in research work which will help USA to grow faster. \n\nIf this rule will not get pass then it will affect hugely on current as well as future coming talent to USA. I got many inquire from India whether they should apply or not in USA universities? Is it right option or shall we go to Germany? I told them, we have trust on USA government procedure & they will fix this problem soon. Hope for best\n\nAs per my view, the positive & negative points of this rule are as follows:\nPositive:\n1) It will give right message to International student that US universities are best option to study than other country. \nOtherwise there will be great impact on future coming talent (Cream of indian talent as well as from all countries).\n\n2) It give justice to current student who planned there investment & many student have loan on there shoulder for education. We can get good practical experience also.\n\n3)  Right now, many of us are working on research projects, also working in different sectors (automobile, electrical, aerospace,Medical field). Company provided us lot of training & if we need to leave in middle of projects. They will loose money & trained resource. In future, they will not hire OPT student also. if they cannot fill all highly educated jobs then company will have to move to other countries like India, china or Germany. If students are just doing MS & going back to there country then they can give increase great competition against USA company by providing highly educated employees (MS,MBA) with less salary in India/china. US citizen may loose many jobs if company needs to shift plant to other countries due to competition. No Indian will wish that any US citizen to loose job we work together as a family.\n\n4) We help to create more jobs in USA in different sector & levels which help US citizen also. \n\n5) We are paying highly taxes which helps USA economy to grow faster. \n\n\n6) There are 0.3 million application comes every year for 80000 seats of H1B visa. This rule will give same number of chances whenever you graduate . If you graduate in may then people are getting once chance less than December graduates for applying H1B visa. hence it is observed Dec graduation is more. This new 24 month rule will give same number of attempt for H1B whether you gratuate in may or December month that is fair justice for all.\n\n\nNegative points: \nNow I will tell Negative points as per my view are as follows:\n\n1) Companies will not hire stem OPT as regular because there are many documentation they need to maintain, they need to provide trainer, mentor. Training report every six month, growth plan and all. Which will force to company to give low preference to higher STEM OPT students. This condition needs to modify.\n\nI feel there is only 1 negative point for new rule. It made really great after proper brainstorming by experts. i respect there decisions. Hoping for best. Please continue & approve this new stem OPT rule for 24 months.\n\nRegards,\nName: Tushar Patil\n\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tushar Patil", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10099", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE as the U.S. should keep those high demanded talents working for this country.

I personally went to various career fairs and visited tens of companies. None of them prefers international students to domestic students. In the contrary, many of these companies prefer domestic students as these companies need to spend much more effort to accommodate the special needs of international students, such as their status in the United States. Thus international students are not taking jobs away from domestic students.

It is unreasonable to connect the augment of foreign students with the decline of wage level which is caused by the global financial crisis. And after the 2008 GFC many countries are in the great recession except for America, because America is a comprehensive society which allow more foreign students to establish a business so that not only there is more job opportunities provided but also increasing the government tax income.\nFurther, foreign students basically has nothing to do with the minimum wage and they should not be responsible for the stagnation of software and the Internet industry wage growth. The real reasons are the outsourcing and industry progress to slow down. The cause of the former is that we refuse to retain foreign students and companies tend to find cheaper foreign programmers who has little experience in the USA. The latter is on the account for the decrease of innovation, which is actually the result of foreign students going back home because we have chased away the elites we fostered by ourselves!\nDriving away foreign students may bring brief relief, but it will go against the America's long-term strategic interests, especially the common people's vital interests. With the loss of elites in foreign students, jobs will drift to cheaper areas abroad so that the American innovation will dry up. When we look back the development in Internet of China in two years, we could find that almost all the entrepreneurs have experience to study abroad.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs.

Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program.

It's universal believed that the situation in the company is quite different the one in the university. The future dream job one assumed as a graduate student might not be suitable for him when he works in the company. And one can never know whether his dream job matches his own interest and ability until he is experiencing what is his job. But for international students, especially for the top-level STEM talents, twelve months is too short to get to know which area they want to contribute to for their whole life, especially for those who find that he cannot make full use of his various abilities in his present job and wish to switch to another job.\n\nThose top-level STEM talents have studied really hard for almost 24-28 years to foster the various abilities, but will be compelled to choose the certain job in twelve months. Don't you think it's too ridiculous? How can they think critically to decide whether the job matches him and whether he matches the job in such a short period? However, the fact is if they don't choose a job quickly, they will be forced to leave America, the land they love and wish to contribute to.\n\nSome may argue that such top-level STEM talents will compete the job opportunities with the native residents. However, I'd like to point out that without the influx of international talents, our science and technology, even the economy, will lose the energy and therefore our citizens will enjoy fewer opportunities. STEM talents are not taking jobs away from the citizens. On the contrary, they are creating more job opportunities by contributing to the development of high technology.

The graduates from STEM majors has been making vital contribution to the US economy. The IT industry has developed very fast in the recent years relying on many foreign students who graduated from different STEM majors, which also creates many positions for Americans. The development of economy helps building up more companies and hiring more American people. Also, they pay a significant part of tax which helps the federal and state governments better serve the people.\n\n2. The international students with STEM degree is an important part to keep the USA the most powerful country. We are facing a competition from China, Russia and India in technology and economy every day, and the majority of the foreign students in science and engineering are from these countries. The current immigration law makes it very hard for these students to work legally in the United States even if they are hired by the high-tech companies. If we force them to return to their home country, they will only support the tech companies in their country and our highest level education system is just teaching and training students who work for our competitors. By setting up this OPT-extension, these students will have a chance to work in the United States and contribute to the industry here for at least 3 years and possibly longer if they apply for other types of visa later.\n\n3. Please also be aware that for most Ph.D. students and some master students, the tuition fee and some of the living expenses are covered fully or partially by a fund from the university. This is eventually paid by all tax payers, that is, every American. If we force these students to return to their home country right after graduation, we are effectively using our tax-payers' money to educate future workers for our competitors. This will definitely hurt the USA in the very near future and we should figure out a way to fix it. OPT extension is a temporary way to deal with this.\n\n4. The international students in STEM fields will not have a bad impact for local workers. First, the STEM industry is in lack of human resource, so that a foreign student in those fields does not \"occupy\" a position for local workers. Second, the STEM field is highly paid and this is way beyond the minimum wage. For example, a fresh graduate software engineer who works in Google gets paid more than $50 per hour, which by no means keeps the minimum wage from growing.\n\nFor all the reasons above, I support the proposal by the DHS on OPT extension, and I also hope that the federal government and congress can figure out a long term solution to make it easier for highly educated talents to stay in the US -- this will help keep the USA the most powerful country in the future.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Darren Pinkman", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19312", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new rule, which actually will benefit the economy, technology and the whole society of the U.S.\nAll those students enrolled in PhD of STEM areas are smart, hard working and highly devoted to the development of science\nand technology in the US.

However, the companies, such as Apple, Google, Amazon and so on, hired students who mainly majored in STEM. These companies have important roles in America's Economy. If this proposal is not approved, the majority of international students must go back to their own countries. That means these companies would not hire enough students to help them because most Americans are majored in Medicine, Law  and Film. Then these companies will become weaker and weaker. Therefore, this phenomenon will affect America's Economy seriously.\n\nSecondly, this proposal will benefit both international students and United States. This proposal will give international students three years to work in and contribute to America, which means each international student will have three opportunities to get H1B visa. This will benefit international student a lot. Besides, if more and more international students get H1B visa, they will contribute to America a lot and therefore, United States will become stronger and stronger and will be a leader in technique filed around the world.\n\nFinally, this proposal will attract more and more international students come to United States and this will be a huge amount of income. Besides, this proposal will keep United States at the top position in education around in the world. Many students want to have industry experience after they graduation. The OPT is one of the main reasons which attract international students come to America. Recently, many other countries, such as Canada, United Kingdom and Austria, are considering to propose training program similar to OPT in order to attract international students. Therefore, in this competitive world, United States should open mind and take this good proposal.\n\nIn sum, I strongly support this proposal and this proposal will benefit both international students and America.

The prosperity of US and its dominating status in science and engineering industry is substantially because of the contributions from STEM talents coming from all around the world. Rejecting the international students/talents to work here after their graduation is a big loss to US economy development, and will be detrimental to the healthy of society as a whole in the long run. Longer OPT should help them to polish their technical skills and most importantly let those STEM talents contribute to the overall industry, and therefore bring up more job opportunities for US.\n\nSecondly, the longer STEP OPT will be more attractive to talents around the world, and helps to bring in even more of them to contribute to US. US has been doing an job in providing OPT for Stem students, and the policy has won a lot more international talents over other countries, such as UK. Without it, US will lose the edge, and be a lot less competitive. Why not providing a more attractive policy and drawing the best talented people to work for US? It is ridiculous to give up the STEM talents, and push them away. US needs the talents to build an even stronger country.  \n\nAlso, 24 months extension is most appropriate. Because most of the projects in industry and research fields go about 2~3 years long. The companies and research centers cannot bear the loss for having the STEM talents leaving during the projects, because of the current limited OPT duration. With the new extension, mutual benefits can be established, both for the students and the US companies/research centers. The industries can make the most of the international Stem talents before they leave. In the long term, this policy will no doubt enhance the US development in STEM fields, and benefit the US economy as a whole--lifting up the living standard, lowering the unemployment rates and so on.\n\nTherefore, US government should support the new 24 OPT extension policy for international STEM talents to work in US for longer time, for the best of US.

Without extension, I only have 12 months to stay in US. This means once I am familiar with the work, my deadline is just there.  Once I am ready to create more value for US, I have to leave. Of course, I can apply for H-1 B to stay longer. But,  I will graduate this December 2015 and if I want to stay in US after that 12 month, the best way is to find a job with H-1 B sponsor before April 2016(Because there is only one chance to be selected in H1B every year), and I only have one chance with 12 month. This means I only have 3 months to find such job after my graduation and if I fail to find the sponsored job before April, I do not have any extra chance to apply for H1B.  This might have several consequences. First, I might  not have motivation to work so hard for that company, because I know it does not matter how hard I work, I can not work for that company longer once my OPT is due. Second, the company need to waste a lot of money hiring new people and training them. The thing needs to be pointed out is that these new hired people might also be F-1 students, and thus it is a bad cycle for the company because once the new people is ready for the work, they might need to go because of limited OPT. Therefore, if OPT is short, both students and companies can be in an unstable situation, this is not good for the US economy. \n\nSecond,24-months extension is better than 17 month extension. The objective of OPT Extension is to allow most intelligent , most skillful ,and most useful student have opportunity to stay in US sharpen their skills and devote to US. Then why not giving these  satisfied students more time? If they are not good enough, they will be eliminated naturally;but if they are good, why not being more generous to them and giving them more time to show their value and let you know they deserve?Every stem student in US is not only spending a lot of money in US, but also always has skills you want. They always worked so hard in their home country to be outstanding enough to get the offer in US university. They are prepared for the world and can be shining in every country. Then why you do not take this advantage to use them? \n\nThird, with more extension,students can find a career without considering too much about the due day of their OPT. If OPT is not long enough, students have to consider too much about their status,because before they have enough experience, the status crisis is already around the corner.

I will say, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: \n\n1. The longer OPT is a significant factor when I decided to study abroad in America as a master in Computer Engineering. As is know, America is leading the world in this area. The problem is that, I can hardly learn much within only two years studying, which means the OPT after my graduation is really important if I want to get more experience for my future career. Without the longer OPT, why wouldn't I just go to Canada or England, or even Australia? \n\n2. I can hardly imagine how I am supposed to get myself fully devoted into my job, to my company while I clearly know that I will be \"fired\" one year later? I don't think there are few people like me. Then there will be no more company hiring international STEM students because no one can guarantee to provide the H1B to them even if they contribute a lot to the company. \n\n3. Some commenters stated that companies preferred F-1 students only because they can work with lower wages. I'm wondering have they ever made any investigation as to support their opinions? People have to be responsible for what they've said, especially something like this. I've hardly seen any F-1 student get lower salary because of his/her international student identity. Lower pay can only result from less competitive capabilities. Besides, some other commenters argued that job opportunities should be preserved for Americans as many of them could not find a job. Really? I thought America is country of inclusion. Anyone can get a job as long as he/she is qualified for it, irrespective of where they come from. And I think this is one of most important reason for America's being one of the most powerful country in the world. If it reject competitive labor as to protect local labor, will it always keep its position in the world? \n\n\nPlease consider about it. Most F-1 students share no interest in immigration.

Why them bother to do so? Why them decide to choose these challenging fields? Because many of them seek to gain working experience and the opportunity to put their knowledge into Practice after graduation. And stem OPT extension is necessary for them to achieve this goal.\n\nI am currently doing my PhD research in a State University and our University is also a famous Engineering School. I observe that more and more kids from my country, China, choose my school for their undergraduate and graduate study(Master programs in majority). And the most of them go to stem majors.\n\nThese students bring money. Can you image how much money they bring to US? Most American students in our school are from Virginia and they pay in-state tuition while these Chinese Kids have to pay international tuition which is much higher than in-state tuition. In these two years our school is doing a large renovation project. We are building new dorm for incoming international students. We are expanding our parking lot. We are building more dining halls. We are extending our library, etc. I notice even the assistantship for graduate students has been increased. All these changes requires large amount of money. As a state university we may not have the chance to receive huge amount of donation compared with private university so I believe the tuition paid by international student contributes at least 90 percent of the cost.\nNo doubt American kids benefits a lot from all the things above. More money means better facilities, better professors, larger gym and library, bigger parking lot, and more.\n\nThese students bring more jobs. On one hand, our university are hiring more staffs and professors to satisfy these large group of incoming students. On the other hand, the local business starting to flourish. Our town is a typically college town which was kind of boring. But in this year, several new restaurants, two new Starbucks and a brand new IMAX movie theatre start to serve. Foreign students bring money and jobs. And with more money and more job, our school and our town is getting better and better. And more American Kids will choose our school. Its a  virtuous circle.\n\nIf the new stem OPT extension policy fails to pass, US universities are no longer attractive. Students will go to other countries(Japan, Europe, Canada, Australia) to receive same level high quality education without paying the ridiculous high tuition(Tuition of US university is the highest in the world). Education is no doubt one of the most important parts of American Economy.

Im an international student from China and in my master of Biochem study in US.  When I was about to get my bachelor degree in China, I decided to receive graduate education abroad. Besides USA, I also considered other countries like Canada, Singapore, UK, etc. A main reason that the graduate education in US attracted me (and many other international students, I believe) is the OPT extension which gives an excellent opportunity for the students to accumulate experience and training in industry world after graduation. If this opportunity gets cancelled, the education institutes in US will lose attraction to those international students when they compare with other target countries. This is a loss for the US education industry in the global market.\nThe experience in industry that OPT offers can benefit the students to find job after they return to their home countries. With all my family members and memories in China, I will come back to China eventually. But before that, if I can apply what I learn in schools to the US high-tech industry development, that will make me much more competitive in the job market in China. Many research projects would last for more than one year. If the OPT is only one year, foreign STEM workers cannot work on those projects because they will face VISA issue before project completion. \nLastly, some American propose to terminate this rule because of the fear to possible competition brought by the foreign students during OPT. I would say competition is always there. Less foreign students doesn't mean a job opportunity for an unqualified worker.  Why the companies should hire those domestic unqualified workers instead of just direct outsource to foreign companies with a much favorable price, and the staff in the foreign company might have studied in US but cannot stay because of the VISA issue. If that would happen, I think it is greater loss for the country of USA.

As a master student, experience is very important for us. However, most of masters in US are all taking classes.  We seldom have chance to have projects with professor like PHD student. So the work experience after our graduation is really important. But the 12 months(maybe less) OPT period is even not enough for us to get familiar with our job. How can we get enough work experience in shortly 12 months? In our own country, the 3-year master degree mode is quite similar to the PHD degree in US, which means, they already have 3 years project or work experience right after their graduation. That makes the US master student really disadvantaged when seeking job together with them in job market. And STEM extension program can make us get competitive in the job market. The STEM extension program is an important reason for us to decide to achieve degrees in US. And this policy is cancelled, it will cause a lot of students give up their plan to study in US and choose some other country like Canada and England, or just achieve degree in our country. So the extension is really important for our future career and development.\n\n2. I think in a country like US, diversity is very important. For example, international companies may have sites outside US. If they have employees from these countries, they may have some useful suggestions. And in US history, a lot of huge contributions are made by foreigners who had US education background. Assume they didn't get chance to work in US, we could not live the life like that.

How ridiculous.  We already have enough employment issues in this country for our legal citizens.  \n\nIs this proposal another way for the government to interfere with a free market system by over-ruling normal supply and demand practices with financial incentives for employers to hire people the government prefers?  This seems discriminatory to me.  Is this an affirmative action plan for foreigners?  \n\nThis proposal seems unfair as A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand: OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nI am from Iowa and my Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama) wrote:\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nI consider Senator Grassley's thoughts and concerns on this matter well stated and appropriate.  I support his objections and stand behind him as I truly believe he represents the best interests of all US citizens.  We don't need more regulations that benefit non-citizens over US citizens.  The government already can't keep track of illegals or others who overstayed their legal visas.  I certainly don't think this will help with National Security issues.  And I resent the method of dangling a carrot (financial incentive) to employers to help insure participation.  Please reconsider this plan.

This proposal will give international students three years to work in and contribute to America, which means each international student will have three opportunities to get H1B visa.

Some people argue that the employers tend to hire OPT students so that they could save the 7.65% tax. But do you know that these employers are actually paying much, much more than the tax? Not to mention that most PhD students ARE actually paying their taxs as normal citizens do because they have been in American for more than 5 years. To support the foreign employees for H1B or whatever other visa, the employers have to pay for more than 40k for each employee. Does any of these employee has an annual salary above 522k? \n\n2. So why are those employers willing to pay for such a huge amount of money to keep international employees? Actually they are not. Given two similarly qualified job candidates, being one American citizen and one international students, there is no reason that an employer would hire someone with higher cost and worse language/culture fitness. However, the truth is, the number of native Americans in STEM fields is shrinking, and many international students are highly competent in these fields. So the result is, on one hand, not too many American candidates available; on the other hand, many highly qualified and motivated international students are awaiting. \n\n3. Research/development in STEM fields are often highly collaborative. One reason that STEM fields is thriving in America is that the American culture emphasizes on diversity: diversity in education, personally, and perspectives. It is ironic that under a modern culture labeling itself with diversity, Asian students are often related to stereotypes of being nerdy, and when it comes to job market, instead, people think they don't need those nerdy guys any more.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wentao Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21834", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "i strongly support the new opt rule proposed by DHS.

This creates a positive image of US welcoming international talents to work for US companies. I did an internship at one of the top IT companies, during which time I worked with people from India, China, England, Czech, and of course with people from the US. What strikes me most is that when you put people with different background into the same team, they bring different ways of thinking, and that often leads to innovative solutions. I think this diversity is indeed one of the reasons why many US companies such as Google and Facebook are so successful.\n\nThe diversity in hiring also helps the US companies to get a better understanding of the differences of countries in the world, which in turns helps the companies to exert global impact. I cannot say about other areas, but I think most IT companies today realize this importance of global hiring and diversity of employee background.\n\nNow, some people have argued against this OPT extension because they want to create more jobs for the Americans. While their intention is understandable, I have to argue that if they want to create more jobs for the Americans, they should support the OPT extension instead of going against it, and here is why:\n\nConsider some of the most successful IT companies like Google and Facebook. Many such companies have sites across the globe. If the OPT extension is denied, these companies would be forced to focus more on non-US sites for hiring global talents. Instead of creating more jobs for local American people, denying the OPT extension is actually encouraging US companies to spend resources on other countries instead of on their US sites.\n\nOn the other hand, more foreign companies, such as Baidu and Tencent from China, are increasingly adopting the strategy of coming to US and directly hire US talents. Without the OPT extension, it would make US companies like Google and Facebook very difficult to fight the war of hiring the best people for the job.\n\nWe have to realize one thing: if the company is not doing well, there won't be any job for anybody. As for the students that uses the OPT extension to work for US companies, we should not view them as enemies that steal American jobs. Instead, I suggest we view them as catalyst to the growth of the company and ultimately the US economy: having the OPT extension would send a signal that the US welcomes global talents, which would give US companies advantage in hiring global talents, which in turn helps the growth of US companies and US economy, and ultimately leads to more jobs, for American people.

AND think of the Americans that will be going on welfare..... Soon it will be your turn.......\n\n    The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\n    The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\n    The time to fix this problem is now, not after millions of illegals have gained residency and created homes in this country..  With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\n    The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nI oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.

We contributed to the academic development, helped sustained the diversity of the campus, and made US students and ourselves better. International students paid extra effort to study and compete in an foreign environment with native students who had language advantage, and many of us stood out with excellence to participate and contribute to researches and the extension of the academic reputations of our institutions. \n\n2.

We paid much more tuition to support these universities and colleges financially so that AMERICAN CITIZEN will be less likely to have education problem when many schools cannot operate as well as before or even shut down due to lack of income under the fiscal circumstance with the weak support of US government. \n\nWithout the possibility to work after graduation in US, the amount of international students will decrease rapidly, which directly threatens the education of US CITIZEN.\n\n3. Having international students working in US legally stimulates the economy as a whole in the way that corporations with quality employees have the opportunity to keep a fast pace of development and expand, which leads to more jobs. If US only keeps things to itself, then its unique advantage in many industries and the economic growth as a whole will be at stake, because US is facing the problem of population crisis and US citizen only may not be able to support the need for human capital of the society.

Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans. That is why the President has consistently advocated for commonsense comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would help certain foreign students who graduate with STEM degrees to stay here and contribute to our economy by providing these individuals with avenues to obtain lawful permanent residence (or \"green cards\").\n\nLast November, the President announced a number of reforms designed to fix parts of our broken immigration system -- including actions to strengthen the Optional Practical Training (OPT) STEM program. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security published a proposed regulation to accomplish this goal. DHS is inviting the public, including students, colleges and universities, and employers, to review its proposed reforms and provide feedback by November 18, 2015. After DHS reviews and considers all public comments, it plans to publish a final rule.\nSummary (official):\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to amend its F-1 nonimmigrant student visa regulations on optional practical training (OPT) for certain students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from U.S. institutions of higher education. Specifically, the proposal would allow such F-1 STEM students who have elected to pursue 12 months of OPT in the United States to extend the OPT period by 24 months (STEM OPT extension). This 24-month extension would effectively replace the 17-month STEM OPT extension currently available to certain STEM students. The rule also improves and increases oversight over STEM OPT extensions by, among other things, requiring the implementation of formal mentoring and training plans by employers, adding wage and other protections for STEM OPT students and U.S. workers, and allowing extensions only to students with degrees from accredited schools.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Neh Kovale", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-6039", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "In the education sector a teacher friend experienced the effects of importing teacher trainees a few years ago.

I fear that lack of oversight will have a similar outcome in STEM fields.\n\nI'm all in favor of giving foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but agree that today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. I'm afraid that employers are only too happy to take on less demanding lower-paid folks (saving 7.65% when hiring foreign students instead of U.S. workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program). OPT workers frequently hold jobs in the $60-$90000/yr. range but cost Social Security approximately $1 billion per year. This reduces opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nI would suggest leveling the playing field. Mandate that STEM jobs be posted for U.S. STEM applicants first.

Without OPT and its extension program, the value of studying in US is negatively impacted. \n\n(2) I strongly support of the 24-month extension of OPT for STEM student. As the nature of many civil and environmental engineering work, the project cycle spans from 2 years to 5 years based on my experiences. Without the 24-month OPT extension, many US organization will have higher turnover rate of employees and possible higher operational for training and higher HR costs for recruiting efforts with little added value. With the 24-month extension of OPT, US companies will be able to better strategize development plan in a reasonable time frame. Meanwhile, STEM students in the 24-month extension phase are very likely more efficient with adequate training.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, I am not able to make and obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, and I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for getting STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief back to us, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding a longer OPT to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacate of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule making. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacate should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly support the OPT Extension and I am 100% sure that we could make contribution to this country and the world.\nThank you.\n \nSincerely,\nYL", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yingda Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5194", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I highly agree with for the OPT extension for international students:\n\n1.

There are several reasons behind that.\n\nFirst, this rule will attract more STEM talents to US, which will make its academic sector remain competitive globally. Take me as an example, after I got my bachelor degree, I was seeking for a higher degree. I got offers from universities in Canada, Singapore, UK, Australia, and so on. But at last I chose US. This is because in America I have a better chance to get a industrial training opportunity, so that I can be more competitive when I back to my country. However, without OPT extension, it will be very difficult to get a job, and I might change my idea to study in State. I believe this consideration is very common among all the foreign STEM students in America. \n\nSecondly, local economy will be greatly benefit from more international students.\nTake my school, Colorado State University as an example. In Fort Collins, most of restaurants, apartments, supermarkets are supported by international students. Most  apartments are rented by international students. And those restaurants are opened because of the need of students from various countries. If fewer and fewer international students come to US, there will not be those demands. New restaurant/supermarket/etc will not be opened, which means fewer job opportunity for local residents. Apartment will be harder to rent out, which means local resident will have less income. In a word, new OPT extension rule will be beneficial to the local and even whole States economy. \n\nAt last, not only for government, but also for US companies, this extension is a better choice. In most high-tech companies, the project will last at least  2 years or more. If the OPT plus its extension is 12+24 months, the plan for the research/development will be more flexible and viable. If worker under OPT status has to leave US because the OPT termination, it will be a big problem. \n\nAll in all, DHSs proposal about OPT extension is good for both STEM students and US government. If the DHSs proposal is denied, STEM talents are more willingly to go to other countries having better policies, which will harm the academic strength, local economy, research group and companies.

This proposal will attract more international students to come to US for studying, which at least directly will stimulate the economy in US. The training opportunities are really important to international students. Lots of students choose to come to US instead of other countries for this training opportunity.\n\n2.

Giving more opportunities to international students is a good tradition in the history of US. Moreover, it really works very well. So we should stick with this policy and enhance it.\n\n3. International students won't affect domestic students very much. Despite the competition, the number of international students is still very small compared with domestic students. International students just take some positions for which the company cannot find qualified domestic students. So international students help US business.\n\nThere are other future benefits of this proposal which cannot be specified here since it is just a comment.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\t\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\tthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\t\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\t\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\t\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nCompanies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap foreign labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Ken Southworth", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3234", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal.

The OPT program definitely helps students to gain more industry experience and better prepare them for finding a job in their home country.

With low probability of winning the H1b visa, the OPT extension is definitely needed to ensure a complete training.  It also benefits American companies because they dont need to find a new employee every year to replace those who are on OPT and dont win the H1b visa lottery.

Excluding immigrants into U.S is not good for national development. This proposal is for the benefit of those foreign students who have the skills and knowledge to work in this country, it's not for the students who are lack of skills. So the students who can stay longer in US according to this proposal are TALENTS.Talents would only make the US citizens' structure better. \nAlso, this proposal is just intended to extend the OPT for STEMS, it's not a promise to allow all the foreign students to become US citizens. Even this proposal is approved, the foreign students still have to apply for H1B later, and then green card. Only a small part of them will successfully get the green card. I think this proposal is intended to allow the foreign students a little more time to make contributions to this country. It's true that some US citizens lost their job opportunities to some talented foreign students, but it's not a problem of the foreign students. Will a skilled and educated US citizen lose the job to a foreign student? NO. If Apple clears out all the non-citizen programmers, can all the positions be filled by citizens without affecting the company's development? NO. It's a law that the strong survived everywhere. If US governments let the foreign students go back to their home countries once they completed their degrees here, then the students would apply the knowledge got in US to develop their home countries, then US will have more competitors around the world especially in the technology field. US government should create better environment for the talented immigrants to stay longer. In this way, the country develops better and more people have the motivation to study and work harder.

We can no longer put money or jobs out on foreigners.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nGeneral Facts About The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):\n\nThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.  Right now Americans need jobs.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\nThe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:  the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\nSam Rolley of Personal Liberty:\n\n\"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.\"\n\n\"a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.\"\n\n\"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\"\n\nWith the state of our country right now, we actually should eliminate the program.  Any foreign student who wants to go to school here will pay their own way and for their own support.  No one stays after graduation nor works while they are attending school.  Americans must all be working and as for school, Americans should be paying far less than they currently are. It has become another avenue for our government to slide more foreigners into our country and increase our deficit.

The reasons are as follows:\n\n1. The OPT program has good intentions to allow international students to intern at US companies and therefore contribute directly to US economy. Without such program, many students simple acquire the education in US (best in the world) but go back afterwards and apply their knowledge in home countries, leaving minimal benefit to the US economy.\n\n2.  Although with good intentions, the 1-year period is too short for the students to effectively contribute in most of the engineering or science field. Most of meaningful projects in any STEM-related companies has R&D cycle considerably longer than several months, not to consider that the academic-industry transition requires some time for any fresh graduates to adjust. This leads to less effective utilization of the OPT program, both from perspectives of the students and the companies.\n\n3. A longer OPT allows US companies to be more flexible in acquiring talents in the STEM field. More time and effort can be spent in identifying compatible candidates, rather than selecting merely based on work authorizations. Only through a much broader, diverse talent pool, the US companies can maintain their edge in innovations in the world.\n\n4.

This country has been built by hard-working immigrants from all over the world and absolutely needs to continue to embrace diversity. As a fellow American, I feel ashamed to see some of the xenophobic comments posted here. \n\nHere is some facts:\n\nAbout 25 percent of the U.S. scientific workforce consists of foreign-born scientists, in both industry and academia. But this statistic understates the crucial role these scientists play in sustaining U.S. preeminence in basic research. A better number is 49 percent: foreign scientists fill nearly half of the mid-level positions that make up the backbone of the scientific labor force at U.S. research universities. These journeyman scientists, known as postdocs, are highly trained researchers who work in temporary positions for relatively low pay. Most higher-level jobs in scientific research require some postdoctoral experience after graduate school, so university faculty can easily staff their labs with well-trained, newly minted Ph.D.-holders who will work for a few years at a relatively low salary, in exchange for career mentorship. Together with the graduate students, postdocs handle the test tubes, write the computer code, and author many of the research papers. Without postdocs, much of the science produced in U.S. labs would not get done.\n\nIt is time to stop being narrow-minded and selfish. STEM students (American or foreign) contribute a great deal to scientific advancements in this country. Limiting opportunities for any STEM students would certainly have a negative impact on the prosperity of this country. \n\nIn addition, last time I checked, anyone working legally in the US has to pay taxes whether he or she is a US resident or not. Therefore, the argument of foreign STEM workers not contributing to US economy or tax system is simply false.\n\nBy the way, while we are on the topic of immigration, what are we doing about unskilled and potentially dangerous illegal immigrants crossing our borders everyday? \n\nThis country needs skilled immigrants who are willing to follow rules of our government and able to contribute to society.

These consultants do very basic and cheap contractor work for US IT companies.\"]\n\n--- I admit this is a legal loophole in H1B visa. I guess DHS didn't realize these Indian firms will make every effort to push the consultant to abuse H1B, by filing many companies for one person. This loophole incurs the exponential growth of technical immigrants who do not have a degree in US, and many talented students not able to apply for H1B and GC to stay in US due to limited quota, and that's why DHS never erged to increase the quota.  But anyway, this has nothing to do with OPT, for OPT is only for US graduated foreign students.\n\nFor your second argument, if there were no market for contractors, these firms wouldn't survive. Almost all big and medium companies including FLAG are hiring contractors to save money and avoid legal risks. OPTs and H1s should find a position in any of the companies so that the firms can earn profits. Contractors are paid the same as employees and only lack benefits, and more importantly, hiring by contract does not distinguish working status since it's temporary. In fact, many STEM engineers who are US citizens are contractors. On the other hands, contractor work may not be basic. Again, why should an e-verified company (A promise for OPT extension) pay for a foreigner who has more status instability, higer legal risks, and less fluent English with high salary? Think about it.\n\n[\"More importantly, US companies which do not find qualified US workers should invest more in training young US people instead of importing foreign labor\"]\n\n---- Education is a complex and very long-term issue. As I see US government does spend much on education (at least comparing to China). Foreign students pay 3x higher tuitions than in-states in public school, and I believe the money mostly will be eventually used for education. The biggest beneficiaries are American students since they have overwhelmed advantage in population. And I do think American students do not perform good at mathematics, which is the foundamental skill for STEM positions. SAT and GMAT quantitative is just Chinese's secondary school level difficulty. I think that's a reason local stem workers are not so competitive.\n\n[\"I believe there is common ground and I post my comments to the OPT extension rule about how to improve the new rule to protect US workers legitimate rights\n\n1) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.\n2)OPT program should only be available for students from top 50-100 US universities, the current provision \"accredited Universities\" is too vague.\"]\n\n---- 1. USCIS does have that. Some firms are closed due to visa abuse.\n2. rank is biased. Every university has its character. As long as a foreign student can be legally hired, he/she is talented. The problem is not the students, but the questionnable firms.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Joshua Tsui", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14864", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I agree with this extension policy for OPT for the following reasons:\n\n1.OPT provides needed talents to the US. OPT does NOT mean every foreign people get easily get a job in the US. Firstly the need to graduate from the US college/graduate school. Secondly they need to find a job, that the employer really think they are the people will make contribution to the company. The fact is a lot of student can't really find a job during the OPT time and go back to their country. The ones got chance to stay here are really creating values for this nation.\n\n2.OPT is a fair policy, and it is attracting more talents to the US. International students paid more than 3x of tuition than local students, to provide a chance of internship here is fair. This policy shows the US is a country welcomes talents, people with American dreams. As more people coming, more money will be brought here. \n\n3.OPT is not really \"hurting\" citizenship, it is a good way for election of immigration. Some people may think this is hurting citizenship, but in fact OPT just provides a chance for work, temporally. To say hurting citizenship just because we provide some jobs equal to foreign people and citizens is not objective. In the OPT period, we can get a chance to know who are the people we want to offer them an immigration chance. Talents stay, other go back, this is the reason why the US is called immigration country, and why it is the strongest nation in the world. It is not hurting citizenship, but a way to improve the quality of this citizenship.\n\n4.Currently, to many STEM fields need talents. If you are working in some high tech company, you know how difficult it is to hire a talent. OPT extension is not for every international students, but only STEM, which related to the high tech industry. The new grads from other countries are really working hard. the values they make are obviously benefiting our nation and people.\n\nTo deny this policy just because worrying more talents come and the employing standard will be increase is not positive for this nation. We increased our nation power and life quality by increase the \"talent bar\" for the past years, and it successes. To support this policy is a challenge with huge opportunities, it is benefiting the nation, and will bring even more than what we see today.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Luke Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13040", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This a good rule which will benefit America in Science and Technology aspect by retaining the foreign talent.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sridhar Reddy Shyamala", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-0197", "postedDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "What dose America spirit mean?\nHow dose America grow up?\nWhy dose America not like Europe, but grows stronger and stronger?\n\nIf the sympathy for the weak can help country grow?\nIf exclude elites can help country in long term?\n\nPlease think about that.\n\nIf I think falsely about America, please give up this rule", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yufei Feng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21628", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "expanding this opt is really important because most of Internet cooperations could have more power and fresh blood to proceed, which could improve all American's life", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yifei Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14359", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is necessary to drive foreign hi-tech labors away to U.S.'s competitors.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.>", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Mike Jackson", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3995", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We need to stop exporting our high tech jobs and stop passing over Millions of unemployed Americans for foreigners on visas.

Considering the limited number of H1b visa provided each year, and relatively high risk of failing in the H1b lottery, STEM companies will be significantly discouraged to hire any foreign students who are newly graduated. However, the fact that how fast H1b visas are running out each year can easily tell us that there are huge need for foreign employee in those fields such as IT, statistics, chemical engineering, etc. \n\nAssume there is a IT company A, each year needs to hire 5 new data scientist, which is a position requiring much math, statistics and CS algorithm knowledge. Because there are strict standard for foreign labor to apply H1b visa, technically already protecting the Priority for a similarly qualified US person to get hired in ahead of a foreign person.

Under the old OPT extension policy, which allows foreign people to work in US for more than two years before being able to get their H1b, everything goes well for company A and the 3 foreign workers: the 3 foreign workers, even with bad luck not being able to obtain their H1b permit at last, can work in company A for about two years as proficient worker after the 6 months training.\n\nOnce the OPT extension gets cancelled, it will be immediately put company A in an embarrassing dilemma: if they keep hiring 3 foreign worker each year, they put themselves in a huge risk that those workers may only be able to work for 3 or 4 months after get well trained to be proficient, and have to leave US because the one-year OPT is expired.  Consider the low ratio of H1b visa approved each year, it is highly likely to occur without the OPT extension.\n\nAnd similar case will not only happen to company A, also company B, company C, company D, company Google, company Apple, company Ford, company Fisher Scientific, ...etc. Once this type of problems get accumulated, it will really be too late to feel regret when seeing US gdp increase goes down as a result. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qing Guo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-16198", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:\n1.

Both amount of part time workers and marginally attached workers dropped in September, showing the sign that the job market thrives with not only more jobs, but jobs with better quality and brings more job security. It's needless to say that the job market is recovering with strength, and it craves qualified, well trained and discipline workers to fulfill highly technical positions. The STEM graduates are exactly the match to what is seeking after in the job market. The foreign students who study STEM are hard-working young men and women who appreciate their opportunity to receive the best STEM education in the world, and they devote their time to pursue the best GPAs for what they have invested for their education. The foreign STEM students are the most talented, self-driven and goal-oriented groups I have met and known in the US campuses. They're qualified through strict applicant selections by the school they applied -- we only want the most intelligent brains to join our colleges, that's for sure. We as a great nation have invited them to study the hardest, toughest problems, it's a big waste to let them go back to their home nations directly without giving them a chance to repay the country with what they've mastered over years of education -- we the people deserve to profit from our education investment on them.\n\nThe new ruling is not opening a window to job thieves, it does not deprive existing jobs and hand them to foreign graduates. The new STEM ruling will increase competition in the job market, we must face this consequence. But the American becomes great through free market and competition. Let the best win will not only encourage our own youth to invest more of their time in textbooks, but also broaden their minds that they're not just competing with their next block neighbors in their future position -- the globalism grantees the competition from all over the world, with all kinds of nations and people. The sooner our youth gets used to this fact, the better they are prepared to face the challenges from emerging countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Everybody loves easy job, but easy job is not for everybody, especially for those STEM-based positions. \n\nHowever, the STEM graduates are not threats to the job market, instead they're qualified supplements to the employers who can't fulfill their technique positions with US nationals or green card holders. The direct group of job seekers affected by the new rulings are the college graduates with a STEM-degree. Though this group of job seekers are among those with the lowest unemployment rate. The foreign STEM graduates are not competing with the majority of  the unemployed Americans, who are seeking almost entirely different category of job titles. In addition, to support a foreign national to work for the company, the employer has to spend thousands more to keep them work legally more than domestic workers. These foreign workers are not cheaper -- on the contrary, the company usually hire them as the last resort as they urgently seek qualified domestic employees yet unable to do so. H1B yearly cap also cast a further protection to domestic job seekers, as the limited amounts of H1B restrained how much foreigners could employers seek potentially. Therefore, keeping these foreign STEM graduates will not endanger most of our jobs. Some of us may feel less comfortable with our office chairs, but as a whole, our nation will benefit from what these young talents could bring to our economic and eventually, to each of our own family. \n\nIn conclusion, my support to the new STEM ruling is based on the fact that keep these foreign STEM trained talents won't hurt our recovering job market or those who are still seeking jobs. In a long term, this ruling will bring more fresh blood to the economic and keep our nation thrive, and most of all, be a better place for our children and grandchildren than it is today.

They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. At the same time, some startup US IT companies will loose large amount of experienced expertise staffs which cause great negative effect on their development.\n\n3. International students' participation into job market would increase the competition.

Such competition also makes US students works harder and harder, this will bring huge benefits to US society in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages.

A typical claim made by American citizens who are against this proposal is that by approving this proposal foreigners will take away lots of their jobs. This may seem true superficially but the claim is obviously flawed. On the one hand, most of the students having STEM degrees will look for the jobs that need more job applicants. On the other hand, employees of those positions tend to look for locals in the first place since there will be less communication as well as immigration status issues.\n\nMoreover, even assuming the employees are hiring more international students due to their higher proficiency, thus limiting the positions offered to locals. It is still not acceptable to reject this proposal. Limiting job opportunities for international students is just like forbidding foreign companies to enter the local market. It will definitely lead to lower competition, and therefore the development of the industries needing STEM students will be easily slowered and prohibited. Hence, it is crucial to establish fair competitions students. Local or international students, they will both make valuable contributions to the American society and thus bolster the competitiveness of America in the global stage.\n\nFinally, the US government should be open to skilled potential immigrants. As the biggest immigrant country in the world, the development American in recent centuries is made possible greatly by immigrants. As the world keeps growing indefinitely, the US government should never impose strict laws upon those who work hard wanting to live a better life in a better country. Different people bring different cultures and knowledges to the country. And the advanced American education system enables those people to gain future knowledge and make local contributions. If we take a look back on the American Nobel Price winners we will find many of them were in fact alien students who studied and then made great achievements in America. If the immigration laws were restricted at that time, the country would no doubt lose many talented people and the country may not be as powerful as it is today.\n\nThe proposal will apparently upset many American citizens, but it is never right to reject it for the good of the nation.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Wenlin Huang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-17443", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, many talented young people were forced to leave their country and take refuge in Syria.\nThrough Iraqi Student Project, my husband and I had occasion to assist many of them in their quest for advanced schooling\nin the United States.

This proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they will cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley stated that the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that \"ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\"\n\nI agree with Sam Rolley of Personal Liberty who said \"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.\"\n\nHe further states that \"a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.\"\n\"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\"\n\nThis program is another overreach to disadvantage our own citizens. I am against these new regulations unless the same opportunities are available for our own citizens and I would call for a moratorium on this program until there is an accounting for all the foreign students currently/formerly in this program.

Tech company are still hiring every year, native candidates and international candidates are sharing the same opportunity, I don't see any problem extending OPT STEM Extension rule. \n\nThirdly, some people are saying that international students have negative influences on the life of native America people. This is totally wrong. The increasing of international students will bring a lot of job opportunities to native American people. Let's assume 30% of a university students are international.

In order to keep these great minds in the country, thus continuing to bolster the United States' economic and technological dominance around the world, we as a nation have to be willing to incentivize their stay for a short duration after graduation so that they may find a productive workplace. It would potentially be a waste of millions of dollars annually to train the best workers for other nations, since a hostile or jobless work environment will push the brightest minds back to their country of origin much more rapidly.\n\nSecondly, the diverse American workplace can only enhance the reputation of the United States worldwide. When brilliant minds from all continents flock to one place for the betterment of humanity, America ought to hope that it is the destination. Indeed, multicultural and multinational cooperation starts at a local level, when you win the minds of students and young workers. \n\nAn so, I urge all concerned agencies to carefully consider the consequences mentioned in this comment before reaching a decision on the OPT-extension program.

However, I heard so many voice against it and most of them are for \" no reason\". So I think it is critical to discuss why this rule is necessary and we need to support this rule.\n\n\nFirst of all, this rule will benefit American people more than the F1 STEM students themselves. Based on the rule, it only applies to F1 STEM students who are most likely to work at technical position that require extremely advanced science knowledge. Given the limit number of STEM students (approximate 200,000 every year) and  great demand of talent people in American Tech companies to push the development move forward, these STEM students are not competing jobs with the local Americans. But in the other side, the technical companies that support by these STEM students make billions of dollars every year and they pay billions of tax to the government which will finally used to improve welfare of American people who  most likely aren't  taking those hard technical jobs and  contributing the advancement of American science. As a result of the hard work of the STEM students, American or even the whole world is becoming more and more intelligent and the welfare of America people is keep improving yearly. But what the STEM students get is just two more year experience in Silicon Valley or somewhere else. \n  \nThen, most of the people against this rule have no idea how significant it means to America and what they are doing. I happened to know some American who strongly against this rule and I asked them why. They relied back crucially \"I just don't want more immigrants in United States. They are taking all of our jobs and benefit from our welfare system.\"  So apparently, they have not really investigated what is behind this rule and if what they are claiming is true or not. Based on the discussion above, there are limited STEM students and the jobs they are working for are in short supply. And the comment that claiming STEM students will be new immigrants in America is even more ridiculous. The rule is just for Optional Practical Training which has nothing to do with immigration. Any rule should be loyal to the rule itself and should not be tool of other unjust purposes. If they want to prevent new immigrants into US, then they should address their problem in other immigration law rather than deprive the training opportunities of STEM students.\n\nLast but not least, it will be a great drawback to American economy if this rule fails to pass. Many people just cannot foresee what may happen util they see it. If the all the talent students are force to go home as soon as they graduate from school, the highly intelligence-required jobs will be soon in shortage of capable people. And as a result, more and more incapable or even not science related people will take those jobs and the development will be dead in water inevitably.  A two year long training for STEM students will keep those technical companies rotating smoothly and grow steadily, and will also benefit every local American people. Such a wise rule should  be passed rather than being killed. \n\nThe F1 STEM students are just a small group of international students who happen to have great impact on the development of American society. They are making contribution as any other native American. Therefore, I honestly think they should be treat fairly and their great contribution to the America society and human science should be appreciated and rewarded.\n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Hongzhi Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15141", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "First time I heard that the OPT extension for STEM have been cancel, I felt very upset. Thanks to all the people who made efforts the OPT extension, it is finally coming back.\nYes, I'm an international student who is benefited by this rule. But I believe international students are not the only group who get benefits. When I prepared to pursue a further education at US, I prepared over three years (much more than that if considering the language learning and information collecting). I spent at least three hours everyday for 9 months, no matter holidays or weekends, preparing for the exams like TOEFL and GRE. At the same time, I had to make efforts on my graduate study as well. Also, the tuition fees, application fees, exam fees are six times expensive for me according to the exchange rate. The question is, why did I paid so much time and money? Because the cutting-edge knowledge ,the most passionate students and the attractive opportunities make it worth the price. The OPT with a potential length of 29 months in total, which means we can get not only the academic training but also hands-on experience, is one of the most amazed thing attracting lots of hardworking students from all over the world. I can image that thousands of students will reconsider the their choice if it turns out there is no OPT extension any more. As the most important part of a university, the lose of the students, especially the passionate and hardworking students, will significantly affect the level of the school.\nEnterprises are another group that will get benefits. We all know how hard it is to find a job for a recent graduate student. The expends for the sponsorship and some security concerns make the situation worse for the international students. So that a student who can get the chance to reach the OPT extension must be excellent on his/her job. Getting an excellent employer will no doubt helps the enterprises. \nBesides, the growing of the education institutions and enterprises can bring the energy to the society and stimulate the economy.

Large amount of labor devoted in technologies which in turn benefit everyone's daily life. Taken all labor in tech with H1B visa and OPT is like pumping too much blood from a healthily developing body, the rest will hardly remain functional. This never mean that the international STEM students are better in their major than others, but the fact is that the gap is huge and it is impossible to fill with the resident's STEM population.\n\n2. Some may argue that the best working opportunities in tech companies were taken from U.S. citizens by those students with OPT extension, and a longer OPT extension will only make it worse. They just can't imagine how difficult it is for an international student to find a job in United States even with OPT extension. First of all, employers, especially the popular ones, like to see relevant work experience on the resume. As an international student, intern as much as you can is impossible. They can't just take less courses while working at the same time because maintaining full-time enrollment until the last semester is mandatory and working while studying is highly restricted. Second, please don't be shamed to admit the fact that residents have too many nature advantages over foreigners and this is so true in any other country as well. These opportunities were taken, by excessive hard working and unfair restrictions, but not easily.\n\n3. This is an extension for OPT, which means population with H1B visa and international student will not be affected (at least not directly), and students fail to obtain H1B still have to leave U.S. after the OPT expires.

OPT Extension (24-month) along with 12-month OPT will help international STEM students significantly because all academic, private or public organizations/companies require both academic knowledge and practical experience. OPT extension will help to grow American economy as well.\n\nI would like to describe my personal circumstance. I have completed my first Master's in Agricultural Engineering from a U.S. research university. In that degree, I took few GIS (Geographic Information System) courses to implement GIS knowledge in Agricultural Engineering. Then I have completed my second Master's in Geography at the same university and worked in a NASA funded project as a graduate research assistant. Later, I recognized GIS major is defined as STEM (CIP code 45.0702 (Geographic Information Science and Cartography)) but Geography is not (CIP code 45.0701 (Geography)). However, most of the graduate level coursework and research of GIS (Geographic Information System) in the U.S. universities are offered in Geography departments. Additionally, offering PhD in GIS (CIP code 45.0702) is very rare in U.S. universities. Therefore, geography should be included as a STEM major.\n\nNow, I am in OPT and gaining experience in GIS related area and would like to acquire 3 years (12 months OPT + 24 months OPT extension) practical experience and then I would like to go for my PhD in geography and would like to acquire practical experience again. Therefore, STEM OPT extension is crucial for me. If geography is not included as STEM, international students like me need to go another country for PhD in geography where we can complete PhD and achieve practical experience (e.g., 36 months) in this field. I also published a paper in a peer reviewed journal why geography should be included as STEM (doi:10.5539/jgg.v7n1p27): http://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jgg/article/view/43858/24468. I urge DHS to include geography (CIP code 45.0701) in STEM list so that we can pursue our PhD in geography from a U.S. university. Please feel free to contact with me if you need additional information.\n\nAlso, please make \"exit and re-entry\" easy for international students in OPT period. Initial OPT was 12 months and travelling outside of U.S. was no urgent issue for that period. However, now students need to travel home and come back in 36-month period (OPT 12 month and STEM extension 24 month).

There is a huge demanding for the high level graduate students from these majors, however, just take a quick glance at the compositions in courses such as computer science, electronic engineering, etc., it is obvious that quite few students are really US citizens. Take my class for example, there are 59 master students majoring at Computer Science in my school, however, only 2 of them are owning the US Citizenship. Can you really imagine that the companies can hire sufficient labor only from US citizens? Do a simple math, or even comparison between the figure of the students majoring at STEM and having US citizenship, and the figure that the employees the companies need, the answer is obvious. \n\nThere is an opinion that the companies can pay less to hire the foreign students. However, there is no evidence to support this at all. The real reason that the companies are willing to hire more STEM studens is simply because the companies have no many choices. As well known, the salaries for the computer science major students are even higher for the STEM students than those US Citizens. Usually, the US citizens are not quite willing to take these difficult majors. Also take my company for example, it is an American company, however, there is no US citizen in my company, simply because we could not find any US citizens with such skills. \n\nWell, another reason, all people around world understand the essence of US--Freedom, and refuse to this propose is so ridiculous to happen in the US. Even though, I bet that every one has to admit that the most important factor for a coutry to develop is technology, which is developed by well educated people. Just imagine that the STEM students failed to work in the USA, what would they do? Almost for sure, they will go back to their own country, such as China, India, Korean, etc., and work for their local companies. Then, will this be a great deal for the USA? Do you want to have another version of FACEBOOK and GOOGLE developed by the STEM stduents in China or India? At least, these huge companies, FACEBOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER, AMAZON, etc. who hired, are hiring and will hire more and more STEM students, can make a huge amount of taxes and other contribution to the world, as well as the American Culture. Beyond this, more and more talented and skilled persons will be scary to move to the USA, since they would think that the USA government does not cherish knowledge and skill at all. \n\nIt is also very short-sight to decline this proposal, just to have more jobs available for US citiznes. The taxes and revenue created by these companies can in turn create more and more jobs for all people, including US citiznes. \n\nBesides above, there are many other reasons that I don't have time and space to express here.\n\nI really appreciate that the government would take my opinions into consideration. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Terrace Gelmich", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14962", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "  I strongly support OPT extension for the following reasons:\n\n  Some opponents argue that it will be more difficult for U.S. citizens to find a job.

This problem is particularly acute in the information technology sector.  My son in law received training in this field and was near the top of his class, however he has not been able to find employment in this field since completing his training some seven years ago.\n\nThe son of a close friend graduated from Texas A&M four years ago near the top of his class with a degree in information technology and he has been unable to find an entry level full time position in his chosen field.  He spends his time as an underemployed IT consultant setting up systems for small company's on a part time basis.\n\nBoth of the individuals I have given as my examples are struggling, due in part to our government's inexplicable policy of importing citizens of other countries rather than attempting to employ our own work force.\n\nI think our government should insure that all of our students who are citizens are gainfully employed before we attempt to implement a policy like the one proposed.  And lastly, I would like to point out that major policy changes like the proposed regulations should be passed as a law by the congress, and not an expansion or convoluted interpretation of existing regulations.\n\nThank you for considering my comments.\n\n\nAlbert Crain", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Albert Crain", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3201", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "support STEM extention.

I was a Master student (international) and now a PhD student in a top-ten engineering school. My Master project is only one and a half year, during which I am crazily busy with all different courses and hardly think about the future. It is my 4-month internship (during my OPT time) that makes me realize I really love engineering, love my field, and wish to do more research on it. \n\nAlso, I'd like to mention, INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE STUDENTS who are studying in US continually CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING of the United States and the whole world. They are part of US's engineering system. Take myself as an example:  For my internship, there were approximately 200 interns including around 10 international students in my company. However, I found out that the seven interns belong to my department - research and develop center, were all international students with Master or PhD degrees. This also happens to my school: approximately 50% PhD students in the department are international (what's more, there might be another 25% that are sons and daughters of immigrants). More specifically, in my research group (maybe also happen in some other specific research fields) , all people are international, even the professor. Imagine all of these people are forced to leave US simultaneously because of the policy. \n\nThese talented students are doing research/engineering work that few people could replace. US has spent lots of money/time educating them to be seasoned researchers/scientists. If there is no enough OPT time, and they are forced to leave US, leave the valuable work they really love, it would be a loss for not only these international students, but also the United States. \n\nI am really shocked when I saw so many comments written as \"international students eat up US citizen's working opportunities by accepting lower wage just to stay here, etc\". I earned and will earn a wage far above the minimum wage line; I am solving high technique problems that few people can deal with; I was, am and will continue to be an excellent researcher/engineer contributing to US every minute I stay here.

At that time, the application of deep learning to computer vision was still an emerging field of study, recruiting some qualified interns was a really hard job. But luckily, we did it.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated (or will graduate) in 2017 with a master's degree in the field of Computer Science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2018, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nJaithrik Yadav Bollaboina", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jaithrik Yadav Bollaboina", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21824", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The STEM opt extension is an very important way to attract brilliant mind from overseas to study at US.

We can easily imagine using statistics to improve health care services, or using computer technology to facilitate children's academic achievement. To accomplish such goals, we need experts who have knowledge not only in statistics or programming, but also in non-STEM areas like health care or education. However, under the previous OPT extension policy, international students who have already obtained STEM degrees would only have a very limited period of OPT if they want to pursue a second degree in non-STEM areas and work in such STEM-related but interdisciplinary fields. If they are allowed to use the previously obtained STEM degree for their OPT extension, it would be great support to their career development. \n\n\nIn addition, such a new policy would encourage international STEM students to apply their STEM knowledge to various fields in our life, rather than to stick with the very traditional STEM fields. Therefore, the traditional STEM fields will not be overcrowded with foreigners, and the interdisciplinary fields can advance with more STEM experts. Since the new policy requires the job to be related with the previously obtained STEM degree, these students will not take up employment opportunity of US-citizens in STEM-unrelated areas. The policy will be beneficial to the international students, the US economy, and the life quality/employment opportunity of the US-citizens.\n\n\n2) Deciding whether a student really majors in STEM is sometimes more difficult and complex than just looking at their I-20. The same type of program may be assigned with different CIP codes in different schools, sometimes STEM and sometimes non-STEM. For example, in developmental psychology programs (which is a STEM area), students in some schools are listed on their I-20 as majoring in STEM fields of \"child/developmental psychology\" or \"experimental psychology\", and thus considered as STEM students; however, students in other schools may have \"general psychology\", \"education\", or \"human development\" on their I-20, therefore unable to apply for the OPT extension. But in reality, these developmental psychology programs coded as non-STEM do not differ at all from those coded as STEM-related in their coursework and research. The difference in the codes is not due to the nature of the program, but a result of school bureaucracy. Therefore, dividing developmental psychology students into STEM and non-STEM and deciding their eligibility for OPT extension simply based on their most recent degree would be unfair and ignorant of the complexity in reality. Such problems do not only occur in psychology, but also in other disciplines. While it is difficult to change the STEM major categories, with the new policy, students who continuously obtained two or more degrees in the same discipline will be considered as STEM students if one of the programs are coded as STEM. This new policy will improve employment equality of students within the same discipline. \n\n\nAlternatively, to ensure employment equality, DHS should allow students who are categorized as non-STEM majors to apply for the STEM OPT extension if the students can prove that their coursework and thesis/dissertation topic can fulfill the requirements of another program that is coded as STEM.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Danming An", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-2637", "postedDate": "2015-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly SUPPORT the 24 months OPT extension for the following reasons:\n1, Having a relatively long OPT period is one of the reasons America has been attracting international students from everywhere to come here for school.

This will also hugely benefit the U.S. economy as high-skilled workers will be hired only by the most honest and worthy employers due to the mentoring and reporting requirements.\n\nIf this rule is not passed, it will affect me very adversely.

This may result in a meltdown of the software industry and can cause a economic catastrophy. Also, to make things worse - knowing that the U.S. is not supportive of practical training opportunities for international students will reduce the number of applications to American universities. This may cause a significant drop in revenues of schools from the heavy international student fees. A lot of incoming international students may also move to other countries offering attractive benefits and hassle free visa processing for talented students. The image of United States as a great destination to learn, grow, research and cherish knowledge will be maligned forever in the eyes of several international students, scholars and teachers for generations to come.\n\nAn alternative DHS should consider is - implementing the STEM OPT as is - with a 17 month extension period after the initial OPT period. This would at least not shoo away all the international students from USA.\n\nI truly and completely believe the United States loves and accepts people of all origin, nationalities, ethnicities, economic strata and visa statuses and will allow me to gain professional experience after my Masters.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Chetan Nagarkar", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22276", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I firmly believe that this proposal is good for the students as it gives them top notch training at some of the best technology companies of the world, as US is the technology leader of the world.

OPT is meant for providing international students with opportunities in gaining working experiences. For STEM degree holders, especially those who with more advanced degrees (Ph.D & M.S), 12 month is not enough. Everyone knows how competent it is now to find a job/internship. International students may spend as much as 3 months in finding an internship, the next 3 months in settling down and getting familiar with the working environments, the next 3 months in starting easy and small tasks. If OPT is only 12-monthly long, the remaining 3 month would be the time for getting ready to leave. Then students who worked so hard to get an advanced degree cannot even start to use their talent before they are forced leave. International students can contribute a lot more to the United States. Why not extending the OPT period a bit more and maximizing the brain power that students can bring? \n\n2. International students are NOT taking away any working opportunities. First of all, all US companies prefer US citizens, which means international students are already losing a lot at the very first begin. People who have no experience cannot imagine how hard it is for international students to find an internship even if they are more than capable of doing the job. Secondly, because companies prefer US citizens, the international students they hired must be their only better choice. If a US student and an international student have similar working experience, the same expertise, and are equally competent, 99% of the companies would choose the US student. Companies are not charities, they only hire who can contribute and can benefit the whole organization. \n\nAs Thomas Jefferson pointed out in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal. Then why cannot international students be treated a more equally way? If international students are less competent than US citizens and cannot find a job, they would not argue about anything. However, if they are offered a job opportunity, it means they can contribute and make a difference. It would be unfair for them to leave a position just because they are not US citizens. \n\nAs a summary, I am for the proposal of extending OPT for STEM degree students who are capable, hard-working, and has already started to make a difference in every fields in the States.

Among all the talents, STEM students play a significant role in the system. It is undoubtedly true that most of scientists, engineers and mathematicians are immigrants from outside US. A chance to STEM students means a chance to US's future.\n\n2) Losing talents are critical threats to US\nThink about the case when most of international STEM students leave US for their own country. US universities spent tons of resources and funds to educate and train those brilliant minds just to make they work for other nations? There are numerous examples that those draining brains are creating strong competitors that challenges US's companies. Google was forced away by its competitor called Baidu Inc. in China whose CEO went back to China after graduation. Lenovo acquired former cellphone giant Motorola stealing talents from US.\n\n3) Giving Jobs for STEM students will benefit the job market.rather than harm it.\nJobs for STEM students require high level education background and advanced technologies. Unfortunately, there are way fewer US citizens qualified. Allowing STEM students to work won't make US people lose their own job but rather create more job opportunities. For example, O2O startups such as Uber and Airbnb hire many international employees to build amazing technology that allows US citizens to work part-time or full-time. Hundred and thousands of Americans are benefited and earn much more than before. In fact, STEM students are creating more opportunities than the opportunities they are given.\n\nIn sum, please improve the current policy for F1 students with STEM degrees and secure the talents at our best efforts.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.

DHS had a real opportunity to reform the OPT program to give a fair treatment to American workers with this rule, but the proposed rule falls short in several areas that I listed below -\n\n1. The biggest weakness of the OPT program has always been that its a subsidy for employers as they are exempt from FICA taxes, which can result in substantial savings for employers over long term. This makes them tacitly discriminate against American works. This rule does nothing to address this shortcoming. The rule should change to make the employers pay the FICA taxes when hiring OPT students\n\n2. The provisions to make sure employers paying the OPT workers same wage as American workers are quite weak. I have worked with OPT workers in my previous jobs. Most of these workers are under a lot of pressure to obtain H1b visas from their current employer. So, they work for any kind of wages as long as the employer is willing to sponsor them a H1b visa. The only way to enforce this is to modify the rule to make sure the employers submit a Labor condition application to certify that they are going to pay the OPT student the current prevailing wage.\n\n3. The duration for which the OPT student is allowed to work in most cases will be substantially longer than the time the F-1 student spends in school. Most of the F-1 students coming in STEM fields come to study Masters degrees in US universities, which in most cases take around 1 year to 1.5 year to complete. It does not make any sense to let these students do an internship for 3 years, given that most of them did a 1 year course. It would make a little more sense to give Phd grads 3 years of work permit, but for Masters grad its just a completely illogical thing to do. So, the rule should be modified to give the 3 years OPT only to Phd grads, or to Master's grads who study for more than 2 years\n\n4. The OPT rule's Mentoring and Training plan is a decent provision to make sure the student is sticking to his field of study. But again, how is this enforced? Does DHS have funds to do onsite audits of OPT program, given that DHS is not charging any additional fees for it on OPT application? Where is the money to do the audits coming from? \n\nThanks again for your time and consideration.

I have something to say about the OPT. \n1. The policy is really helping my company make progress in business. There are about 10 employees with OPT visa in my company. They are smart and reliable. Work distributed to them could be nicely done without any delay. This could help me focus on the management of the company and make good progress.  \n2. I don't think there is job competition between the foreign students and citizens. I personally want to hire citizens. There would be less paper work to do. But I could not find proper citizens with high level education and good at circuit design, even I could not receive resumes from citizens. Thanks to the OPT policy, not only it helps students earn working experience but it really give companies like mine wide resource to choose proper employees. \n3. 29 months are too short. It usually takes 1 year to finish one project in my company. After two projects finished, if without H1b visa, the students with OPT have to go back to their country. What a pity! With two years experience, they are hard cores and treasure of my company. Because of the 29 months time limitation, I have to give up them and re-hire new entry-level employees. I wouldn't say 12+24 months in the new policy is long enough, but it gives more changes(3 times H1B lottery chances) for me to save my treasure.  \nI strongly agree with the new OPT policy.

It's predictable that more and more international student will choose other countries, or not studying aboard at all. American economy will be affected. Native people who already got jobs because of these international students will lose their jobs. This probably will cause an instability of American society.\n\nOne of the reasons why United States has a leading position in Science and Technology is because it's attracting top students all over the world to study in America.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates because to both STEM international graduates and the country of United States of America, it is a win-win. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. Regarding this topic, technology companies are the major tax payers and the technology resource of United States which keep U.S. staying ahead of other competitors such as Russia and China.  \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months. In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nWith this letter, I strongly urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n \nSincerely,\nYunfei Wang\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yunfei Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22563", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think the rule will bring a win-win outcome for both US citizens and non-immigrants themselves.After the financial crisis in 2008, US is lack of economic momentum for many industries, especially for the high-tech industries, which require more and more high-tech labor resources to maintain its dominant role in the world in the face of the fierce competition from other rising countries.

Because foreign workers are better fitted and with better skills.... \nForeigners only take jobs that citizens don't want.. that is why there are so many people working with STEM, cause most US citizen doesn't like the boring science or engineering jobs... \nThe low employment rate is not caused by hardworking citizens with specified skills, it is because those who don't have any skills and their jobs are being replaced by machines or technologies, NOT FOREIGN STEM students!! For example, an computer engineer or scientist is easier to find another job if they get laid off. However, a cashier or people working at front desk is less likely, because their work is no longer needed by the current society. Who will hire one more bank front desk if all the transactions, or check deposit can be completed by cellphone? Bank branches are closing not because foreigners are taking the jobs, it is because the society doesn't need so many branches as before. \n\n3. For those who said people have student loans and cannot find a job... \nI have to admit that tuition is ridiculously high... \nHowever, if you chose comedy as your major in ivy league and with student loan, you need to consider that your are way more less likely to find a well paid job comparing with STEM, and more less likely to pay back your loans. \nAlso, a lot of foreign students pay their tuition by their parents. Why their parents can afford the fees? Because they have better finical plan than US parents. They save money every month, learn to make investment. And the money they saved or earned for years all go to USA. Can't you say this is a method for US gaining huge amount of money over the world???\n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous (X.C.)", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5436", "postedDate": "2015-11-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Dear Ms.Westerlund:\n\nI would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICS's Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.\n\nI am glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. The OPT STEM extension should be retained for the benefit of STEM graduates.\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nAs for the mentoring plan, I think it would make sense for students who apply for the initial OPT. Students like us who are applying OPT STEM extension having spent 12 months already; the mentoring plan might not make more sense. \n\nMost people think that the International students take away the STEM jobs. In reality, especially in Actuarial Science and other fields except Computer Science, it is very difficult to find a job since most firms are not inclined to sponsor us for H1B visa and so they do not consider us. And with an unemployment period of 90-120 days, it makes it even more difficult, mentally, to find a job to stay back in the US. We spend so much of money in Tuition fees, rent, living expenses, shopping, travel and on many more things bringing plenty of business to the US economy. Also, when the government is making illegals to live in the US legally, why should students who spend so much time and money, prepare for entrance exams (GMAT/GRE, IELTS/TOEFL) and come to the US legally, be sent back to their country?\n\nWith this comment, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

As far as I know, lots of companies in IT are still lack of high-class and talented labors, which cannot be sufficiently filled with the US citizens. The situation is much worse in the research institutes of IT companies especially. Furthermore, the proposed policy will attract more and more talented people to the America and lower the cost of explicitly inducing high-class labors from abroad. In other words, the policy is not to shrink the job opportunities for the potential citizens, but to fill the gaps of some specific areas. \n\nAs well as stimulating the development of high tech in the US, the proposed policy will also increase the competitive capability of the US from the perspective of attracting the talented or the high-class labor stay in the US and contribution to the US rather than letting them go back to help our opponents. Since we have already provided high quality education to the F1 students, including students from China, India, etc., we should also reap the benefits from their contribution to the relevant companies and in turn the states. In addition, as we know, the consumption capability of the current F1 students from China or India rises dramatically alongside the growth of their countries' economic boost. This will also stimulate our market and create more job openings for the citizens. Therefore, improving and expanding OPT for STEM F-1 students is still an indispensable policy in the foreseeable future.

International students have been a very important group of American education system as they are contributing diversity, academic achievemnt to the country from technology development perspective, and since the number of international students is huge, the economic growth of the country also benefit from their huge amount of consumptions.\n\nSecond, the technology development would benefit from having more skilled, educated technicians. Let's take Silicon Valley, CA as an example: about 36% of the employees working for the technology companies are foreign born and the majority of the 36% employees are international students who are working on their OPT. Imagine that if the OPT extension rule was revoked, these international employees would be forced back home and that would bring a great loss for the companies. Many of the important ongoing projects could even be forced to stop forever. And that would definitely bring a negative impact on the technology and economic development for California and even the country (think about how important the Silicon Valley is in terms of technology and economic growth).\n\nThird, some people may hold the opinion that STEM graduates could work on the one-year OPT after graduation. But the fact is new hires will need at least 6 to 8-month training before they could get to know the work process of the company and make contributions. If they will have to leave right after they are ready to work more efficiently and effectively, companies would not even hire them at the beginning. The 24-month extension would definitely solve this problem, and it provides an excellent opportunity for both the employees to get more familar with the work and the employer to know more about the employee, it gives the employers more time to evauate the employee in order to make decisions on whether sponsoring the employee or not. Thus, this action will largely decrease the risk for both sides of employment.\n\nLast, because of the cap of the H1-B work visa, there are thousands of thousands of newly hired international employees competing for the limited positions (that's why it is called a lottery). Under this circumstances, strange phenomenons are appearing like companies specilizing in helping their employees particiting in this lottery even the employees are currently not in U.S.. And all these, as I think, are because the authorized work period after graduation was too short, if the OPT were extended, then DHS, USCIS, job market as a whole would have much less pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, extending the OPT would benefit all that were involved in this issue (the country and its economic and techology development, immigration department, job markets, students theirselves, etc.). So I strongly support this proposal.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Alex Lin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18620", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I adamantly oppose the new OPT rule.\n\nThis expanded OPT program is designed to hurt Americans:\n\n     *allows most participants to pay NO money into Social Security or Medicare; \n     \n     *takes hundreds of thousands of American jobs and hands them to foreigners;\n\n     *fails to require employers to pay the prevailing wage.\n\nUnder this program, over half a million ADDITIONAL foreign students would qualify for this scam program, bringing the total to 700,000 foreign workers taking American jobs. \n\nThese foreign workers and their employers will NOT PAY any social security payroll taxes. \n\nThis has already shortchanged the Social Security fund over 1 Billion dollars in 1 year.

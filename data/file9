Cutting this rule off will cause immediate, inevitable harm to the companies, thus, significantly and adversely impact the economy, causing unimaginable after-shocks to every field in the US. \nSecond, tuition fees from international students is a major portion of finance support for universities, especially public ones.

Cutting OPT would inevitably cause  significant decrease of international students.

The global competitiveness of US relies on its ability to attract excellent researchers, engineers from all over the world. A major portion of these people are actually students who continue to stay in the US after graduation. These people need OPT. The competition among countries and organizations (US, China, EU, Japan, etc.) largely rely on these people.

With strong people, US can obviously develop better, and continue to be the leader in STEM throughout the world. And, there are ENOUGH POSITIONS FOR EVERYONE to find a job in STEM. Therefore, there's no reason to prevent international student from working in US.\n\nSecond, the main reason from people who disagree with this expanding is they want to protect the profit of US citizen. As we all know, the most important reason why united state can be the strongest county in the world is they KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ABSORB GREATEST PEOPLE throughout the world. This is why US becomes what it is like today. It is fair and necessary to have some US citizen unemployed because of their own weakness or laziness. Therefore, there is no reason to stop this expanding, if US still want to be the best in the world.\n\nThird, if we cancel this expanding, all the potential greatest scientists will have to go back to their hometown, and support their local company or government to compete with US.

When something like 50% of our citizens who graduate with science and technological degrees can not find jobs in their field, it is inappropriate, treacherous, and in fact, I would suggest treasonous of a government agency to also use taxpayer money to subsidize alien workers in those roles. When you allow F-1 visa holders to remain in USA after graduation and work, they are taking Americans jobs. On top of that you are subsidizing their employers, by the fact that the employer need not pay payroll taxes for these workers. \n\nBelow are some facts that upset me:\n\tOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n\tOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\tThe original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\tThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\tOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\tOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\n\tSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\tIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n\tIf workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n\tOPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\nDavid North (formerly of the US Labor Department) States the following:\n\t\"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\t\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\t\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\t\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\nThis program clearly favors foreign or alien persons over Americans and is inappropriate for Homeland Security to allow.\n\nDr. Gary Mitchell\n2977 Hickory Nut Lane\nKalamazoo, MI 49004\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Gary Mitchell", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-3315", "postedDate": "2015-10-30T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I'm from Boston and won't forget how one of these jerks blew up our marathon.

Many US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which, in turn, bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for US. On the other way, for STEM students, this is a good chance to apply what they learned and gain more industry experience.\n\nMany negative comment focus on two points: 1.they are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries. 2. They think international students should be responsible for minimum wage.\n\nFor the first point, I don't think it makes sense. The simple but most directly evidence is the voice from the high-tech company. I have to say US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability, simply because they can work without any restrictions while international students need sponsor from those tech companies. What's more, there is also risking potential loss of international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles? International students is more talent than US students? Definitely not. It was just because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that makes tech companies need international student to work for them. \n\nAs to the second point, International STEM students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage, simply because STEM students will work in high-tech industry, which also means highly paid. In fact, an international STEM student needs about 2-4 times the salary of the minimum pay, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on more competitive positions like software/hardware engineer.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qingran Zheng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18495", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am an international student who will benefit from this policy. The United States also gains a lot from it. This is not a zero-sum game, but a chance to benefit both sides.

When I am plaining to start my master program, I have several choices: Japan, England, Denmark, Australia, China, and America. The reason I chose the U.S. is because the original OPT which enable me to gain near 2 years working experience before I back to my homeland. This experience can strengthen my competitiveness. Most international STEM students came to U.S. because of it. And no doubt the new policy can attract more talents to study in this country.\n\nSecond, many us companies trying to build their own business in other countries. This requires their employers have both marketing experience in the other country and experience on how American company works. Residents in America can gain such experiences from international students, and international students can gain such experiences from U.S. companies. This will create more working opportunities for both sides along with the expanding of U.S. companies into the new market. \n\nThird, we pay for tuition and afford living expenses in order to learn new stuffs in the U.S.. This means that we bring money from our hometown and create working opportunities for residents in America. For example, I  am now in Los Angeles. Every semester, large mount of international students need to rent house. So there are many company such as CDI Management, G.H. Palmer Associates provide service to us. If U.S.A. cancel OPT, it will dramatically reduce the international student number. Which will cause 2 issues: 1) it reduces the working opportunity for residents. 2) it may cause the failure of existing company and many employees lose their jobs.\n\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Junpeng Xiao", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9913", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "This rule enables students who received education in United States to enrich their experience in the field of their education present here which may not be available in their home country.

However, the companies, such as Apple, Google, Amazon and so on, hired students who mainly majored in STEM. These companies have important roles in America's Economy. If this proposal is not approved, the majority of international students must go back to their own countries. That means these companies would not hire enough students to help them because most Americans are majored in Medicine, Law and Film. Then these companies will become weaker and weaker. Therefore, this phenomenon will affect America's Economy seriously. \n\nSecondly, this proposal will benefit both international students and United States. This proposal will give international students three years to work in and contribute to America, which means each international student will have three opportunities to get H1B visa. This will benefit international student a lot. Besides, if more and more international students get H1B visa, they will contribute to America a lot and therefore, United States will become stronger and stronger and will be a leader in technique filed around the world. \n\nFinally, this proposal will attract more and more international students come to United States and this will be a huge amount of income. Besides, this proposal will keep United States at the top position in education around in the world. Many students want to have industry experience after they graduation. The OPT is one of the main reasons which attract international students come to America. Recently, many other countries, such as Canada, United Kingdom and Austria, are considering to propose training program similar to OPT in order to attract international students. Therefore, in this competitive world, United States should open mind and take this good proposal.\n\nIn sum, I strongly support this proposal and this proposal will benefit both international students and America.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by martin bear", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12664", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I am definitely support, and I need bring something up to supplement my first comment.\n\n(1) I called my Landlord which is a police Officer in Jersey City, and he entirely welcome more student to live here. 5-6 years before, Before his living are become a students living area of SIT, his houses that permanently bring to to rent were empty for their half time. But now his houses are always full, because more international students which are able to pay expensive tuition and rent come to US for studying living in this distinct. Moreover he told me these students never delay to pay the rent. Unite States have already promised STEM students to have at least 19 month OPT extension, that's one reason that why they are glad to come here to pay expensive tuition to study and potentiality gain working experience instead of going to other country like UK, Australia or Canada. At least keep the word that DHS has promised to them will attract more student come to US to spend more money here otherwise reputation of US's higher education system would be diminished and Citizens of US won't get more benefit from it.\n\n(2) I am working in a Startup- mid-level IT field company in NYC which has more than 100 employees. For the last several year, it only hire US citizen or permanent people. However it quickly found out not like some position like sales, customer representative, it is really hard to hire qualified candidate of software position just from permanent people. So after a discussion, founders of my company decided to break the limit, even they knew compare to hire a permanent person, hiring a OPT employee will bring more complicated documents to be done, more forms to be filled, and also applied E-verify to attract more talents candidates.

Without hiring this people, they couldn't get enough people to work for them to make companies to be more functional.

In  career fair, less 10 percent of companies accept the application from visa holder, and they still consider American citizens first. It makes sense, but if America wants to stay robust, it must provide opportunities for those elites who are willing to make contribution to the development of America. STEM degrees need real efforts and intelligence. We can't deny the fact that students from China,India or some other foreign counties are better in many of STEM majors. \n\nOPT is extremely critical to F-1 students. They need time to be familiar with the competitions and find a job that they truly love. Also they need to draw for the work visa which is such a inequitable policy. Longer OPT means that they can have one or two extra chance to draw, so that real elites can keep working in America, and it decrease the degree of injustice.\n\nOh, one last thing is that immigrants are not threats unless you are really weak. Most of the immigrants are hard working and well behaved. You hate those nice immigrants because you are a coward. You are afraid of the potential that they take your position.

I will share my story. I am an international student in Aerospace sector and I did my post graduation at MIT, and it is impossible for an international to work with leading Aerospace firms. So I completely DISAGREE that we are taking away American jobs. Once I had to get out from the middle of an interview at Boeing after they realized that I am an international even though I had all the required qualification. But I wanted to work in core Aerospace sector, so I went to Europe and worked for Boeing's rival - Airbus. \n\nHere are my two cents for why the OPT extension is justified:\n1. At least in my vast network of American friends who are well-educated and qualified, I don't know even a single person who has to sit at home. The bottom line is if you have the requisite skills, then both Americans and internationals have same opportunities.\n2. America is a land of immigrants. It just doesn't make sense for America to train young smart kids and then loose them to another country, and then hire some less qualified American.\n3. History is full of examples that so many US companies were started by non-Americans employing lots of Americans. What if they were not given the visas?\n4. I feel that lot of frustration among Americans against OPT is because of mis-information or news items like \"How Indian workers replaced 250 workers at Disney\". I have to agree, that if any company is trying to hire cheaper contract workers to cut down on costs by laying off Americans, then that is totally unethical and any relevant and any relevant legal action should be considered against such malpractices.

The GOV should make more modification to H1B rule not only STEM OPT. I was an international STEM student, but I want to say something helpful for this country not only for our international students. I have seen a lot of Non-STEM graduate students from business school working for insurance companies who will pay for them 9 -15 dollar per hour for internship. If they perform well, they will be promoted to a full-time position earning from 40K+ to 50K+ annually. I guess most people of American can even make almost same amount of money. So why do you need them to stay in this country? I saw one of my friends luckily won the H1B lottery by earning 40K+ from State farm, then she can stay in America. But one of my colleague who can make more than 100K per year has to force to leave this country, because he didn't win the H1B twice. I don't mean business students who can't make a lot of money are less important than our STEM students. Of course, there are still a lot of business students out there can earn more money than us. But the most important thing is that U.S. needs to select the most talented foreigners by measuring how much contribution they can make for this country. GOV should make the H1B rules better to select most valuable foreign workers not randomly select them like our current H1B lottery system. It is not reasonable to ask the best talents in the world to go back to their own countries. \n\n\nAlso I think some previous comments also mentioned ICC(India Consulting Company). GOV needs to put more investigation on how a lot of ICC are sending fake resumes to American companies. I can say all of the American companies who want to save more budget by hiring contractors are hiring contractors from these ICC. Almost over 2000 ICC in New York are target on new gradate international students which is the biggest new employee resource for them beside India. And their attraction are sponsoring them H1B and Green Card and offering them free training for several weeks which are about to teach them how to answer correctly in the interviews. They don't care about your background, they are also recruiting a lot of NON-STEM students who got business degrees. After that they will send out fake resumes by modifying these new graduate international student who are just around 25 years old to have 8 - 10 years work experience on the resume. But in return they need them to sign the contracts to work with them for one year. That's a way for some of new graduate international students to apply for H1B who can not find a job by themselves. Because H1B application only cost $3000-$5000 per each person. But they can earn 100k - 200k from companies by paying them only 60K in average for each student.\n\n\nBy the way, I think GOV can increase H1B quota by decreasing political asylum green card quota. I think it is not a news any more that a lot of \"Chinese refugees\" are applying asylum green card by saying they are \"Christian\" and they are suffer \"political persecution\". Also some guys from Chinese Churches will help them to prepare some fake Christ documents and wrap them up. Almost over 65% these applicants can be approved successfully. These cheaters use up a lot of US political asylum green cards every year. But I can say 100% of them are fake Christian. They didn't suffer any persecution in China. I know there is no persecution to most religions including Christian, Buddhism, Islam in China. They were all living in the bottom of society in China. They came here because they can make more money in American than in China and awesome benefit for permanent residents. Over 90% of them are not well educated in China, ironically some of them don't even know how to write Chinese. Because they can't even speak English,  all of them are working in restaurants and foot SPA etc, Also they are making money by cash, so they won't declare a real number on tax return. They will give a very low number on form W2 or 1099 like 20k - 30k per family to meet the requirement of Medicaid. Actually they can earn 80K per family at least. How could you believe any family can survive in New York and California by making no more than 30K+ per year? You can see a lot of them in Flushing NY, L.A. and S.F.. What's more their children don't need to pay for any tuition in the college, they can even earn several thousands dollar back from school because of their \"low income\" situation. Come on!!! we are paying a lot of tax to the GOV every year, but they are using our money to give tons of green cards to fake Christian asylum and provide them free education and medical aid. Why not give these opportunities to some talent foreigners who can contribute a lot to this country? We High-Tech foreigners needs to work very hard to get greed cards over 5- 10 years. They can get green cards in 1- 3 years who didn't have any good education, and eating up our public education and medical resources.\n ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14952", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this rule for sure!

So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents.

To start with, everyone should know that the IT industry accounts for a major percentage of US economic growth and the reason why many IT firms are offering positions to international students is because there are not enough US citizens studying STEM majors. That was the reason why DHS was offering the extension back in 2008 until it got refuted within the last couple of months. If this extension does not get passed it will result in a huge loss of IT talents and a shortage of IT professionals for the US economy which will be detrimental for US citizens. Besides, the OPT extension will act as an incentive for international students to come to study in US as they figure a possible extra two years experience in US will help their career development after they go back to their respective countries. We all know the fact is that only a minority of international students get to stay in the US right after graduation, as a vast majority go back after they graduate. But if we do not offer the OPT extension they might choose not to come and that will be a huge loss of US economy as they pay higher tuition than US citizens or green card holders along with their daily spending which stimulate the economy. And we have all witnessed how large the international student communities are in major US colleges. So from an economic point of view, the STEM OPT extension will greatly help the US economy.

Otherwise, the petition only benefits for a very small group of us. I and my friends chose the U.S to study and have paid hundreds thousand dollar for the U.S government because we believe we are and will be given the same opportunities from the country(I say opportunities, not rights), but now it seems that the U.S government is considering to take away what brought us here from the beginning. Please reconsider the consequences to your economy as the U.S may be no longer a \"number one in list country\" which intl students will choose. \n\nFor whom who think that this benefit for high tech company and good for the economy because they need more people working in data field or CS field, for example. Not necessarily. I am studying Public Policy Analysis and I am confident to manipulate or analyze data like any other some Stem majors can. I and my friends even ask for lower salary than other CS majors people do. However, I can only have 12 months of OPT because my major is not listed in \"STEM\" majors. Dear everyone, you know that the name does not say it all, but how you know the tools and techniques matters. \n\nFor whom who say that I'm jealous of STEM people. I am applying to grad school and major in \"STEM\" just because I like it and it fits my dream. Even in the case when I get a STEAM major after I graduate, I will not support this petition no matter what because it is very unfair to all international students, to your peers.

We know that tech companies are willing to keep international employees because of their good performance. In addition, they need international employees to fill in the void in the tech industry.

This can be cause huge talent loss for those tech companies especially those who heavily rely on them. Extra OPT extension can relieve the situation by allowing international employees to have more attempts in the H1B lottery, thus reducing the chances of tech companies' loss on these employees.\n\nBesides, keeping international employees is not only good for tech companies, but also for each citizen in US. Tech companies rely on international employees to create values. The important thing is that the more values tech companies create, the more revenue they will have. This extra revenue will be converted to extra tax they pay to IRS, which every US citizen will benefit from.\n\nSome US citizens object this bill and are concerned that this bill will place international employees over US citizens in job market. I don't think this is going to happen. US citizens is always on the top priority in the tech companies list because they can work here without any restrictions. Tech companies don't have to file H1B petition and worry about potential loss of employees like what they need to do to international employees. It was because of the lack of labor in tech industry that international employees can have an opportunity to come in.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students is also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. \n\n Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. \n\nOn top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. I am not an economist, but I work in the computer industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. What about international students? If they achieved a bachelor or master's degree in the US, usually they have spent more than $100,000 in education. It is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. \n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!\n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 2006-2012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n\nAdmitted, international students' participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all - every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. \n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Qing Deng (2nd Comment)", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22023", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "As a international student in the STEM field, I strongly agree with the new OPT extension rule.

This is not a policy just benefits F1 students with STEM degrees, but in fact, will greatly enhance the leading position in high-tech areas for United States. \n\nMany opposing comments here have some misunderstandings about OPT and STEM extension here. F1 students CANNOT do whatever job/research. We can only get trainings in CERTAIN high-tech areas (i.e STEM) that is the SAME with our degrees. And the reality is, for non-high-tech areas, many firms limit visa status for job applicants. Also, as I said before, we CANNOT work on those non-high-tech areas. \n\nAs for high-tech areas, let's take engineering for example, you could hardly see many native United States students who are willing to learn this kind of areas, especially for Master and PhD students. But on the other side, many companies are desperately needing people in high-tech ares like Compute Science and Electrical Engineering. Since they cannot hire enough native American students, they have to hire foreign F1 students with STEM degrees. So, do we STEAL your jobs? The answer is NO, we could only take jobs that are actually abandoned by native American students. If someday there are enough native students who are willing to study in STEM areas, majority F1 students with STEM degrees would be kicked out of this country after graduation, because a native student usually is more competitive than an international students if they both have same level of technical skills since native students have better culture fit and better communication skills.\n\nSo, please DONT EVER SAY that F1 students with STEM degrees could STEAL jobs from American people. We CAN'T. \n\nNow let's look at how this policy could benefit United States. If all these students leave immediately after our graduation, which country do you think can get benefits from us with high-tech talents? Maybe India, China, or Russia, but definitely it would not be United States any more. U.S has the No.1 research capabilities in high-techs for now, other countries would be very happy if U.S could training talented people for them. From another point of view, many F1 students with STEM degrees, especially PhD students, are the leading force for researches in universities. We are contributing to United States to hold its position as No.1 in high-techs. Many top leading researchers like Zhijian James Chen currently in United States were also F1 students previously. You could find people like him in every top universities.\n\nThis policy could definitely help United States utilize high-tech talents for a longer time, and keep its No.1 position in the world.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhoucheng Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15688", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think this is a good move as the current H1 B program is becoming difficult to get through day by day because of the number of applications.

I earned BS in botany from Michigan State University, MS and PhD in plant pathology from Iowa State University, and later MS in statistics from University of Wisconsin--Madison. I worked in agricultural research for 10 years and worked for 15 years in medical and health research. I have publications in top journals (such as Archives of Ophthalmology affiliated with the Journal of the American Medical Association). I have good references.  I lost my last professional job in January 2012 when all 3 of my closest coworkers were non-citizens, all in the process of renewing their visas. I was top of my consulting class, the capstone class for the MS in statistics. \"\n\nMy view: OPT extension is applied to companies which are e-verified and will not place any discrimination regarding to nationality when they are making a decision who to recruit.  The company has the right to choose whoever it believes are most valuable to itself.  Many international students are particularly weak in language compared to American counterparts.  But the company will still choose them.  The only reason is that they are more excellent in academics and skills.  In fact, this person seems to have mistakenly confused the people who are on F1 OPT status, who does not have to renew visas and will not remain in US for immigration purposes, with the people who competed with him for the job opening, who are H1B workers with an immigration intention.  So the comparison he made here is not proper as a comment to this new rule.  By the way, our government has not changed its H1B quota for quite a long time.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\"Much of my job competition comes from the 75% of my fellow statistics students who were non-citizens. \"\n\nI'm not sure how he get this number from.  If this is incorrect,  it is not a valid argument.  If this is correct, then let's imagine that 75% of statistics students will be sent back to their home country.  Unless the position/student ratio is equal or less than 1:4, the companies will not be able to recruit enough people.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\"Faculty want to hire workers at 50% time to avoid paying benefits, or they want to hire full-time non-citizens avoiding payments for social security and avoiding payments for Medicare. Hiring a non-citizen on a non-immigrant visa leaves the worker vulnerable so the hires will easily relinquish their right to authorship, another unfair attraction to employers. \"\n\nMy view: These are all his suspicions and I don't think these are the actual reasons why the faculty will take foreigners.  It seems he believes faculty recruit people just by how cheap they are and how easy they can be mistreated.  Please, this is high-level academic work and I don't believe people's ability is not even considered.  I'm an international student here and I can tell you I never have this kind of feeling.  My advisor treats everybody equally and puts particularly more time in revising my papers and presentations because I'm not very good at english.  Even though some faculty will consider more about cost when hiring people than their ability, I don't think the majority of faculty members are greedy and shameless like he described.  \n\nHe wrote:\n\n\"The MS in statistics program has not changed appreciatively since I graduated in 2004, but I now have 10 years more experience than the current graduates. I have good references from statisticians and medical research clients. \"\n\nMy view: The program has not changed much but the students have changed a lot.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare.

The country have spend huge amount of money, time and other resource in educating them.

I am an international STEM graduate student from China. Following are my reasons why this STEM OPT-extension proposal should be approved:\n\n1) When I was choosing the country for my graduate study, I had multiple options like United States, UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore, etc. The most important reason I chose United States is the OPT program for foreign STEM students. I believe that most international students' purpose of studying abroad is to receive good education and industry training. So the OPT-extension is very important for United States to attract foreign STEM students. Without a good OPT policy, I don't think US could still be the most popular destination for international students. It is a fact that highly educated international students are making contributions to this country. So OPT-extension is a win-win policy for both Americans and international students.\n\n2) Regarding the length of OPT, I believe a regular 12 months plus an extended 24 months is a suitable length. According to my discussions with my friends who are doing their OPT programs in US technology companies, most of the projects they are doing require a period longer than two years. The result of a short OPT duration is that foreign STEM workers will not be able to finish a complete industry training program, and it is also really bad for their companies. Hence, I think a 24 months OPT extension will prove itself as a wise decision.\n\n3) The most common point I saw in those negative comments is that US citizens will lose their jobs because of international STEM students. In my opinion, it is totally a misunderstanding. As I mentioned in my first reason, the purpose I came to US is to receive better education and industry training, not \"stealing\" Americans' jobs. I was born and raised in China, and I will eventually go back to China after I receive the education and training I need. \n\nIn conclude, I support the STEM OPT extension proposal since it will benefit both the United States and international students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zhuan Zhu", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15201", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Legal American Citizens \"MUST\" always come first.

Most of them wish to put their knowledge gained in school into practice after they finish their study. As is known to all, this country leads the world in science and engineering fields, so a huge number of workforce is needed. Those international students will provide huge profits to the country's economy since it is comparatively less paid to them than to U.S. citizens. Here the competition does exist, but that is also the key factor how the country becomes the greatest one in the world. This will definitely impel everyone to study and work harder, which will greatly help boost the country's economy. \nIf the OPT extension is cancelled, there will be huge loss to thousands of US technology enterprises. There are still thousands of hundreds of international workers work on F-1 OPT status, if they no longer have the work authorization, they will be asked to leave to country immediately, which leave the companies the problem of recruiting new ones.

During the OPT time, international students, who have learned a great amount of knowledge from the U.S. university, can actively find an internship in large corporations, making great contribution to the U.S. economy. In contrast, for U.S. citizens, many students are unwilling to join in the STEM careers. If the OPT is only limited to 1 year, then international students may not be able to continue their job after the OPT, thus, resulting in serious human resources problem in big companies as well as in high-tech fields. \n2.The U.S. attracts the international students from all over the world not only for its high research level, but also for its diversity. When the OPT is extended, international students are able to work and study in the U.S. further, enriching the cultural diversity. \n3.Many great breakthroughs in STEM fields were made by scientists and engineers without U.S. nationality. The U.S. is tolerant to the variety in culture and nationality, thus it is why that America developed so quickly in the past several decades and became the strongest country around the world. Extending the OPT is definitely a way to further maintain this developing trend because this proposal can continuously attract more outstanding international students. \nIn conclusion, this proposal is definitely a beneficial for the development of the U.S.!\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by YANJIAN YU", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15021", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly agree that there should be additional OPT extension for STEM students with F1 visa.\n\nSome Americans oppose this policy while do not provide valid data to support their opinions.

As the study shows, many are hired by well established E-Verified companies that demands fresh blood every year. On the other hand, the newly proposed mentorship program re-emphasized the goal of the program. Companies control their own autonomy and their own rigorous screening procedure would block under-qualified candidates any way. \n\nAlso, on a standpoint of fairness, I'm concerned that the alternative 1:no change is not fair to the students who are already on STEM extension or would be eligible for extension after February. Most policy changes would have a grace period with some grandfathered guidelines and I'm very surprised to see there aren't any. Because the abrupt overhaul, many employers would face labor shortfall in the upcoming winter and I doubt this would help the gradually recovering economy.  \n\nSome leading arguments from the opponents are:\n1) Some argue that international students are competing for jobs. This is oversimplifying the issues in the US's labor market. STEM-OPT candidates all have at least earned one higher education degree and they are not allowed under the current regulations to pursue jobs outside of their study discipline. Therefore, they are not taking away jobs that are lower skills\n\n Furthermore, as those international students can only apply for E-verified companies, it helps the US employers to pick their best candidates from a wider pool. The longer 24 months STEM-OPT extension enables the employers to focus on getting the most suitable candidates for the position without worrying about potential loss of the person for uncontrollable reasons. Again, employers as freewill market players will naturally prefer the best candidates they can find no matter where the person is country of origin. \n\n2) Other groups may point that longer 24 month OPT extension would leave more students to apply for H1-B and Green card. Of course, immigration policy is a long term discussion point in the congress that may put many on alert. However, I'd like to remind them that we do still have a quota for H1-B and prospective candidates still need to go through the current lottery process to get a visa. Therefore, as long as the H1-B quota is not changed, the increased term of STEM OPT extension would not affect H1-B visa issuance.\n\n I'd also like to point out that although different parities have their distinct views on H1-B and other related immigration policies, the general goal is to make sure that the US stays in the leading group of the international community. If the country ignores the strong willing of US educated and willing intellectuals, it's likely that they would later send discouraging signs to other incoming students. To extend the STEM-OPT is more than a policy change but a signal and gesture that the country is still willing to take high skilled workers if they suit the growing needs of the economy. I'm worried that if the country continue to cast barriers to foreign students, there will be less and less of them coming. \n\n3) Anther opinion against the proposal is that it would waste taxpayer's money. This is simply not true after reviewing the cost analysis in the support file \"Initial Regulatory Impact Analysis\" file. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Sherry Sun", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21879", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The OPT program proposed by Home Land Security is nothing more than an effort to circumvent the hiring and training of American workers and to bring in cheaper and younger foreign workers.

If the OPT period is too short for students like me to gain much practical experience, academic institutions in US will be hugely impaired in the abilities to attract the most talented students. Considering more potential opportunities and benefits from other institutions worldwide, students may elect to go to places like Europe or Australia, which will undoubtedly cause bad influence on the innovation capability of United States.\n\n2. E-certified companies will hire international students only if they are in shortage of domestic employees. Extending the OPT period will provide more choices for those companies in need to prosper, while shortening the OPT period will only make it harder for them to compete with other companies worldwide with more beneficial policies.\n\n3. For exceptional employees, E-certified companies would like to keep them by helping them applying for H1b visa so as to stay competitive. But considering the fiercer and fiercer competition for receiving H1b visa, 36-month OPT is much more reasonable, because those already-well-trained exceptional employees would be less likely to be forced to leave and help other companies worldwide getting stronger.\n\n4. Domestic employees with same level of skills are always much more preferred than international students by all companies. So extending OPT period will not damage citizens well trained to find a good job. Only very limited amount of citizens with no appreciated skills might have more struggles. But shortening the OPT period will not help them get more skillful. Instead, it is more likely that they will become less ambitious and losing the desire to learn, as it suddenly becomes easier for them to make a living. This could potentially be the start of a lazier and less competitive country. For leaders of the most powerful country in the world, shutting the door for competition should be the last thing to do.\n\nIn sum, the new proposal brings more benefits to international students, and in turn even much more benefits to American academic institutions and companies.

The following are but a few. \n\n\nD. Mentoring and Training Plan\nThe Regulation does not care if the student is taught anything at all because the Regulation leaves it to the UNTRAINED employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for STEM OPT students.  The employer is in business  not education.  \nIt Is Noted That The Regulation Does Not Refute That The U.S. Has Plenty Of Home Grown Scholars And Stem Student. \nThe Regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign student. In stead, the Regulation leaves it to the imagination of the employer DHS anticipates that employers have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices. Of course, the ambiguous lanague is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law.   \n\nThe Regulation failed to mention the most obvious documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers are the employers payroll and personal records. What an employer is paying his current employees is direct and relevant evidence of how and what the employer values competent work.  In stead, the Regulations allows the employer to hide the documents that it actually relies on and use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys, to set compensation for their U.S. workers.  In short, the Regulations allow the employer and DHS to ignore reality (I.e. what is actually happening) ad substitute fantasy (i.e. what the employer and DHS hope is happening.) \n\nThe Regulations describe employers hiring high skilled STEM OPT students, thus accepting as fact that foreign students are already highly skilled in spite of the reality that the Regulations have already stated that the need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced  foreign student. \n\nFurther, the Regulations would not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business but, in stead, would open such definitions to the world by provid[ing] the Department of Labors Office of Foreign Labor Certification.  \n\nThe Regulations fail to protect U.S. workers because the Regualtions fail to gage the wages of U.S. workers. In stead, the Regualtions help ONLY the imported foreign students in gauge[ing] compliance, employers would be required to provide DHS with student compensation information, which would better situate the agency to monitor whether STEM OPT students are being compensated fairly. \n\nIf the DHS cared to protect the U.S. worker, then, the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. EMPLOYEE. That would protect the U.S. worker. \n\nThe regulation provide for on site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should/must conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet BOTH the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S. workers is in any way adversely impacted.  Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the  PAST FIVE (5) YEARS WITH NAMES, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS. \n\nThe Regualtions fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regualtions or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers.  The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.   \n\nFinally, the Regualtions fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regualtions. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regualtion, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for  fraud leaves the victimized American still goes without proper compensation.] \n\nOf course, the message form this Regualtion is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.   \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Otto (2nd Comment)", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1400", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I really appreciate the rule proposed by ICEB to increase the STEM OPT period from 17 months to 24 months.

I am an international student and I feel the need to speak up observing many US citizen's negative comments on how we are taking away their jobs.  1. For STEM majors, most positions we are after, with all due respect, are not what some US citizens can or want to do. The jobs we do not only contribute to the US economy but also scientific and other academic fields. Quite contrary to taking away jobs, which no offense, was not why some US citizen are unemployed, it is precisely what we do that enables many US citizen to live with better social welfare, more advanced technology and stable economic environment.  2. OPT STEM students, like me, have received years of education in US. We are grateful for the amazing education environment and awesome academic atmosphere we enjoyed and we would love to give back to the society. It is our gratitude and appreciation that motivate us to apply what we learned and contribute to the very nation that welcomed us in the first place.  3. Historically, it is the accepting culture that paved the way to where US is today. It saddens me that the society shows little toleration to intelligent international students, who just like their forefathers, have been trying to contribute to the nation we love and care about.

However, according to the law, international students who apply for the OPT could only find major related jobs. For example, a student with a computer science degree can not get a teaching job during his OPT. So those companies won't and cannot hire those students who have the STEM degrees to do job that not related to their major. Therefore, students who have STEM degrees won't make those students without STEM degrees harder to find the job.\n\nSecond, as I know, lots of my friends no matter they have or don't have the STEM degrees who will apply for the OPT are just want to supplement their academic experience with practical experience in order to improve their own professional aptitude. They are going back to their own country when OPT expires. So even if those students may increase the competition of job hunting for those american students who have the STEM degrees, it won't lasts long.\n\nLast, I don't think the increase of job competition is a bad thing for US society.

International students that have paid for the extraordinarily huge amount of tuition should have the same right to work in the U.S. As the odds of getting H1B visa are getting more and more slim, students with developed technical skills should have longer time duration to stay in the U.S. and more chances to apply to H1B. If this proposal didn't pass, it would certainly discourage talented students to even come to study in the U.S., and there would be a huge loss for U.S. economy and the development of U.S. education.\n\n2. Not only are International students able to contribute what they have learned for the companies, they are also able to contribute different point of views because of their different background. It is certainly foolish to deny the significance of diversity, which actually makes the U.S. one of the greatest countries on Earth. The diversity that international students bring to Universities and workforce enables American people to know the world better in terms of economy and politics.\n\n3. We can't deny that we may increase the competitions at the workforce. However, as the American economy is booming and unemployment rate drops to a historically low level, America needs a large labor force to make its economy better. International students that always have strong work ethics are the best group of people to successfully make that happen. In most cases, competition is not a bad thing. It usually makes the market more efficient. Those Americans that didn't get jobs that they should have if there was no international students taking their positions probably will work even harder and get other better jobs after they refine their skills. If they never work hard and always blame other people taking their jobs, they wouldn't get a job even if Americans deported all the international students. Other American people that have better skill sets would take their jobs anyway. At that time, I wonder who they would be able to blame on.\n\nAs U.S. is the land that rewards hard work and we believe as firmly as Americans that hard work does eventually pay off, we should get the same chance as Americans to use our skills in order to make the U.S. and even the world a better place.

Thus, in the long-term view, international students helps to keep US universities's global leading status.\n\nFurther, someone only complain the possible threat from those international students, they fail to see the great benefits to the community.

First, US needs a larger technology workforce to maximize economic growth, which is essential and ensures recent fed rate hike won't do any harm to the economic recovery; and students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in other ways of finance, medical research, etc. Moreover, the employers rely heavily on the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT.\n\nI suggest you to welcome the new proposals and without this the students will leave the US and there will be brain drain and students will be losing the touch on the Stem degree advancements and experience.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Grace Chen, CMU", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-5930", "postedDate": "2015-11-05T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "The rule is very clear and the document gives a lot of information.

I learnt a lot and was hoping that I could keep my journey here in the Bay area as an engineer. Things may not be an issue if it was 10 years ago that after one year of OPT I could apply for the H1B visa and could most likely get approved. However, today the applicants of H1B are more than it could serve. This is the objective fact that I can not change. However, there are two facts that I feel it is urgent to extend the opt to in total 3 years for STEM. First of all, even with the heated competition in obtaining H1B, there are still some consulting companies in bay area who applied for several H1Bs for one applicant just to expand the chance of the lottery. I feel this is highly unfair and hope this issue be attended to. Under this situation, it is less likely that one can get H1B within one year. Once we do not get it, there is a large quantity of employees the company needs to relocate which is highly inefficient and expensive. With the extended opt, this will relieve the pressure on our shoulder as well as the companies. Secondly, it is widely known that most of the companies in bay area rely on the foreign employees. If they only have one year of opt, even the fresh graduate got hired, after one year they will no long be able to maintain their position and will greatly affect the functionality of the company. I always think that the most attractive mindset that the US government has is its open arm to the outside world. This makes you competitive and outstanding. Thus I highly suggest that you should extend the opt to in total 3 years for STEM.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will have to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n \nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. More importantly, providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. The contributions of Skilled immigrants to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yan Kang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-14813", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "\nExtending the OPT period for F1 students is good for US economy growth.

It is a fact that it is very hard to hire proper and talented persons for most companies. And companies need to spend lots of labors, time, cost on hiring process. The worse part is when companies find the right international students, they need to worry about their status, because international students may have to leave no matter how talent they are because their status. It will be a big cost and waste for companies, which will slow their growth. This situation may keep happening unless talent international students can stay in the U.S. for longer time legally.

And in order to keep America's leading position in the high tech area, it is definitely not wise to block these well-educated highly skilled high tech work force outside of America. Especially when nowadays there are many countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. And this means that if America doesn't focus on enhancing our nation's economic, scientific and technological competitiveness by finding new ways to encourage talented international students to become involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. Then it is very likely that America will lose its leading position to countries like China, who has the most STEM engineering graduates every year in the world.\n\nThere are people objected to the 17-month STEM OPT extension on the basis of potential negative impacts on U.S. workers in STEM fields. However if you read the initiative carefully, there are terms and conditions modified in the STEM OPT extension in order to protect U.S. workers from possible employer abuses of these programs.or instance, any employer wishing to hire a student participating in the STEM OPT extension would, as part of a newly required Mentoring and Training Plan, be required to sign a sworn attestation affirming that, among other things: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives. And there are actually more terms and conditions involving how to protect American works' rights. With all the terms and conditions above, I think we can fairly say that for the STEM area, the international students and American students are treated equally.\n\nLet alone saying that one of the most important reasons that American education institutions remain highly competitive is that these institution can attract the most talented students and research staff among all the world. And one thing these people value is that they can also gain experience in America's high tech industry, so this is actually a very beneficial cycle, many international highly skilled and educated people come to join in America's high tech industry, which definitely would prompt the development process of high tech industry, a more successful industry can then attract more talented people around the world, which means this could be an endless power source for America's high tech industry.\n\nAs for why the extension is 24 months but not shorter, it's because the duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. Affording greater participation in STEM training through changes to the period of the STEM OPT extension would also help the nation and its academic institutions remain competitive in light of global efforts offering international students longer post-study training experience without restrictions on the type of work that may be performed. Fostering integration of research and education through the types of programs, projects, and activities described above will help recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. ombined with the initial 12-month OPT period, a maximum 24-month STEM OPT extension would provide students a sufficient opportunity to participate through the life of such a grant. Accordingly, and following consultation with the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation (NSF), therefore an appropriate benchmark for the maximum duration of OPT for STEM students is the standard duration of an NSF grantapproximately three years.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jacob Hooks", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-15979", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Agree with this.

Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nInternational students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.\n\nRejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!. from: 1point3acres.com/bbs \n\nWhat is worse, I believe the American salary level would be severely BROUGHT DOWN rather than driven up by this decision. On the contrary, let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.\n\nAdmitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all  every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.\n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Jiaxi Wu, University of California, San Diego", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11472", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I can not believe that Americans are doing this to Americans, you can not make America stronger by replacing American workers with aliens.

The international students bring huge benefits for US, especially for those industrial fields which hire STEM academic students. The international students boost our economy and their presents bring more possible employment opportunities. I work in IT company, in this fields, so many excellent employees are from international students and they are the backbone of this industry. They work hard, work great and pay many taxes, you cannot imagine the picture that if we excluded them out of this industry by shrinking OPT period, I can say that 50% talented people in Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook and so many other major companies would be lost!!!! The STEM students support our STEM industries, without them, the entire industry will suffer from a huge blow!\n\n2.Many people claim that international student brings down our basic salary standard and are responsible for SE and IT economy depression.This is total wrong!!! The STEM academic students have nothing to do with this issue at all. Almost all the STEM students are highly educated intellectual, their salary is much higher than basic standard, so they are not the reason why our basic salary is low. And the reason why our economy growth in computer and IT industry are weak is exactly because that we reject those STEM students to stay and turn to employ inexperienced people. (Needless to say that those inexperienced \"cheap\" people drag our basic salary down, not STEM students) We evict the most innovative and hard-working people we once trained in our top education institutes, they come back to their own countries and also take away our ideas and knowledge, that is why our economy is so bad and is losing competitive power!\n\n3.Rejecting STEM extension is not the symbol and foundation of our nation, the free and dream land that accepts and evaluates people by ability, not the BIRTH PLACE. Yes I admit there might be some short period of relief. but in long term, this is total wrong! We are excluding the innovative creators and job creators that we train well in our universities. (Go to any famous university and check the engineering department, especially CS and EE department, I can say almost 80% graduates and PHD are international students! And check all the famous professors in STEM fields, most of them are from other countries!) Huawei in China now is the largest IT and communication solutions provider in this world, not Cisco or other US company, why?

It will cause unpredictable loss to related industries during a short period of time. Taking the IT industry as an example, the high technology companies in Silicon Valley relies heavily on the expertise of their employees working under F1 visa, and a sudden termination of those employees working under OPT extension would certainly result in a stagnancy of related projects and researches. \n\nSecondly, the new extension rule would continue attract the best and most excellent international students to come and contribute to US. On the other hand, the invalidation of STEM OPT would harm the development of science and technology in United States, longterm-wisely. Over the past few decades, the fast development of technology-intensive industries at United States would not happen without the contribution of excellent international engineers and scientists. The outflow of these high intelligence people is not only a waste of the educational input that US has already paid, but is also a negative signal to future international applicants. Without the attraction of potential working opportunities, international students would rather choose to attend graduate school in Europe, Singapore, or other countries who can provide better working opportunities. \n\nThirdly, the 24-month extension is extremely necessary. The project's period in research and development divisions in the industry usually lasts for more than 1 year. Taking the pharmaceutical industry I am working at now as an example, the drug development process usually takes 2 to 3 years to complete one phase of clinical trial. The completion of a project requires adequate period of time, and the new rule guarantees that the completion is possible. It is beneficial for the career development of international employees and the companies themselves. \n\nIn summary, we should definitely support the improving and expanding of the training opportunities of international students. It is a win-win action for both international graduates and the nation itself, for no matter short-term or long-term. The United States should always keep its door open to attract the most excellent international individuals to come, and I believe the new STEM OPT extension rule is a great stimulation to it.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Belle Shi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12609", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

I support this rule for following reasons:\n\nFirst, it is good for American companies. Most programs and projects in companies last more than two years. If there is no OPT extension, companies would be forced to hire employees continuously, which would cost much more additional money and time on training new workers and constructing efficient teams. If new graduates can get more time with OPT, there will be no need for companies to worry about hiring newbies frequently. So that these companies can devote money and time to more important fields, like research and expansion. Take myself as an example. I did an intern last summer at a company. The company gave me a return offer since I became familiar with their development process during internship. They have no need to spend time and money to hire other people, which I think is a great help for the company.\n\nSecond, it is good for STEM industry. Why Google and Facebook are so unique in the world? Because they have creative people and have creative products. With extension of OPT, more people with creative thoughts would join these excellent companies. Thought spark generated by discussion between extraordinary people from all over world would lead to new advanced technology and even revolution in technology. In my opinion, this is great for American high-tech industries.\n\nThird, it is good for local economy. When a F-1 student is working uder OPT visa, he needs a place to live and need to buy necessary home furniture to live well. It is beneficial for local real estate industry and economy. What's more, he needs to buy food, buy cars and etc. All of these can be a contribution to American's GDP.\n\nSo I support this OPT extension proposal and I think it is a really great one.

International students are creating more jobs and at the same time boosted up U.S economy significantly. Note1: International students contributed more than 26.8 billion to the U.S and 340000 jobs during 2013-2014 (nafsa.org).  International students are paying double amount of tuition than U.S. Students. I personally pay 39000 per academic year without even count for the summer school tuition, just because that I am an international student. All those money would go towards U.S citizens for their social security, health benefits, etc...   \n\n\tLarge U.S corporations such as Apple inc., Ford, Google are crucial to U.S economy and offer most job opportunities to U.S citizens.  Many of those companies are running globally since globalization plays an essential role in the world economy. Without enough knowledge of other countries' culture, many U.S. companies can face conflicts or misunderstanding, which could result that U.S companies lose the high potential international market. Because those international students know both cultures in the U.S and their homeland, they can be the best mediators to help U.S companies to enter markets of other countries. Hence, international students play an important role to insecure those U.S companies well functioning in global market.  \n\n\tInternational students especially in STEM degrees are just simply filled up the spot that U.S citizens do not want. We need to be honest and face the fact that not everyone has great passion for math, physics, statics and other majors in the STEM categories. Those majors as very difficult majors and hard to graduate from. Notes2: In a Statistical Analysis Report \"STEM Attrition: College Students' Paths Into and Out of STEM Fields\": it indicates there are \" [a] total of 48 percent of bachelor's degree students and 69 percent of associate's degree students who entered STEM fields between 2003 and 2009 had left these fields by spring 2009. Roughly one-half of these leavers switched their majors to a non-STEM field, and the rest of them left STEM fields by exiting college before earning a degree or certificate.\"(Chen, 2013). Why there are so many International students choose STEM degrees? One of the reasons is that many U.S students tend to graduate from the communication, social study rather than physics or engineering. So, international students simply chose what U.S students do not tend to choose. To be clear, I do not make any universal claim that U.S students do not choose to get STEM degrees. In fact there are U.S students have great passion in those majors, however, not as much as majors in non-STEM.\n\n\t International students are also filling up the jobs that U.S students in STEM degrees do not want as well. A lot of companies prefer U.S new graduates rather than International new graduates unless; the job is not the best interest of U.S students.  My friend, who is also an international student, got a job offer. The job is project based which means that it requires him to move to another city every 5-6 months after finishing a project. I guess most U.S students would not take this offer because they attached to their friends and families. \n\tTherefore, to extend the OPT would be beneficial for both of the U.S citizens and international students. \n\t\n\nNote1 : http://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/\n\nNotes2:\nChen Xianglei, \"STEM Attrition: College Students' Paths Into and Out of STEM Fields\", URL:  http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014001rev.pdf\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yao Chen", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13126", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support the proposal of F-1 OPT extension. \n\nI am currently working in the national laboratory in USA with F-1 OPT status.

Such rule reduces our opportunities to find a normal job. The new OPT extension will definitely relieve our stress to some extent.\nAt the same time, foreign students regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students. \nIn fact, as an international student, I just want to work in America for some years and I would return back China eventually.

Wake up America, if you keep preventing the talented students staying in the States. We will be really disappointed.  \n\n3.

Likewise, had USSR kept all his scientists happily working, the cold war might last longer. The success of US in the last century are mainly due to his leading position of science and technology. Imagine if integrated circuit, genetic engineering and many other technologies nowadays shaped the world were not invented in US, will US still be able to lead the world?\n\nForeign students came to US for higher education are smart, self-driven and well-trained in Maths and Engineering. They come to US to pursue a better life, a successful career, a chance to contribute to the knowledge of humankind and solve the challenges of the world. At the same time, US benefit from these people on technology and economy. This is a win-win relationship. Many foreign students who later stayed in US have had very successful careers, especially in the area of high tech. The current CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai (originally from India) was a student at Stanford University. Elon Musk (originally from South Africa), who is the founder of Paypal, Tesla, and SpaceX, was a student at U Penn. When they graduated from school, they probably benefited from the OPT process just like everybody else. For all the people who claims that foreign students occupied their jobs, please take a look at how many jobs Elon Musk has created for US. \n\nStudents who are seeking for OPT and later H1B are not competing with Americans. On the contrary, they are helping US retain its leadership and grow its economy. I myself came to US in 2010 to pursue Ph.D degree in Geoscience. I was supported by a research assistantship to complete my study. Many of my peers at graduate school were in the same situation. In many departments at my alma mater Penn State University, especially STEM majors, international students make up about at least 50%.

First, companies do not pay lower salary to foreign STEM students. Companies like Google, Facebook and other IT industries pay the new graduate students at the same salary level. Even if there're difference in the salary package, it's not because of the nationality but of professional ability or interview performance. Not to mention that there're examples of foreign new grads who can obtain a much higher entry level salary due to their excellent experience or ability\n\n2. Second, extending the OPT STEM does not impact the employment of U.S citizens. It's misleading to put these two concepts together. Because the STEM regulation requires the students to work in the area that they studied and those fields are high tech areas, which in fact has lots of demand in the job market. There's no way for a U.S citizen who also studied in STEM area can not get a job. Also, It's misleading to say that these high tech positions could affect the other job market. Because in the job market that is not high tech, the STEM students can not even apply for those jobs. Those who claimed \"OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013\", how do they acquired the data? What kind of job positions did they include? Are those job positions even related to the STEM fields? There's no point in arguing using false or irrelative result.\n\nLast, there're a lot of benefits of extending OPT STEM. For one, this program is a very important reason for attracting foreign student to come study in the U.S. It gives them the opportunity to gain more than year's industrial experience to practice what they learned in their university, which in return brings lots of benefits to the high tech industries in the U.S as well.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Luc Peng", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13506", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this rule and hope there will be easier path for highly demanded high tech foreign students and degree holders.

Expending the OPT extension allows more time for them to contribute to science, technology and economy in US. Without their help, the science of US may not develop as fast as it is today, and the economy of US may be in danger of depression.\n\n3. F1 students in STEM major creates a lot of working opportunities for others.

As we all know, the silicon valley even contributes more than 1% of GDP in the US.

This win-win example is a compelling evidence that the US should welcome this STEM related students.\n\nSecond, this extension and expanding will no do harm to the employment rate of the US citizens. From my personal experience in Indiana University, less than 1% American Students major in STEM and most of these students can get a job easily upon graduation. This implies that non-immigrant students have little of an effect on the employment rate of US students.

During their stay (including OPT extension), they can support a new company until the company can find more experienced and senior engineers. This is not a immigrant proposal, after all.

There are my arguments.\n\nFirst of all, the action taken by DHS is to include a STEM OPT extension as part of the OPT program under the F-1 nonimmigrant classification in order to better ensure, among other important national interests, that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally. \n\nIf U.S. does not come up good and friendly policy for the F-1 nonimmigrant students, many international students might go to countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China that are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. \n\nFor example, Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022.\n\nSecond, enabling continued extended OPT for qualifying students with experience in STEM fields is consistent with DHS's Study in the States initiative, announced after the 2008 IFR in September 2011 to encourage international students to study in the United States. That initiative particularly focused on enhancing our nation's economic, scientific and technological competitiveness by finding new ways to encourage talented international students to become involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. The initiative has taken various steps to enhance and improve the Nation's nonimmigrant student programs.\n\nThird, I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my friend previous work experience at Google, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the completion of the projects.\n\nAs I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from U.S. university to U.S. high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in U.S., I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.\n\nHope more people support this good rule!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yingyezhe Jin", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-12268", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "OPT extension is beneficial to American\n\nFact: American's creation is built on diversity.

Said Vivek Wadhwa, from Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University.\n\n          Paul Feltman, Chair of the steering committee of IMPRINT, a coalition of organizations raising awareness about the talents and contributions of immigrant professionals. He once said the below sentence that I totally agree:\"The promise of America is that were the land of opportunity. For immigrant professionals, that opportunity should include being able to work in the field for which they have already been educated. Im talking about meeting the same high standards for professional licensing as American-born applicants.\"\n\n          Making a talented person eligible to work in the US does not only help one person provide for his/her family. It helps the employer who needs his/her skills, the community where he/she pays taxes, and the region in which he/she lives. \n\n          I strongly support the OPT extension proposal because the worlds best and brightest should be welcomed. And I believe as wise as the US government is, they should already found out the importance of foreign workers.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Tianyi Zhang, Purdue University", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11049", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I Strongly SUPPORT this new rule to extend F-1 STEM OPT program!\nIt is a great idea.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Same X", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-11599", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "STEM students are really good at science related work.

Firstly, most of the OPT students around 70 % are misusing OPT period by joining an INC Consultancy faking their resume or identity following illegal, unethical process. Secondly, OPT students are never been paid until and unless they get a contract job with the client and will be paid mostly on 70-30 percentage basis. What is this percentage basis? i will tell you suppose if a consultant gets a contract job with client and if he is paid 60 dollars per hour as a billing rate then the the consultant gets 70 % of it and consultancy gets 30% of it. Every consultancy says that consultant is paid on salary basis but no everyone are paid in percentage basis if he has a job he is paid if not no he will not be paid. I agree that some are genuine OPT students who does not do any unethical or illegal activity but the ration of genuine to fake/unethical students who utilize/mis-utilize OPT is 20%:80%. Whats the use of it and at whats costing USA for this i.e. agreeing to OPT rule will be no doubt mis-utilized. Faking at least 8-10 years of experience which is costing less number of jobs available to genuine people. Yes there will be more people who supports OPT rule mostly students because they have spent money for their masters by taking loan and other stuff but if they really want a job they have to get a job in ethical in a lawful way. But i am one of the person who genuinely writing to let you know please don't, don't invite unlawful activity again. People in OPT can go for genuine full time jobs but they will not get as they don't have experience or will not be paid much so they will be told by all these INC consultancies that if they will fake their resume and do little hard work at client's location they will paid good money so almost every student opts for that.

Many of my non-citizen friends went to other countries such as Canada, Swiss, etc. or back to their home countries. They took it. However, for these years, the industry seems booming again. There are more and more positions opened last year. And I have heard more and more positive news from my friends. The whole country is reviving.

The student are going to contribute back and the companies profits from their training program. A win-win situation should be everyone's goal.

The Reasons are as follows:\n\n1.\tInternational students have historically made significant contributions to the U.S economy, through the payment of tuition and living expenses for self and family. Therefore, they are deserved to have more opportunities and time to seek job in US market and longer time to practice the skills in US companies. Right now OPT is the most common way for international students to practice their skills after graduation. Revoking the extension rules will let all international student rethinks their plans to study in US and have forced current skilled students to leave US.\n\n2.\tSTEM students contribute more specifically to a number of advanced and innovation fields by conducing scientific research, developing new technologies, advancing existing technologies and creating new products and industries. However, right now the timeline of getting work permit as well as seeking work opportunities for SETM students is very tough. Extending the time from 17 months to 24 months will become a big relief, and allowing more STEM students to work for US companies and help in US economic growth.\n\n3.\tNow a plenty number of international students using the STEM OPT extension to maintain their legal working permit because they were not selected from H1B petition lottery. The extension status not only allows them to continue working, but also provides more times to let to attend new h1b lottery in following years. If the new STEM OPT extension rule is not passed. The current STEM extension rule will be revoked in February, 12, 2016. International students US company such as Google, Amazon, facebook, and a lot of high-tech startups, who mostly hire STEM experts, will lose the talents. This will definitely impact the industry and harm the US companies.\n\n4.\tForeign students significantly promote cultural understanding, and contribute to the overall economy by building global connections between their hometowns and U.S. host cities. In the meanwhile, US companies also need to maintain cultural diversities to get a wider view in the global market.\n\nIn all, I do hope the new extension rule can be passed. The new rule will accelerate the US economy from all aspects. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kemengtian Ma", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18843", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the proposal.

US is losing its leading status in the world and this process would accelerate if US continue say NO to these foreign well educated students will degrees. OPT is a policy that attract talented students around world coming to study in US. Other countries have given similar policies. If US don't extend it, US would lose these clever heads.\n\n4. Illegal immigrants and students with STEM degrees are totally different. Illegal immigrants are not qualified for STEM job as lack of a degree in US and then find jobs in non-STEM fields with higher unemployment rate. Then US should say no to illegal immigrants, not students.\n\n5. US tax payers don't need to pay for foreign students' education as they study in their own country before and these students also pay high tuition and fees in US which are great funding sources for US universities.\n\n\nReference\n[1] http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/25/smallbusiness/stem-facts/\n[2] http://www.renewoureconomy.org/research/help-wanted-the-role-of-foreign-workers-in-the-innovation-economy/\n[3] http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/job-vacancies-and-stem-skills#/M104204\n[4] https://www.nms.org/Portals/0/Docs/Why%20Stem%20Education%20Matters.pdf\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Kun Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18278", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the rule to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. \n\nI am an international student currently on my OPT visa, and a recent graduate from Stanford Engineering, right now working in the technology industry in the United States. There are several reasons of why I believe OPT extension is important and beneficial for US society. \n\nFirstly, the practical training opportunities are what make the United States academic institutions more desirable for a foreign student. There's a traditional saying in China says learn in order to practise. I came to Stanford not only because of the opportunity to learn the knowledge from the world-class professors, but also practise what I would have learnt in a professional setting and solve real world problems. The OPT extension rule provide me exactly the opportunity to have industry immersion in the US. Without proper OPT rules I would have chosen other countries or regions for my graduate work. This is not only me, but also most if not all my classmates from my college that chose to study abroad, that chose the US instead of other countries because of the opportunities to have a reasonable training period after graduation. \n\nSecondly, the practical training opportunities have given those innovative companies in the US, especially here in the Silicon Valley, like Google, Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber, etc. great sources of talents. I can hardly imagine how these companies and other startups will suffer from the loss of STEM talents. \n\nThirdly, I want to add on why the extension is necessary and important beyond the 12 month OPT program. Based on my experience, most projects in either academic institution or at a company would take more than 1 years to develop and complete to have a real impact on society or economy. If the training program is limited to only 12 month, many projects will face frequent turnover and lead to inefficiency. In the meantime, for new employees in the engineering disciplines, it will normally take about half year or so to really get adapted to the working environment and ramp up, and a limited 12 month OPT will severely impact the actual work effectiveness. \n\nFourthly, I have read reviews stating that many employers are paying students on OPT training programs low salaries thus made the job market more competitive for the American citizens and I want to have a rebuttal on such statements. Firstly it is not true that foreign students on OPT training programs are receiving low salaries. Students who have STEM degrees are highly desirable on the job market and are highly valuable resources for the US economy. Many of my colleagues, classmates and I myself who are foreign students in the tech industry have a very competitive compensation package from the tech companies. As far as I am aware of, the average starting salary of the master students from the Computer Science program from Stanford is about $115, 000, and the average starting salary for the international students in this program is almost the same with that figure. Secondly, foreign students may work on projects that are expanding the international markets for the US companies and Uber China Growth team, or LinkedIn China team are both great examples of such, which actually require the international background and are jobs that do not directly compete with local candidates. Thirdly, some foreign students from the STEM degrees are actually starting their own companies in the Silicon Valley which actually create more job opportunities for local candidates, and Instagram is a great example of such. \n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Zetong Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8210", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think the STEM extension should be for 36 months instead of 24 months.

I believe the 24 month OPT STEM rule will benefit the economy of US dramatically, and makes US a more competitive and attractive country.\n\nIn my opinion, OPT STEM will not prevent US citizens from obtaining enough work opportunity. For non-STEM areas, OPT STEM does not apply to international students at all, which means the work opportunities available to US citizens in these areas will not be reduced at all. On the other hand, in STEM areas, although OPT STEM allows more international talents to work in US, it will also increase the absolute amount of working opportunities to US citizens in the long term.\n\nUnited States, as a country built by talents from all over the world, is currently the most creative, most productive and strongest country in the world. This is due to its open policy for importing talents, regardless of their citizenship. People with extraordinary skills are the key to improve the power of the country and push the development of the society. This is especially true in STEM areas. A country without rapid economics increases will never have enough energy to create sufficient open jobs in the market, making the country less attractive to hi-tech workers, thus slowing down its development even more.

I believe the rule that is being proposed has numerous benefits, including boosting US domestic job growth, preventing brain drain from the US, and reinforcing and enhancing diversity in both the US labor market and population.                                             //                          \n\n\nFirstly, I argue that, instead of distort the domestic labor market, F-1 students with STEM degrees can help the market growth and create new jobs. The most common comments that opposes foreign students working in the US is that they distort domestic labor market. Such comment is merely groundless. For example, in the University of Michigan, one of the top universities with high foreign-student population, F-1 STEM students contributes to only about 10% of the total number of STEM students. Such small percentage of students can hardly distort domestic labor market. Not to mention their language barriers, government restrictions, and their connection with original country. A small portion of them who actually have a chance to work in the US are fairly competing with domestic students. However, one cannot neglect foreign students' contribution to the growth of labor market in the STEM field. High-tech companies or financial institutions in the United States faces intense global communication, international businesses and foreign investigations. With their solid skill sets, multi-cultural backgrounds, and already established open-minds, foreign STEM students working in the US strongly supports the growth of these companies, which greatly contributes to US economical growth and, undoubtedly job market growth.                                             //                                            \n\n\nIn addition, expanding training opportunities for F-1 STEM students certainly slows down brain drain from the US. While the US still leads the worldwide technology innovation, scientific breakthroughs, and global economy, one cannot overlook the fast growing foreign competitors in the technology and financing sector, like China, India, South Korea, etc. F-1 students with STEM degree from these countries might be a small group in the US. But back to their original country, they are the real core strength, leaders, pioneers, in their fast-rising domestic companies, which are already growing exponentially, with increasing global market share. Setting aside these students who decides to go back right after graduating from a US university, imagine a F-1 STEM student already worked for a big tech-company, like Google, Apple, Facebook, Morgan Stanley, etc. At the end of his/her OPT, because of unestablished policy, he/she has to leave the US and go back to the original country, which welcomes him/her with high salary, management position, leading a domestic company. It is not only a great loss to Google/Apple/Morgan Stanley, but also to the United States. The US should keep these students with knowledge and experience, instead of letting them go and making the US less competitive in global competition, which is already taking place.                                            //                                   \n\nLast but not least, F-1 STEM students should stay because they are a big contributor to the diversity of this country. With their unique culture backgrounds, bilingual abilities, F-1 students have already diversified the working environment of the companies they are working for, contributing the growth of their companies by their unique insights, foreign experiences, solving problems with different perspectives. Off from their work, they are an independent minority group, lawful, regularly paying tax, boosting demand, and bring various cultural elements to the domestic various domestic industries, such as food, education, art, religion, and even medical. Comparing to illegal immigrants, which is a far more serious issue to the society and the job market, F-1 students who stays in the US have much more positive contributions to this country in diverse ways.                                             //                                         \n\nThe United States of America is known for its open-mindedness, diversity and domestic harmony.

Citizens and Natives. The citizens are members of the civil society; bound to this society by certain duties, and subject to its authority, they participate equally in its advantages.  The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country, to parents who are citizens.  As the society cannot exist and perpetuate itself otherwise than by the children of the citizens, these children naturally follow the condition of their fathers, and succeed to all their rights.  The society is supposed to desire this, in consequence of what it owes to its own preservation; and it is presumed, as matter of course, that each citizen, upon entering into society, reserves to his children the right of becoming members of it.  The country of the fathers is therefore that of the children; and those become true citizens merely by their tacit consent.  We shall soon see whether, on their coming to the years of discretion, they may renounce their right, and what they owe to the society in which they were born.  I say, that, in order to be of the country, it is necessary that a person be born of a father who is a citizen; for, if he is born there of a foreigner, it will only be the place  of his birth, and not his country.\"   \nAn alien is a person born out of the jurisdiction of the United States.\nIt is indispensable, too, that the president should be a natural born citizen of the United States; or a citizen at the adoption of the constitution, and for fourteen years before his election. This permission of a naturalized citizen to become president is an exception from the great fundamental policy of all governments, to exclude foreign influence from their executive councils and duties. It was doubtless introduced (for it has now become by lapse of time merely nominal, and will soon become wholly extinct) out of respect to those distinguished revolutionary patriots, who were born in a foreign land, and yet had entitled themselves to high honours in their adopted country. A positive exclusion of them from the office would have been unjust to their merits, and painful to their sensibilities. But the general propriety of the exclusion of foreigners, in common cases, will scarcely be doubted by any sound statesman. It cuts off all chances for ambitious foreigners, who might otherwise be intriguing for the office; and interposes a barrier against those corrupt interferences of foreign governments in executive elections, which have inflicted the most serious evils upon the elective monarchies of Europe. Germany, Poland, and even the pontificate of Rome, are sad, but instructive examples of the enduring mischiefs arising from this source.\nUnder our Constitution the question is settled by its express language, and when we are informed that, excepting those who were citizens, (however the capacity was acquired,) at the time the Constitution was adopted, no person is eligible to the office of president unless he is a natural born citizen, the principle that the place of birth creates the relative quality is established as to us.\nSen.

Here are some facts about myself and why I believe this new rule will benefit foreign students and the U.S. people at the same time.\n\n      1. When I finished my bachelor degree in my home country and planned to pursue further study in my major, I once hesitated among an ivy league university in the US, a British golden triangle and a well-known Swedish University. It was the fact that the U.S. was willing to provide convenient access to real working experience that encouraged me to finally choose to come to this continent which is so far from my home country, China.\n\n      2. Why is the U.S. working experience so important for me? Some people may doubt that whether I will finally stay in the U.S., struggling and chasing for the U.S. citizenship. Don't be silly. The only reason why I prefer to stay here and work for 1 or 2 years is that with this kind of oversea working experience, I will easily find myself a well-paid job when I go back to China. In my field, in the U.S., a new bee's annual salary is around 70K, and a senior can make as much as 100~120K; while in China, a new graduate can only earn 30k per year, but an experienced professional and make up to 150K, especially when you have oversea working experience! With such high salary and low living expense in my home country and ultimate possibility for personal improvement, do you really think I'd rather stay here, stealing jobs and accepting unfair working conditions and being paid a meager salary?!\n\n       3. I understand that people are unsatisfied with the number of the unemployed rate. However, the truth is, most of the unemployed people, even given the chance, they are still not capable of doing what a well-trained OPT STEM graduate can do. Contrary, they should count on those STEM professionals to create more job opportunities for them. Job opportunity is never a non-renewable resource. The job market can flourish and it can also shrink, depending on whether there is a healthy, active, and liberal environment for economy and technology growth.\n\nSeclusion is never a good attitude for a country, especially in this globalized industrial world.

It is more than life time savings of many families in third world countries. Risking all our life time savings, we spend it all to get better education. Programs like OPT save us from going bankrupt and help us in part to recover financially. Graduating from a world class Computer Science school like Carnegie Mellon I am sure I would be quite resourceful for my employer and there are many passionate individuals like who have talent and ideas in abundance and wish to start companies that could very well become the next Billion dollar companies. Most comments I have seen which oppose STEM extension cite the burden on tax payer or employer willingness to hire cheap labour because of the 7.65% tax rebate OPT students get while being employed but please note that It is equally taxing for the company hiring us to sponsor our work visas, hire lawyers and bear with the uncertainties of our work visas and employment status. Hiring a foreign national on OPT costs the company more than what it takes to hire an American national. Implementing this rule will have significant benefits for students like us and also reinforce a belief in students who are thinking about studying in the United States. \n\nWhile every good thing has side effects, OPT can become a double edged sword. DHS needs to be careful about the repercussions of this rule (how abusers are going to abuse it). Most hi-tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple etc. do not outsource their core engineering to other consulting firms. But many organizations which do not wish to invest on their engineering can outsource their tech work to other consulting companies. More provisions can be added to the rule which makes it harder for consulting firms which are looking for cheap labour and are in turn exploiting vulnerable newly graduated students who are neck deep in loans and are willing to work even if they are underpaid to recover financially. \n\nTo summarize, Not having OPT will seriously discourage STEM students from pursuing higher education in US.

This is very beneficial to American companies if international students have 24 months of OPT.\n\nAs a stem student, I do hope that OPT extension will get approved and make this win-win situation happen for US universities, companies and international students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yuqi Bi", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8635", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Really think it's a good idea!", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by sam JMS", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10186", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Our immigration system is not being inforced.

As with all affirmations contained in the Mentoring and Training Plan, the employer would attest that these commitments are true and correct to the best of the employer's knowledge, information and belief. \nAdditionally, the proposed rule would require that the terms and conditions of an employer's STEM practical training opportunityincluding duties, hours and compensation  (56)  be commensurate with those provided to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers. Work duties must be designed to assist the student with continued learning and satisfy the existing ICE guidelines for work hours when participating in post-completion OPT, which are set at a minimum of 20 hours per week, and would be so defined under this proposed rule.\nThis will make sure that Its Americans first , and no cheap labor . It always have been like that anyways , if there is an competitive American in the STEM field they get hired first , they are always given priority ..reason being which company wants to keep the workers that are temporary ! none ..the only reason they want to hire one is when they don't get enough local candidates... but this rule confirms this fact as a rule ... like the incidences like the one happened in Disneyland never happens again .... you cannot LAY OFF any American worker as a result of hiring any foreign worker under this program , the problem of cheap labor is also resolved anyways.\n\n3)DSOs would be prohibited from recommending a student for a STEM OPT extension if the employer has not provided the assurances required by this rule or is otherwise not in compliance with the relevant reporting, evaluation and other requirements described in this rule. Additionally, DHS has the ability to deny STEM OPT extensions with employers that the agency determines have failed to comply with the regulatory requirements, including the requirement to formerly execute the student's Mentoring and Training Plan and the requirement to comply with the assurances contained therein. ICE may investigate an employer's compliance with these assurances, based on a complaint or otherwise, consistent with the proposed employer site visit provision discussed in the following section. These safeguards will more effectively ensure that STEM OPT students achieve the objectives of their courses of study, while benefiting U.S. academic institutions and protecting U.S. workers. DHS requests comment on the feasibility and effectiveness of each of these provisions, including the obligations to confirm (1) that the terms and conditions of a STEM OPT student's employment are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers, and (2) that no U.S. worker will be terminated, laid off, or furloughed as a result of a STEM OPT opportunity.\n\nthis means that first off USCIS will conduct strict site visits to make sure that rules are being complied with , there are extremely strict requirements to which field I can work in if I am an electrical engineer mastering in power field I can only work in that field and there are checks of these kind they will prevent unlawful employment where in the people graduating in stem field work in non stem related field k, ,for example an electrical engineer working in the IT field , one advice is to Follow this rule very stringently ie there must be continuous checks , evaluations , from the USCIS to the stem graduates making sure that there is absolutely no room for illegal work , by that way we all are at peace , only highly qualified people are retained in this country , there is no cheap labor and there is no current displacement of American people from the job market .Incidents like Disland will never happen , as a matter of fact atleast in my field , we compete with ourselves , not with americans because they get the jobs anyways , its always easier for them to get a job provided they must Graduate with minimum score more than a gpa of 3 , those qualified Americans always get preference by electrical engineering companies. So its always Americans first , we compete among ourselves with whatever remaining jobs we have .. I do have data to proof this - \nAs for americans with stem degree not getting jobs has largely the way to do with how they perform at college , a candidate with a GPA of 2.5 , not even a 3.0 is one example of the above fact.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous  Anonymous ", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-18271", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I support this rule.\nWhy is there a problem now, when there wasn't any when we were paying thousands of dollars to the universities.

U.S. companies that hire foreign workers, those who are not American citizens, should be fined instead of given financial incentive.\n\nStop the gravy train to immigrants, F-1 visa holders and foreign students! AMERICANS need good full time jobs, not part-time (29 hour, thank you Obamacare) service sector jobs that hold no real chance of advancement, raises, and the security of being able to provide for our families. We need to come up with a plan to educate, train and mentor our own unemployed and underemployed student and professional citizens before all others.\n\nAmericans first. When we finally have a low 2% unemployment rate then maybe it will be time to try to train and educate some selectively chosen foreign workers so they can take capitalism back to their own countries and help them improve.  We do not need them to stay here waiting for more hand outs.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lynn McCoy", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4346", "postedDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.

This is a win-win propose to both American and F-1 nonimmigrant student. The immigration history of American can date back into 1960s. For nearly half country, talent immigrations from all over the world brings advanced academic knowledge, optimistic attitudes and passionate creativity to America. These people became part of elites in all kinds of area and make America grown into the most developed country in the world. That's the reason thousands of people praise highly of American education and good study atmosphere.  I'm one of the people among them. That's also the reason why I choose America to continue and improve my academic career. Everyone will experience the process of seeking jobs.  It is not easy and it spends nearly two month or more for seeking a position that suits you and they want you at the same time. It will spend a much longer time to make you familiar with the job and work with coworkers. From my perspective, the government should offer more opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students.  \nIt is not fair for spending half of the family saving to study in America but only 12 month for seeking job. These passionate young graduate need some time from university into the real world and contribute to society. There are a lot of twists and turns on the way of chasing dream and developing career.  But if the government make a small step to improve it, that would be a giant leap for these young ambitious talent people skilling the world and make America a much prospective society. \n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Vemmy Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-22400", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I fully believe that the STEM OPT Extension plays an indispensable role in the U.S. economic growth. I will express my opinion through the following aspects. \n\nEconomic Implications of STEM OPT Students in the U.S.\n1. Providing sufficient high quality labor force\n\tForeign students in the United States are valuable assets for the economic growth to the U.S. According to the research of Salzman, Kuehn, and Lowell (2013), the domestic supply of IT workers exhibits increasing but slow growth in line with market signals. The OPT STEM extension can provide firms the access to labor that will be in plentiful supply. The labor force supply brought by foreign students is not only in good quantity, but also in good quality. As discussed in the previous section, most of the foreign students who are working with their OPT status in the U.S. receive high quality of education and training. Imagine that if without the OPT STEM extension, the supply of labor force, especially for the IT and engineering market, will drop significantly, which will increase the cost for firms because they need to spend more time and money looking for employees and training employees, thus causing a significant lost of resources and creating opportunity cost which can be devoted into more productive behavior. This will indirectly affect the economic growth in the U.S.\n2. Maintaining occupation structure of the U.S.\n\tAs discussed above, most of the foreign students of both bachelor and master degree pursuers are majoring in engineering and other science fields. After those students graduate, a majority of them will go to the similar fields to look for jobs, which is beneficial for the U.S. to maintain a high engineering occupation level. Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (2001) show that countries with a huger proportion of engineering college majors grow faster because engineers are more likely to involve in innovative behavior and increase the productivity, thus economic growth. If the STEM OPT extension stops abruptly, it will lead to a drop of engineering occupation level and disturb the occupation structure of the U.S., which possibly slow down the U.S. innovation steps and economic growth. \n3. Retaining well-educated STEM OPT students is huge human capital gains\n\tSince the STEM students learn the advanced skills and knowledge from U.S. prestigious universities, if the U.S. government can retain more STEM foreign students, it means the U.S. can gain more human capital. Under current H1-B visa lottery process, with more and more inflows of foreign students but not changed quota in the H1-B pool, it becomes harder and harder for the STEM students to win the lottery and stay in the U.S. This leads to a great lost of human capital. According to Romer theory of revised Solow Model for explaining the role of technology change in economic growth, human capitals available for technological research plays a very important part of spurring the technological change. The STEM OPT extension will enable the well-educated STEM OPT students to get a bigger chance of winning the lottery and continuing contributing to the U.S. technological and economic growth. \n\n\tAs a result, I believe that high-educated STEM foreign students are great values to the U.S. economy. I am firmly convinced the fact that the STEM OPT extension can help the U.S. economic grow in more productive, inclusive, and sustainable ways.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yi Wang", "attachmentCount": 1, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-4609", "postedDate": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "We give too little to legal US citizens and much more to non legal people and it should not only be reduced but stopped until our real (NOT FUZZY MATH) employment is good enough to provide our legal citizens a chance to obtain a good education and a well paying job.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by James Morris", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-7106", "postedDate": "2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "United states was an original immigrant country.

OPT program is designed to let the talented people stay and contribute to this country more before they leave. Most high tech companies are depending on this program to easily hire the most talented people from all over the world. As we all know these high tech companies are the backbone and the future of this country. They are affecting the way people are thinking, are changing the way people are living and also creating more and more opportunities. Take Uber as an example, there are countless engineers with OPT helping it functional properly. It not only change the way people calling a cab but also creating countless jobs and so many people are even living on it. \n\nI saw many people are talking about the job opportunities are taken by the student with OPT status. But is that really true? Taking CS as an example, the number of well trained CS graduates are far smaller than the actual needs on the job market and that's why the salary for an junior software engineer are far higher than the other entry level job. So the reality is we need OPT program to help the graduates stay and fulfill the market.\n\nInstead of cutting this program, we were and should be extending it. By extending this program, the high tech companies will have less pressure of looking for talented people and focus on developing new techs and creating more job opportunities. Because they are recruiting the talent from the people from all different countries and don't have to mind there visa problem. This is especially good for some small start ups with infinite possibility. These start-ups are the core value of American spirit and new American dream. Nobody knows how many Googles, Facebooks are born among them.  These companies are generating billions of economy volume and thousands of job opportunities.\n\nAlso, in order to face the threatens  from other countries, extending OPT program is playing an more important role. The talents are the life of a country. Extending OPT program are providing the talents from other country an opportunity to contribute to ours without consuming too much social resources.

That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.\nOPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.\nBecause OPT workers are technically \"students,\" employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees.  That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.\nOPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.\nOPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.\nOPT expansion is overtly unfair to the foreign students in that they are not given raises and are forced  work for lower wages than other STEM graduates.  I have known many of these people and the first thing they do when they are green card eligible is to quit and apply for another job at double their current wage.  \nI have also noted that many of these graduates have absolutely no hands on skills.  They do not understand the basics of mechanics and how things work in the real world.  That is a very dangerous situation for the consumers of products they design and build. \nAlso, many of these students come from underdeveloped areas of the world.

I read a lot of comments and will list several explanations and benefits of this policy regarding those main concerns in the comments. \n\n1.  The main concern of this policy is that it would affect the job market in US. However, most of jobs in US are non high-tech jobs, and one of the main factor that affects those jobs are illegal immigrants. Since OPT only allows students to take positions  related to their majors, the students cannot compete with US citizens in the traditional job markets, so the most \ncompetitors are actually illegal immigrants. Furthermore, my experience is that US companies prefer US citizens since they do not require any other processing or fees for H1B, and they do not have deadline for positions in contrast with international students who hold OPT.\n\n2.  The OPT extension policy will help the high tech industry grows faster. Actually, there are many positions in demand that cannot be fully filled by US citizens. One example is data scientist. \n\n3.  I am a PhD student in the field of machine learning. Most of my friends are in the field of machine learning, artificiall intelligence and robotics which are emerging high tech fields. If they do not have OPT extension, they have to go back within a very short time after graduation. This would cause many talented young people to flow away.\n\n4.  If the industry is growing, the number of positions will increase. However, if the industry is lack of enough energy, then the job market will shrink accordingly. So in my opinion, the number of jobs is not determined by the foreign students who hold F1 visa, but but the whole status and environment of the industry. International STEM students can help grow high tech industies healthy and energetic.\n\n5.  Internation students help local economy grow. According to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students and their families have contributed $26.8 Billion to the US economy and created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Bingwen Zhang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-19901", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Approve it.\n\nOtherwise these talented students will go back to their country and would establish more bigger companies which would affect Us in future.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Aditya Mathur", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-20066", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "To be honest, as a sociology student, who is not a stem student, I am fully supporting this policy.

We should be aware of the fact that the percentage of the local US students of STEM is obviously much lower than the other fields. That means if we do not extend the OPT, there will be much less students working for the high tech companies, and the labor force in STEM field will run down rapidly. \nSecond, someone may argue that the H1-B are the same (36 months), but please notice that there is a strict H-1B quota in each USCIS fiscal year and a policy that people who applied for STEM are only allowed to work in e-verified companies. If OPT for STEM is 36 months which means even if STEM students can not get an H1-B eventually, they can still work for those US companies for 3 years which makes real contribution to the companies/organizations since the initial training would take up a long time. It will be a waste of resource and time for both the companies and students if the students have to leave when the students just have gotten familiar with the industry and the operations of the companies. \nAll in all, the OPT extension will benefit for the US government, the US citizens and the international students.\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Liz Luo", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21321", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I think it's just wrong that the spontaneous I getting everything  foreigners I getting everything free while I'm here working my butt off with a job paying off student loans what's going to happen with my grandchildren they have to pay they away and people can comment to my country and get whatever they want I think it's wrong how about taking care of American people first before you take care of these people in another country  they do not belong here how about if the government pays all my student loans off and here we have American people but I can't find jobs but yet the government is going to let them have free school and then jobs what's wrong with this picture I think it's time to stop and not give out   Green cards  if they want free education let them do it in their own damn country it's time for the American people to have a new ministration ", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Dawne Ciambrone", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-9414", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongely support this rule for the following reasons:\n\nAs an International student, I choose to study in America because America can provide OPT extension after I graduate from university.

We pay a lot of tuition fee to American University, I think if America stop opt program, America will lose this financial income every year in the future.\n\nSecond, we don't grab US citizens' job because of a lower salary. Sometimes, American work positions in stem field can't find a suitable US citizen to do , so American company need an International student to do these. If opt extension rule can be approved, America will attract more talent and smart and Intelligent International students to come to America. These talent and smart and Intelligent International students will make a lot contribution in American companies, and this rule will help to improve American competitive strength in the world directly.\n\nThird, I will go back to China at last. However, I think 12 month regular+ 24 opt extension is a good length for an International  student. Because it can benefit me to enhance my working experience overseas, and if I have three years working experience in American companies, it can enhance my competitive strength after I go back my country to find a good job.

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies \nto hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their\nF-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the\ntime to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in \ncertain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them \nwhen they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 \nmonths, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign \nstudent's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for \nAmerican workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding \nunnecessary job competition to the mix.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to \ncorporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from \none year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid \npaying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy \nbusiness owners at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a \ndetriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire \nforeign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of \navailable workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put \ndownward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign\nstudents because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should \nserve in the interests of American workers, not against it.\n\n\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Frank Schultz", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-8385", "postedDate": "2015-11-10T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support the OPT extension for STEM students, diversification is what makes U.S. strong", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Yu Wang", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-10666", "postedDate": "2015-11-11T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "Currently, there is an undersupply of qualified STEM graduates for jobs that are getting increasingly more technical.

However, the major employers of those OPT visa holders are in high tech industry. The reason They hire those foreigners is only because of number of US citizens in high tech job market cannot fulfill their demands. Otherwise, no employers will be happy to pay same amount of salaries with extra visa commitments to those foreign workers. So This indicates that those foreigners do not occupy positions of our citizens in a large scale.\n\nMoreover,  OPT STEM visa is considered to be non-immigration visa. So a large part of those foreigners will finally back to their home countries instead of staying in US. When OPT STEM extension collaborate with small H1B quota, and long green card waiting time, the policies help US citizens to stop immigration waives while keep foreigners serving for us for a long time.\n\nIn conclusion, STEM policies help high our tech industry grow, and also collaborate with H1B and green card policies to stop immigration waives while keep the foreigners working for us.\n\nConsidering the benefits for US citizens I stated above.

First, some people say that the stem students occupy the working positions and make US citizens loss the chances. Is this truth? Absolutely not! Most stems students are do jobs which US citizens unwilling to do, such as software engineer, data scientist, and mechanical engineer. And some people said, though the influence are minor, but the influence is exist! I totally agree with this and I want to say that, the influence is exist, and it is totally positive influence. Because of stems students, in those fields that US citizens unwilling to do, we still stand at leading position. For example, IT field, we have Google, we have FaceBook, we have Linkedin, these companies hired lots of stem students. And stem students are the reason help these companies in the leading position. If without them, US citizens doesn't want to do jobs like these. This companies will be soon instead by the companies in India or China. And at that time, even some US citizens who are interested in these field, cannot find a suitable position. And the hot positions produced by this companies like  consultant and product manager will also disappear. So in conclusion, the stem students are the most excellent students in other countries. Most them do the jobs that US citizens unwilling to do. They help these field develop quickly and produce more changes, changes for other US citizens. And help our country stand in the edge of science and engineering. Therefore, stop you stupid negative comments. If you really think they use the chance of yours, why you spend more time to study? I think the company prefer to hire you even if you only spend half of the time in study compared with stem students.", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Lingda Li", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-21693", "postedDate": "2015-11-13T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

I think this rule can benefit both US society and international students so I support it. I fully understand the worries from many US people, but I also think from the perspective of US, this rule is also beneficial.\n\nFirst, although competition can be extremely hard and brings lots of stress, it also push people to learn to stand out and to make a contribution. From the long run, competition help society pick out those people who can really be worthy for the country. This is similar to that wild animal can survive the severe environment while domesticated animal cannot. Smart people know competition actually will not destroy them but to make them better.\n\nSecond, this rule can reduce part of the H1B visa. For some F-1 students, they only plan to work in US for 2-3 years. the short opt time require them to get H1B visa so they can stay in US for the third year. However, if they can work with their opt for 3 years then they don't need companies to apply for H1B for them. this is not only a financial save for many companies but also reduce the pressure of H1B visa. If I am a manager that want someone to work on a certain project for 2.5 years and a certain F-1 student fully meets my need, with previous rules I will still not hire him because I don't want to pay H1B visa only for half year. But now with 3 year opt, I can hire the person who can fully create profit for my company, and even may create more jobs on the market!\n\nThird, with more international cooperation in this world, the country which refuse to open will be left behind. As a Chinese citizen, I have to say, the supportive rule of international students working in US actually causes a severe problem in China, many talented Chinese scientists come to US, doing valuable researches for US and all credits goes to US! We have a huge amount of high-tech people loss. So if US people don't want to pass this rule, then our valuable Chinese scientists will come back.

If we dont fulfill this quickly, there will be lots of negative effects appearing in different fields. I will present those in the following:\n\n1.\tIn the short term, a short OPT can severely decrease the possibility of companies hiring new graduate students. As we know, most international students are willing to study in the US, because they can receive better education, and the most important, they can find a job and stay in their dream country after graduation. If the OPT period is short or the OPT extension is terminated, thousands of international students will not continue their education in US, who have already gave big financial support for US universities.   \nBesides that, most tech companies in US will need more efforts to hire suitable employees from colleges, which will increase their operation cost.\n\n2.\tIn the long term, without the contribution from international students, universities in US will lose not only tuition income, but also talent resources. This scenario will lower their standards and suffer a drop in reputation and overall quality, which in turn make them less attractive to international genius. It becomes a vicious cycle! Then the US education will be down.\nFrom the perspective of industry, the decreasing of potential employees from new college graduate, will affect the quality of job market. To compete with other foreign companies globally, US companies must move their high tech departments to China or India, who have sufficient hi-tech labor. Otherwise those big companies like Google/Facebook/Apple/Intel would lose competitiveness, so as to bankrupt. As a result, its obviously that the job positions will be cut down accordingly. \nFurthermore, those side effects will make US lose her lead in technologies, and finally US cannot beat China/Germany/India in all fields.\n\nIn summary, Im happy to hear that 17-month OPT extension can be 24 months or more. As an immigrant country, the US should continually welcome more international genius, so that they can help keep her leading position in military, art, economy, medical, education, etc.\n\nThank you!\n\nBest regards,\nColin\n", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Colin Wei", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-1467", "postedDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00-04:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "I used to be an international student with F-1 OPT status.

Hence a three year OPT program will be beneficial in this regard.\n\n2. Hiring students on OPT helps private companies save money on visa sponsorship. Hence, a three year OPT program will mean that for three years companies need not spend resources on visa sponsorship. So, this will in fact encourage companies to hire more talented individuals without bearing the cost of sponsorship.\n\n3. America has always been an inclusive nation which has given opportunities to individuals to create a shared vision. It is this belief which attracts international students to our universities. Today, a sizable portion of students in universities are international students. Going back to a one year OPT, might detract some talented students to go to other universities elsewhere.

International students need OPT STEM policy to fulfill their career tracks. Most international students want to have opportunities to have working experience after graduation in United States. If they cannot have extended working opportunities, then there is no difference between earning a degree in their own countries and earning degree in United States. \nWhen international students and American students learn in the same education program, all the students are equal. All students equally have chances to show their talents and compete for the positions they qualified. But without OPT STEM policy, international students cannot get the equal chance, because no employers want to hire a person who cannot even work over one year. In this situation, although international students put the same efforts (actually much more efforts since there are not too many companies hiring international students) with American students, they cannot get the equal career opportunities. \nInternational students have their home towns and relatives based in their own countries. Not all of the international students want to immigrate to United States. Standing in the pro status for OPT STEM does not mean pursuing an immigrant chance. OPT STEM gives us a good opportunity to challenge ourselves to solve real problems with applied math background. With the trend of big data in all industries, career market needs people with STEM majors students to provide more innovative and solid ideas to make positive progress. There are so many international students in STEM majors, most of them want to devote their efforts to make the progress move forward.\n\nThanks.\nBest Regards.\nXun Ma", "allowLateComment": false, "docketTitle": "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees; Cap-Gap Relief for All F-1 Students With Pending H-1B Petitions and Change of Status Requests", "title": "Comment Submitted by Xun Ma", "attachmentCount": 0, "numberOfCommentsReceived": 1, "docketType": "Rulemaking", "rin": "1653-AA72", "documentStatus": "Posted", "agencyAcronym": "ICEB", "docketId": "ICEB-2015-0002", "commentStartDate": "2015-10-19T00:00:00-04:00", "documentType": "Public Submission", "commentDueDate": "2015-11-18T23:59:59-05:00", "documentId": "ICEB-2015-0002-13837", "postedDate": "2015-11-12T00:00:00-05:00"}, {"openForComment": true, "commentText": "It is a good proposal encouraging more students to come to US for further education.

America is never a country who expel talented people, that's why we are prosperous over so many years. Those young students have received good education here in the states, we should help them stay here keep providing value to our industry instead of going back make contribution to their own country like China and India.\n\n2. We should never afraid of competition, any sort of protection is illusive. We should think more of how to provide better education to our kids instead of just expel kids from other country, that's just a false sense of comfort, we are living in a century full of competition, we can't escape from reality. \n\n3. Also, as I know, the job that allowed to use OPT extension are all STEM related which requires higher education. We don't have enough people who are capable to do those work instead of too many. I live in silicon valley, from what I know, many company can't find enough US citizen who got the required skill and knowledge even if they prefer to hire them. \n\n4. International students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. \n\nAmerican people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest.

Less and less students will choose European universities which used to be the best choice to study aboard since they do not have chance to practice after graduation. Knowledge can not be truly gained unless you practice a lot, and US has the best opportunities for these guys.\n\nSecond, these technical talents should contribute to US and US really need their contribution since their skills built and knowledge gained because of US university, and their contribution will absolutely make US prosperous. As we all know, US is a country see very high on diversity and this diversity makes it the strongest country in this planet. For example, during WW2 hundreds of scientists migrate to US including Einstein, and they were respected and make great scientific breakthrough here.\n\nThird, the technical filed really needs thousands of talents to join and develop new technology, and the number they need is really huge. Thus, I do not think this rule will not make US citizens harder to find a job in technical fields. On the contrary, it will just urge technical talent to make more progress.

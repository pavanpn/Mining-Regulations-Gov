A major problem is that this rule would provide superior help to students who are not American citizens, assistance which is not available to American students.  This discrimination is unconscionable.  Effectively the federal government would be taking better care of non-Americans than it does of American students.  A further result of such action is that it discourages American students and will surely drive many into other and probably less lucrative professions.  So this disadvantages the American student, but it also disadvantages the American employer and the American economy.\n\nThere is another problem:  why are we doing this?  There is no shortage of STEM workers or graduates in the U.S.  And the federal government's first obligation (or at least it should be) is to support Americans and American students.  Our immigration policies should be focused on actions that support the American people and the American economy.  When there is no shortage of STEM workers, it is unfair to American taxpayers to advance a program that has no marginal benefit to the country or to Americans.  So the whole premise of the program is faulty.\n\nThe OPT program has denied Americans 430,000 jobs from 2009 to 2013.  Such disloyalty to American workers is unconscionable.  But the disloyalty to Americans doesn't stop there.  This program has been funded from the Social Security Trust Fund and the Medicare Trust Fund, sources unrelated to the intent of the program, and trust funds that are in trouble financially as it is.  Bottom line is that we cannot afford to deplete these funds particularly for a program unrelated to the Funds primary intent and because it adds to the burden placed on American taxpayers to deliver these programs.  In the case of Social Security, American workers have already contributed to the Social Security Trust Fund and the government has a financial obligation to those workers.  By depleting the fund for other purposes, the government aggravates an existing financial shortfall.\n\nFurther discrimination against American workers results because this program provides a source of workers whom American employers can hire more cheaply.  Though this may help American employers, it does so penalizing American workers and American graduates.  Bottom line, rather than expanding this program, it should be eliminated altogether so long as it clearly hurts Americans rather than helping them.\n\n", "confidence": "99.8309", "result": "Negative", "author": "Ronald Pierce"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0728": {"commentText": "That is great news!

This OPT proposal, like its predecessors, is a too-clever attempt by Big Academia and Big Tech to subvert the H-1B caps which American technology workers strongly support.\n\nAs Ron Hira et al have shown, there is no need for degreed graduates of US STEM academic programs to be treated as interns in need of 3 years of further training. This OPT provision merely seeks to provide Big Tech's bosses with more cheap, indentured labor, circumventing the H-1B cap. As Daniel Costa notes, this proposal allows bosses to decide whatever wage is appropriate for the OPT foreign worker, and this proposal's worker protections \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.\" This proposal will only serve to further depress already-stagnant STEM compensation and working conditions, and to force more US citizens to seek alternate career paths.\n\nAs John Miano indicates, this OPT proposal requires US corporations and universities to provide mentoring programs for OPT-eligible *foreign* students, but not for citizen students. This OPT plan, like (but even worse than) its predecessors, will only increase the US STEM brain drain by driving talented citizen students out of STEM, and to replace them with foreign students who are (as Norman Matloff has demonstrated) no more talented (on a variety of measures), but who are much more profitable for US corporations and universities.

There is still strong demand in the job market. This means that we can open up the opportunities to foreign students who study in the U.S. and have expertise. These students would fill in the positions which are left out of most Americans' interest. Most technology companies are built on technology immigrants, such as google, facebook and dropbox.

We can see the success of these firms, and we can certainly infer that with the help of the international students, the U.S. economy would be booming as well.

This proposal is certain to harm American technology workers. At a time when many American students are drowning in college debt and unable to get jobs in their fields, the US Government has no business expanding visas for foreign tech workers. Furthermore, these workers will have an unfair advantage over their American competition: Because they are technically students, their employers will not have to pay payroll taxes for them, saving the employers about $10,000 per worker for each of the three years they are in the OPT program. At the same time, because their student visas will be tied to their employers, these young workers will be open to exploitation.\nIn its initial attempt to expand OPT, DHS admitted that the extension was indeed an attempt to circumvent the caps on H-1B visas.\nNot only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their student visas will be tied to their employers). Further, because these workers are still technically students, they wont have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years theyre in the program. \n\nBefore this rule is approved, DHS should have to answer these questions: How many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers? How many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field? How the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment?\nBetween 2008 and 2012, technology companies spent close to $1.5 billion lobbying the White House and members of Congress on the immigration issue. As labor economist George Borjas writes, corporate lobbying on immigration should be the best piece of evidence needed to show that wages drop when immigration rises. As he says, why would employers tend to go to Washington and expend their resources lobbying for something that doesnt benefit them?\n\nI am a self-employed computer programmer and the mother of a college student.

During my Master's program, I worked for an American Company on an Internship (CPT) and right after my graduation I had about 3 offers from American Tech IT Giants. I'm one among those lucky ones to be a part of a reputed company. \n\nHere is the most important part about my feedback - While I was working as an Intern (on CPT Work authorization), I had other students working along side me on the same project from various companies. The sad part however is these guys were all on OPT and projected themselves as Senior candidates with 7-8 years of IT Experience. At the least they weren't able to speak proper English during Weekly/daily stand up meetings. \nAt that time in 2011 as an Intern, I was making around $26 an hour for the same job with better skills and these guys were making roughly around $60/hr. I don't have have a problem with these guys making good money BUT I feel there are other well deserved candidates missing out on good opportunities due to lack of process background verification process by Government Agencies while issuing OPT/STEM Extension permits.\nThe worst part of all is that some of these students had graduated from non-IT fields such as Environmental Engineering, Mechanical and Bio-Chemistry and yet they have been successful at getting into IT with 7-8 years of experience and with ease. This is just the starting point for them, from here they work with so called \" Indian Consulting firms\" aka body shops to get their H1-B and Green Card process filed and try to stay ahead in the PERM process than the actual talent who's still struggling to make progress in their career with the right experience (not faking it). \n\nI would like to end this here with a humble request to the DHS: \n1. Please enforce a proper system to perform appropriate background checks on every Graduate student at the time of applying for OPT and specially during their STEM Extension process.  \n2. Kindly verify if the student applying for a STEM Extension is working in their area of study.

If the Training Opportunities period can be extended, these talents will have more chances to get the H1B, which means they will have more opportunities to benefit this beautiful country.\n\nSecond, the extension of OPT can provide more powerful safeguards to industries in various fields to find more suitable talents and staff. For a company, it is not easy to find a very suitable employee. So with the expanding of OPT, American companies will gain more selection.\n\nThird, America is a country with a dream. She absorbs a large number of talents coming here to contribute to the country, since she never refuses people who have a dream. OPT extension gives international students more equal opportunities to realize their dream. That can also give those students more confidences to contribute the United States. \n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Yu Zhang, Texas A&M University"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1841": {"commentText": "I fully support this proposal.

For example, footnote (24) refers to \"Foreign STEM Workers and Native Wages and Employment in U.S. Cities\" by Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, Chad Sparber.  An updated version of this paper was released on July 1st and an analysis of it at http://econdataus.com/jole_pss.htm shows some serious problems.\n\nIn addition, a search of the comments for the number 2.62 or 262 show at least six references to another flawed study that is often quoted by proponents of OPT expansion.  One of them is labeled \"Mass Mail Campaign 22\" and contains the following statement:\n\n\"A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development.\"\n\nGoogling this sentence shows that it's source appears to be a sample letter posted by an immigration lawyer at http://immigrationgirl.com/f-1-students-tell-dhs-to-fix-the-2008-opt-stem-extension-rule-sample-email-here/ .  Interestingly, it appears that this sentence was taken verbatim from a 2013 article at http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/articles/26825/raising-cap-need-increased-numbers-h-1b-visas-skilled-workers .  In any case, an analysis at http://econdataus.com/amerjobs.htm shows that the 2.62 number is deeply flawed. It is the result of a study of the years 2000-2007.  If you use the exact same formulas but move the time span forward two years, to 2002 to 2009, the association becomes a LOSS of 1.21 jobs.  This strongly suggests that the positive association is caused by the inclusion of the tech crash and the steep job losses of both foreign and native workers in 2000 and 2001.  You see, a strong job LOSS in both groups is mathematically identical to a strong job GAIN of both groups, at least as far as the linear regression that determines the job change is concerned.  If the study's interest is the effect of an increase in foreign STEM workers, 2002 to 2009 is a much more appropriate period and this period is associated with a job LOSS.\n\nAll of this shows that you need to check that studies that you or your readers reference have been replicated and validated.  The fact that an economist has put their name on it is meaningless unless the study has been reviewed and validated, preferably by researchers on all sides of the issue.  In my view, the most credible evidence suggests that current policies lower wages and job opportunities for native workers.

Given the fact that we also pay a tremendous amount of college tuition, often without financial aid, I believe it is only fair that we are given adequate opportunities to pursue such academic experience through OPT as well as enough time to gain concrete experience. Being an international student from Ghana pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, I have experienced a number of disappointments regarding gaining internships due to my citizenship status and knowing that the current OPT system only allows 17 months to gain such experience makes tertiary education in the United States very daunting for my fellow-international students and me.

Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees.\n \n\nThe Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months\n\n \n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\n \n\nFormal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\n\n \n\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employers input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.\n\n \n \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\nRakesh", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Rakesh Ramesh"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2942": {"commentText": "I am very happy with the fact that DHS came up with better rules this time in order to benefit OPT STEM students.

I think this is the regulation will increase the comprehensive national strength of US and benefit general people who lives in this country. \n\nFirst of all, it will enhance US comprehensive national strength. As we all know, the composition of international students are young, knowledgeable, and full of creativity from all over the world. If we give them 24 month opt, they will have more chances to apply for H1B VISA and stay in US and working for this county. These students are very intelligent young people from all over the worlds. In school, they study dedicatedly and often times outperform domestic students. With them working at companies in our county, it will certainly increase the competitiveness of US companies in international market. Most of the stem majors are practical, we need those talented young people to work for our company. For example, the total revenue of Google is 66 billion in 2014. For employees in Google 83 percent of them are international workers, and most of them can work here because they have the opt extension and thus can apply for H1B Visa. Without this extension, I can see a great high tech company like Google goes its way down because lack of talents. It is not only a money problems. we know the IT is the representative of technology. It plays a incredible role in national defense and security. I can foresee the tragedies like 911, Snowden and political eavesdrop happens again at the time US lost its advantages in technology. Last year, US economy increased 2.4, most of the drive is from IT. I would say, without this opt extension, US will be in a huge trouble.\n\n2. Benefit American people\nThe average salary from H1B last year is about 100,000 each year. They pay average about 15 percent of their income to US as tax. We all know US is in big amount of debt for this social welfare which gives its economy a trouble. If we keep those young people in our country and let them keep paying taxes. It will release the financial burden of US significantly. With the taxes paid by opt users, we can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research.\n\n3.Other suggestions\nActually, the opt and H1b system is not flexible enough. There are too many uncertainties caused by the identity issue. This will reduce the attractiveness of staying in US. I suggest issue all international student who graduated from a US accredited university green cards. Also, those students who are not majored in stem are also very intelligent and worth to keep, we should give them the extension.

I learnt a lot and was hoping that I could keep my journey here in the Bay area as an engineer. Things may not be an issue if it was 10 years ago that after one year of OPT I could apply for the H1B visa and could most likely get approved. However, today the applicants of H1B are more than it could serve. This is the objective fact that I can not change. However, there are two facts that I feel it is urgent to extend the opt to in total 3 years for STEM. First of all, even with the heated competition in obtaining H1B, there are still some consulting companies in bay area who applied for several H1Bs for one applicant just to expand the chance of the lottery. I feel this is highly unfair and hope this issue be attended to. Under this situation, it is less likely that one can get H1B within one year. Once we do not get it, there is a large quantity of employees the company needs to relocate which is highly inefficient and expensive. With the extended opt, this will relieve the pressure on our shoulder as well as the companies. Secondly, it is widely known that most of the companies in bay area rely on the foreign employees. If they only have one year of opt, even the fresh graduate got hired, after one year they will no long be able to maintain their position and will greatly affect the functionality of the company. I always think that the most attractive mindset that the US government has is its open arm to the outside world. This makes you competitive and outstanding.

But these years US government has done well in this. You may argue it is the result of the low interest rates. Come on, it is just a few years after the financial crisis, many firms got broke down. If you know the market well, the technology firms as well as the technology itself contribute a lot to the not only firm wide but also the country wide recovery of the economy. And a really important factor is the STEM extension after 2008 which allow more technology and science related students to have more time to chase their dreams as well as contributing to the US economy as well as the firms. So it will not be surprised that many tech firms including Facebook, Google and Airbnb, are still keeping expanding the number of the international employees even they are so big now. Beyond that, for many firms other than the tech field, they are quite eager to get the tech-background people to make the firm work more efficiently, for instance, the tech side in the finance world or other industries. Yeah, you got it. There are still a gap between the need of the tech guys and the supply of them in US, and the former group is much much larger than the latter in job market.\n\nMore specifically, the STEM extension will contribute to the firms in US or some international companies who have branches in US.

These skills, like Internet Security, Mechanical Engineering, Geographic Information Science and many others, are highly demanded skills in the current job market. In other words, the job market is in short supply of excellent candidates. By 2020, employment in all computer occupations is expected to increase by 22%, but some IT fields will fare better than others, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) biennial update of employment projections. Providing STEM students longer timeframe would gave them a better chance to fulfill these demands in the job market. As the companies could find better candidates, they would have more economic contribution to the nation and pay more tax.\n\nSTEM graduates, who turn from bachelor to master or PhD candidates, will increase the overall labor quality of the nation when they are entering the job market. A labor population with better quality is critical to a nations economic growth. People with little education could only work for some basic jobs, while people with high education could work in high-tech sectors. The nation definitely do not want the major industry be the agriculture and manufacturing. Services industry is what the US is wanted. It is a few pollution, high profit margin, sustainable and environmental friendly industry. STEM subjects are exactly parallel with the services industry. With STEM students have more time to be authorized to work in the service industry, the more the US economy would be benefited from the enhanced labor population. \n\nMore time for STEM students work for the America would also help US to enhance its worlds leader position. The country has been a leader in a lot of fields in the world, and many of them are exactly STEM subjects like IT, medicine, engineering and science. Let STEM students work for a longer time in these fields would bring more diversity to the working and researching environment, as well as efficiency and energy. No field would achieve success if no one succeed. With STEM students continuing to push human beings discovering the nature, building better infrastructure, more secure and efficient web environment, the country would be benefited from that, with a stable and unshakable position as the world leader.\n\nSomeone may think these STEM students are taking opportunities away from the current citizens. I do not agree with that. Opportunities are only available to those who are prepared, and they are not affected by others. This country is a place that everyone has equal rights. There is no affection for non-citizen at all in the job market. Provided two candidates have exactly the same knowledge, a citizen would definitely get the job compared with a STEM student because of the no cost in work authorization management. If a person loses or could not get his / her job, it is not caused by STEM students but he / she is not qualified. We should not blame personal disqualification to STEM students. The STEM extension will be a good example of the Immigration revolution of the Obama government, even though F-1 students are only a tiny part of non-immigration legal residence in the American land.\n\nIn conclusion, STEM students with 24 months extension would increase the average education level of the labor population, bring more knowledge and benefits to US companies and economy, and lead to a more stable world leader positon of the United States of America.\n\nGod blesses the America.\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, as a STEM student who just start to work under OPT, I found my value could be used for the people, the government in this country. As a contractor of the USDA, I used my GIS knowledge learned from my Master degree to help the agency. My job duty is to do Python scripting, Geoprocessing management, publishing geoprocessing models and maps. These products will be used within the different department of agency. Some of them are used by field operators to monitor the conservation of easement. Some of them would help the field to have a better and faster planning process. Of course, some of them are solely to make the current workflow more efficient within the agency. I felt that Im blessed to have a chance to use my professional knowledge learnt from my Master degree to help the conservation of natural lands. I do not want to lose this chance to better serve the people, the America if I have to go back to my home country as the H1-B visa is way too much hard to obtain.\n\nI fully SUPPORT DHS decision to give 24 moths extension of F-1 students. \n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Simon Suo"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0404": {"commentText": "I complete support it!

I came to US in 2008 and am currently finishing my PhD. The education provided a rich depth of knowledge in field of semiconductors. But when I recently started to apply for full time positions, most of the openings require some sort of experience. This makes me ineligible to apply for most of the currently available jobs. \n\nThe 12 month OPT period will provide me with time to gain experience and build my professional resume. However, in order to work as a full time employee in US, I have to apply for a H1B visa in April next year. This will ensure that I can stop my OPT training period and continue as a full time employee. \n\nHowever, the allocation of H1B is done completely based on luck. The lottery system does not guarantees fairness to PhD students who spend much longer time in completing their graduate studies over MS students. Further, PhD students are a better value addition to US workforce compared to MS students. So, preference should be given to PhD students as far as allocation of H1B visa is concerned.\n\nIf I do not get a H1B visa awarded in the lottery system (which is completely unfair and does not take into account any merit based allocation of visas), I have to leave the country at the end of my 12 month OPT period. This means that I will have to leave country for a year and hope to get lucky in the lottery system next year. However, this is not guaranteed and I may have to wait several years before I may get a H1B visa. \n\nThis is a terrible misuse of money and effort which goes towards training STEM students, especially students who spent 5-8 years getting a PhD degree. Federal government and different funding agencies spent a considerable amount of money training a skilled work force. This workforce should be allowed to assimilate and contribute back to the prosperity of US economy. \n\nThere is already a shortage of skilled labor force in US. Terminating work authorization for STEM students will erode the strong and highly skilled workforce which US needs in order to stay competitive in this global economic environment. US is slowly losing its manufacturing jobs to India, China and other developing countries. In order to stay competitive, US needs to lead in higher technology and research environments which will help to maintain its dominant leader position.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nPurpose of the Regulatory Action\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is nobody's definition of temporary. As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT.

Graduates can work without being bogged down by complexities of obtaining a speciality occupation visa\n- EAD makes recent foreign graduates attractive to employers who have some appetite for hiring people fresh out of school but do not want to invest heavily upfront in them. Employers are able to take chances and dip into a larger pool of graduates and scholars\n- It lets students in Schools remain focused on what they came to the US in first place - to study and research without thinking too much about if they have to pack their bags and move out soon after graduation. One year in OPT is not nearly enough to allow people fresh out of school to employ their skills and find their calling. Like the great education schools in US impart, it is equally important to get a great grounding at work before students can go out on their own, to their home countries or anywhere in the world and do justice to their education and investments. Experience in US benefits the students, the society and organizations of all sizes in US.\n\nThere is another large pool of students in US, who are also non resident aliens but who are not on F-1 visas. They are partners of primary beneficiaries of workers in specialty occupations. Partners on H-4 and L-2, for example, or the beneficiaries of H-1 and L-1B visas themselves. While they may be attending school full time, they do not get the benefit of an OPT after earning their degrees. OPT and CPT should be extended to such students as well, to allow them to use their education gained in US without being chained by their visa classifications. There is a large pool of such dependent partners that goes to schools and works as hard, if not more, as students on F-1, but is deprived of an opportunity to be gainfully employed just because of their visa classification. H-4 EAD is a step in right direction, but offering OPT to students irrespective of their visa classifications only truly benefits all international students who work hard to make their dreams come true some day.\n\nAnother important aspect that DHS should look at is prevention of fraud in education industry. Especially, schools for profit that may be shops for obtaining a CPT and OPT while adding little value to students who fall victim to the lure of getting a work permit by enrolling in such schools. In the long run, students are deprived of quality education while racking up huge bills for tuition.

In the future, judges and government officials ought to explain to the American people the basis for their authority to allow foreign students to work while holding nothing more than student visas.\n\nIn addition to the employment issues, it is notable that employers who hire foreign students under this program will avoid paying employment taxes. Frankly this exposes a cynical motivation behind the expensive lobbying effort waged by employers in support of increasing the number of OPT visas. As if the detriment to American workers were not obvious enough, they are being harmed both coming and going--suffering from their jobs being taken by foreign workers, they then can anticipate less support from a government that has, in effect, given large corporations generous tax breaks.\n\nMy wife happens to be a green card holder--she and I were careful to complete the appropriate applications and pay the required fees so that she could gain her work and residence statuses through established legal channels.

To the international students, most of the time, the precious working experience is more important than a green card. Most of the international students in United States are from developing countries, like China and India. In these developing countries, they need these international students with a broader view and latest technologies more than United States. But due to the increase of international student population, most of the high salary jobs in these countries are only opened to internationaI students with enough working experience and the staring salary in these countries is not comparable to developed countries like United States. This is the reason why lots of new graduated international students want to find jobs in United States and stay here until they can get a working visa. However, if they can have a total 3 year working experience in United States, I think most of the international students would love to come back to their home country after this period instead of get a green card and stay here forever and the job openings will not be occupied by international students in a long term. And this will encourage more and more international students to come and study in United States and bring huge profits in this way. These international students need to pay relatively higher tuition fee and other fee for school, this income can increase funding for the US universities and colleges to improve the teaching equipment, support research and increase the faculty salaries. Moreover, international students need to live their own lives beside study. This also a huge expense will promote a lot of service industries. For instance, there are Home-Stay towns in California, from where domestic families providing a home stay for the young age international students and make money in this way. And this could be the main household income for these families.  Also, international student who worked for United States after they graduated with a short term employment will not affect their long term employment to the citizen. As more and more companies can hire short term international student for their short term projects and make profits really quick. These companies dont need to provide Visa sponsorship for international student as they have enough time to work legally to finish a project. In this way, these companies can have more jobs only open to citizens. An extended OPT will change the current situation as the international students are occupying a lot of long-term job openings for citizen. \nIn a word, I support the extension of OPT period for STEM international students as this will bring profits to both sides.\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Weiyue Wang"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0700": {"commentText": "A much awaited decision gripping the lives of many international students who are willing to stay away from their homes to gain advancements in the field of study. STEM degree and jobs have been among the top luring subjects for international students to come to USA. The proposed rule to extend STEM OPT EXTENSION to 24-months will help both the students and the government. When higher education degrees are granted to other nationalities, offering jobs in the same country to put use the same valued education is the best bet for the right justice to the degree. \n\nApart from the 12-month initial OPT, getting a 24-months extension will help lot of students gain real world experience putting their degrees to the right use where they earned it. If the student decides to continue to apply the earned experience in the right channels that is within the US, applying for another work visa(H1B) would be much more feasible now. Few students struggle to get employed right after college and miss one opportunity to enter the lottery based H1B application system. Even with the most advanced degrees in the field, luck also plays a factor in getting a job or searching for the right opportunities. This 24-month extension will help students apply for H1B lottery twice(in some cases thrice) allowing them to cut down the fear of being out of status. Being unlucky does count in this sense.\n\nThe mentoring and training plan will also be a great initiative boosting employer-employee relationship in helping the company grow with the right talents. Advanced degrees are prominent in all fields now and people are leaving no stone unturned. Relevant experience also has its importance but an advanced degree provides better insight on wider growth. Releasing an official document with the participating list of companies willing to hire OPT and STEM OPT students will help majority of the students to align their interests in the right track to gain experience. Graduates with no corporate experience have a lot to gain with this training plan, where one gets to live and work in a real office with real projects and timelines for 3 years of work permit. If need be and the student decides to continue as a worker, they can apply for H1B visa or go for another advanced degree. Ability to chose another higher degree and work another 3 years on another OPT is again a stardom point in this proposed rule.\n\nI hope this proposed rule will increase the amount of full-time jobs in STEM fields, rather than the budget seeking, wavering contract jobs students are kind of forced into. If companies hire students out of college with higher degrees to be put to good use within the country it is a win-win for both of them. It would be great if the process of applying for the remaining term of extension for the already approved 17-month OPT EXTENSION be minimal and fee free.

I also believe that students currently on STEM Extensions should not be impacted if the rule does not go in place by February 12, 2016. This will cause unnecessary gaps in employment and will prove to be unnecessarily complicated for USCIS to rescind approved work authorizations. \n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2013 with a master's degree in the field of Digital Media from New York University. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \n\nIn April 2008, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued an interim final rule with request for comments that extended the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrants with a qualifying STEM degree. On August 12, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the 17-month STEM extension created by the 2008 Rule, but ordered that the vacatur be stayed until February 12, 2016. If DHS does not issue a final rule to replace the 2008 Rule, thousands of foreign students with work authorizations, such as myself, will be forced to scramble to depart the United States. This will impose a costly burden on the U.S. tech sector if thousands of young workers have to leave their jobs on February 12, 2016. \n\nForeign students represent half of all U.S. graduate enrollments in engineering, math, and computer science. There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Master's degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit. \n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers. \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy. \n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by extending the period of OPT by 17 months for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees through a new rule submitted for proper notice and comment by February 12, 2016. \n\n\nThank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSaranya Kapur", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Saranya Kapur"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0708": {"commentText": "This is a neccessary improvement to the current OPT rules and extension laws.

DHS would not have a viable argument that the company is not meeting the requirement because there are no similarly situated US workers.\n\nThe proposed rule would like to expand the program to include foreign students who obtained STEM degrees (likely outside of the US) but are in the US studying in a non-STEM program, however the extension would only be available to those who seek to develop and utilize stem skills. This seems highly irregular. Prior STEM students may not have been accepted to a US university in their STEM field due to lack of ranking or qualification of their prior university. That selfsame student might come to the US to study business or any other non-related field, and yet still be eligible for a training extension on stale or unqualified skills.\n\nThe proposed rule is particular damaging to US university students and US recent graduates in STEM fields. In the proposed rule it states that, \"hundreds of thousands of international students are currently pursuing courses of studying fields that may provide eligibility for this program\". These students are in the age bracket of 18-28. Each US high school student who intends to study must have an available position at a US university.\nThe current number of foreign students at US universities is circa 700,000. Foreign students make up about 4% of the US post-secondary school population, but the statistics are much higher at the higher ranking schools.\nThis leads to tougher competition forcing the US student into competition for a coveted place. The proposed rule is designed to encourage more foreign students to study at US universities which will only exacerbate the competition. The proposed rule damages the US university student again upon graduation, when those seeking employment in STEM fields are competing with a OPT practical trainee to whom the employer can keep in trainee status with commensurate low pay and little or no benefits for up to three years. Then comes the final blow, when the company, having the OPT completely trained and skilled in the job after three years decides to obtain an H1B or E-visa for that person rather than hiring on the market. The US university student lost both on the initial job opportunity, the training and then the long term job.\n", "confidence": "67.9027", "result": "Negative", "author": "Veronica Hensler"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0096": {"commentText": "This would be a great opportunity for all the F1 students to serve the United States, the land which has given a very good quality higher education for all the international students.\nI would request the Govt. to please pass this rule for all the students who are already in OPT extension and who are applying for it and the future applicants too.", "confidence": "99.2890", "result": "Positive", "author": "Vikram Tej"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2708": {"commentText": "I was a computer science professor in the U.S. from 1983 to 2014.

I believe it should be extended to 24 months. The extension would be beneficial to all that are involved, which are; the students, U.S. employers, the economic sector, and the educational system. If this proposed extension becomes successful, STEM students would gain more experience during their OPT period due to the additional time. STEM students are limited to a time period of seventeen months to achieve both theoretical and practical knowledge in their specified fields. Time extension would be beneficial to the students in that they will be knowledgeably equipped to practice in their home countries. Also, this would give them more time to spend with their families, and the numerous friends they have made over the years. \nFurthermore, the extension would also be beneficial to the U.S. employers. This is because, majority of international students that come to the U.S. to study are in the STEM fields. STEM students tend to provide valuable skills to employers. In an educational research article by Neil Ruiz, he pointed out that \"collectively the STEM fields accounted for 37 percent of all F-1 visa approvals, compared to 27 percent overall\". \nhttp://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/geography-of-foreign-students#/M10420 . Employers benefit a lot from the skills of STEM OPT students. Some opposing arguments suggest that giving STEM OPT students more time to work in the U.S. will displace American workers. This argument can be countered because it is illegal for an employer to terminate or layoff any eligible U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to an F-1 student. \nAlso, STEM students contribute to the United States economy by providing assistance to scientific research professionals. They use their skills to develop new technologies which are used in different institutions in the country, and they also help to improve existing technologies. All these are beneficial to the U.S. economy. Allowing them more time to explore in their different fields would give them more time to give back to the country that has impacted so much knowledge in them. \nIn addition, this will also benefit the U.S. educational system by attracting more international students to the STEM field. People back home would feel more encouraged to come study in the U.S. because they believe they would be given quality opportunity to learn and explore. This in turn would benefit the U.S. educational system by pumping more money into the system. I was an international student, and I know how much I spent out of pocket in the course of my undergraduate education. My family back home was willing to invest all that money in me because they wanted me to get the best education. International students pay all their tuition out of pocket. An international student's tuition for just a semester would cover a U.S. citizen's tuition for at least two years in college. International students contribute hugely to the educational system, not just by bringing in their diverse cultures to spice up things for the American students, but also they financially assist in the continuous growth of the school system. Hence, if their needs are not met, that would be so discouraging to the ones back home who have the intention of coming to America to study. \nIn an article by NAFSA, it was noted that \"886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during 2013-2014 academic year\". \nhttp://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, every year I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting.The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers.  \nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest technologies in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months \nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals.Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\nConclusion \nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

As a tax paying American citizen, I object to the expansion of this program.  I can see the rationale of giving foreign students the opportunity to apply the training they have acquired at U.S. institutions of higher learning so that our nation may profit from the investment made into these students' lives.  What is extremely objectionable to me is that it is being used to hinder American citizens who have paid dearly for training believing that they would find jobs in the U.S. to offset the cost of their education and enable them to provide livelihood for themselves and their families, keeping them off welfare and other assistance programs that drain resources from the tax paying citizens of this nation.  I have seen statistics showing that in a four year period, over 400,000 American citizens have been denied jobs in favor of hiring foreign students under the OPT program.  That is unconscionable!  Our first duty is to the needs of our own citizens, particularly in a time of severe economic downturn resulting in thousands of Americans being laid off work.  DHS is actually proposing to give financial incentives to employers who hire foreign students over Americans.  It should be the other way around in an environment in which Americans cannot even take care of their own financial responsibilities.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have also been informed that OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

The decision is ultimately in the hands of the DHS, but it is the moral responsibility of this department of a government \"OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE\" to consider the ramifications of such an act on the very people whose rights this nation's government has a responsibility to protect.

Immigrants are in almost every leading industry of America, from Silicon Valley to Hollywood, from sports to Wall Street. \n\nBringing the greatest minds, regardless of where they are from. America's openness and freedom in technology towards most talented people over the world, is one important factor that this country has become, and is maintaining the leader of the world for science and technology. First railway, first computer, first atomic bomb, first moon landing... foreigners are behind every influential projects of this country, making their contributions. America has selected them, and they have selected to become American.\n\nForeigners are making contribution to America's STEM industry. Many talented people in STEM fields are not born in this country. Elon Musk, founder of Uber, is from South Africa. CEO of Google and Microsoft are from India. One founder of Garmin GPS is from Taiwan. Even though a large percentage of talented founders and senior managers of outstanding companies are Americans, many of them are still born and raised in immigrant families. The intelligence reserve is a significant factor of core competence for a nation. If we are thinking of this country's future, it is better to attract more smart, foreign students to work and live in United States.\n\nMany Americans are concerned, about the competition of foreign workers brings to local job market. I would like to say, based on my own experience in job seeking, foreign students confront much more restriction and limitation. When applying for technical roles, we face a much higher hiring bar. Almost all tech-related jobs that are filled by foreign students are because of the real need in the market that can not be filled with local students. As an example of IT industry, Facebook, Google, Apple, Uber all have launched recruitment in China and India, giving direct sponsorship for selected employee in those countries. Sponsorship is not cheap, companies are willing to pay more, simply because the companies believe those employees are smarter, deliver better work and better fit for the opportunities and roles. We are not simply taking the jobs away, we are creating jobs and making a better future.\n\nThe need is there, and we need to solve it. That is why we need the OPT extension.\n\nIt is true that there are some companies that targeting the current loopholes and filing more H1b applications for oversea workers, paying them at a low wage. American people blame them for taking jobs away. Yes but that is totally different from the OPT extension we are discussing. Realistically, if OPT extension is revoked, tens of thousands of foreign employees will be forced to leave after just a year of their starting date, and companies are forced to launch new recruiting process. This brings economic harm to those companies. More adversely, those companies will hesitate when they hire foreign new-grads next time. But since the need is still there, there will still be gap of smart workers in STEM fields. \n\nI watched the republican presidential candidate debate not too long ago. One of them raised a point which I can't agree more. \"Ironically, America might be the only country which it is controversial to say 'secure the border'.\" In my opinion, what is more ironic is that America is friendly to those undocumented immigrants with no jobs or low-end jobs, but is taking away STEM-related workers who are not only decent tax payers, but also real future value creators for the country.\n\nTherefore, for the bright future, and for the justice and equal opportunity of all people in this country, please pass the OPT-extension rule!", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Jiaju Shen, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2143": {"commentText": "If a company is hiring people by making use of their skills that were built during the school, then since foreign students also developed the skill sets that can be valuable for the company, they should have the same working opportunities.

We can easily imagine using statistics to improve health care services, or using computer technology to facilitate children's academic achievement. To accomplish such goals, we need experts who have knowledge not only in statistics or programming, but also in non-STEM areas like health care or education. However, under the previous OPT extension policy, international students who have already obtained STEM degrees would only have a very limited period of OPT if they want to pursue a second degree in non-STEM areas and work in such STEM-related but interdisciplinary fields. If they are allowed to use the previously obtained STEM degree for their OPT extension, it would be great support to their career development. \n\n\nIn addition, such a new policy would encourage international STEM students to apply their STEM knowledge to various fields in our life, rather than to stick with the very traditional STEM fields. Therefore, the traditional STEM fields will not be overcrowded with foreigners, and the interdisciplinary fields can advance with more STEM experts. Since the new policy requires the job to be related with the previously obtained STEM degree, these students will not take up employment opportunity of US-citizens in STEM-unrelated areas. The policy will be beneficial to the international students, the US economy, and the life quality/employment opportunity of the US-citizens.\n\n\n2) Deciding whether a student really majors in STEM is sometimes more difficult and complex than just looking at their I-20. The same type of program may be assigned with different CIP codes in different schools, sometimes STEM and sometimes non-STEM. For example, in developmental psychology programs (which is a STEM area), students in some schools are listed on their I-20 as majoring in STEM fields of \"child/developmental psychology\" or \"experimental psychology\", and thus considered as STEM students; however, students in other schools may have \"general psychology\", \"education\", or \"human development\" on their I-20, therefore unable to apply for the OPT extension. But in reality, these developmental psychology programs coded as non-STEM do not differ at all from those coded as STEM-related in their coursework and research. The difference in the codes is not due to the nature of the program, but a result of school bureaucracy. Therefore, dividing developmental psychology students into STEM and non-STEM and deciding their eligibility for OPT extension simply based on their most recent degree would be unfair and ignorant of the complexity in reality. Such problems do not only occur in psychology, but also in other disciplines. While it is difficult to change the STEM major categories, with the new policy, students who continuously obtained two or more degrees in the same discipline will be considered as STEM students if one of the programs are coded as STEM. This new policy will improve employment equality of students within the same discipline. \n\n\nAlternatively, to ensure employment equality, DHS should allow students who are categorized as non-STEM majors to apply for the STEM OPT extension if the students can prove that their coursework and thesis/dissertation topic can fulfill the requirements of another program that is coded as STEM.", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Danming An"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0551": {"commentText": "I fully support this new rule.

I got my masters degree in Engineering from a large public university. I learnt a great deal during my schooling in the US and had the good fortune to be taught by world renowned scientists. \n\nI remember towards the end of my degree, I along with few other grad students and post-docs were attending a meeting to review recent research results from a visiting professors lab. We had unending questions about the results and were politely but relentlessly questioning the visiting professor. My professor proudly pointed to us and said to the visiting professor \"look at how critical these young researchers are of the material you presented, they don't accept the material at face value and have learned to think like scientists\". I realized at that moment that slowly, without even realizing it, under the careful, critical and tireless tutelage of my professors, my mind had finally opened and begun to process information like a scientists' should. \n\nAfter graduating, I applied for the OPT visa and started working at a company that manufactures very complex scientific equipment. My master's thesis was based on this equipment and this role provided me the opportunity to understand more about the physics, applications and inner workings of this technology. \n\nI know for a fact that I had not displaced any US citizens by taking up my current job and this position was open for months before I applied and was hired. \n\nMy educational background, engineering skills and aptitude have proven to be very valuable for the company I work for and I have been a highly contributing employee thus far.  I have had very supportive and experienced mentors who have continuously trained and guided me. I have learnt more working alongside my fellow engineers than I could have learnt in a university setting. \n\nMoreover many of the soft skills that I picked up at my job are the foundation of having a successful lifelong career in engineering. I learned to apply my skills in an environment where teamwork, dealing with customers, collaborators and outside competition was just as important as getting the right answers. \n\nHaving the 12 months OPT and 24 months STEM extension in my opinion is absolutely crucial for engineering roles where technologies evolve so quickly that what is learned in universities is outdated by the time we graduate. \n\nInternships do help in getting some practical experience but to become an effective engineer we need to be involved in developing enterprise scale projects which take years of continuous effort. Internships generally provide opportunities to work on small projects that can be completed in 3-6 months.\n\nUnfortunately my 17 month OPT period ends in mid-December and it seems unlikely that the 24 month STEM extension rule would be finalized before then. \n\nI urge you to please consider allowing students who have recently completed their 17 month STEM extension and are currently in their 60 day grace period to apply for the balance 7 months extension. \n\nThough I have learnt a great deal about one instrument, my training is still incomplete and I have not even begun to get trained on the highly complex equipment we supply to synchrotron labs around the world.

It would help US continuously have a very good number of high quality international employees, who have been significantly contributing on the growth of economy (especially on high tech branch) in the States since years ago. Otherwise, the Companies would lose thousands of international employees next year, which would be a tremendous disaster for their operation and growth, especially for small business. Since there may not be enough qualified domestic candidates to hire in such a short time, as a result, not having this OPT extension may put the whole economy system in danger here in the States.\n\n2. United States of America, as we all know, is one of the most developed and most civilized countries in the world; not only because of  the right path those national fathers created a couple hundreds years ago, but also the spirits and values of this country Freedom, Justice and Diversity that built gradually generation by generation, which exactly is what their citizens are proud of. When I first came to the States, the director of the international office in my school, told me something like this: \"This country is strong as a thick rope, because she has been joined and being reinforced by high quality small ropes from different corners of the world. Therefore, we believe that the States will be as strong as they are with many high quality international components in the future.\n\n3. More working experiences for international students can be beneficial for both side: the students would get trained more and learn more skill before they head back their own country, which makes them more competitive to better contribute what they could and pursue what they are eager to for their life. On the other hand,  when they are back home, their \"USA\" working experiences can enhance business tie with USA when there is any business going on.\n\n4. With OPT extension, international student may be able to put what they have designed or developed into the market, create a startup, which may bring potential jobs in the near future.\n\nFor people like me,\n\nMy wife is currently an information architect at one of IT companies here in the States. Myself is a software engineer, just got my full time job offer and will start my work soon here. Without OPT extension, I only have one chance to try to win \"H1B lottery\"; if I am not getting it, I will lose my job after 12 months OPT. As a results, the whole burden will be put on my wife's shoulder to support the whole family, which will be too hard for her. Of course we can leave USA and head back home in that case, that way we both would have a job. But that decision can't not be made by myself, which is also too hard for both of us. Therefore, this OPT extension will be so important for us because with that, I may have 3 chances to get a H1B Visa. Also, a lot of things could be figured out with 24 more months.\n\nFrom my point of view, This OPT extension, will be surely beneficial for me, for people like me, but more importantly, for the whole country in both short and long run.\n\n\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Xiaoqin LI, Rice University"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2451": {"commentText": "I fully support 24 months stem extension instead of 17 months .

Those people who are eligible for OPT extension are highly educated and well trained people in high tech area. The offer of job already proved the ability of these candidates. A lot of people will leave without the extension because they may not be able to get H-1B too. They will find a place in other countries to develop their career and contribute their wisdom. That means the US loses talents and other competitor gets. It may not impact the position of America immediately, but its predictable that there is negative impact to America in long term.\n\n\nAnother party which would be helped by this proposal is employers. A lot of high tech companies have very diverse employees, and a part of them are students who have master or PHD degree  in F-1 OPT status. The company usually chooses employee with its strict criteria. A typical employee process has to go through HR, financial, Hiring Team etc departments, and to through advertisement, phone screen(a lot), phone interview(a lot), then on-site interview(a few) steps. It usually takes months to settle down one position. A tons of money and effort are spent for every hiring. In addition, companies need continue spend money and effort to train new employees to let them adapt to the environment. However, the company will lose the OPT employee very soon because the employee may not have working permission. How painful it is! Yes, employers wont have this problem if they simply dont hire F-1 Nonimmigrant students. Unfortunately, because of the criteria of the job position, its not easy to find qualified candidates. This OPT extension proposal will release the pain for employers, as there is enough time to help their employees settle down and keep improving and contribute themselves.\n\n\nThe last but not the least party is individual.

There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions.

Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Masters degree, or above, at a U.S. university.

The following are but a few. \n\nIII. Executive Summary\nA. Purpose of the Regulatory Action\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school  thus, the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. In short, every and any school is a qualifying school.   Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.  \n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months, which is nobodys definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself  48 months is the course of study.  A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B  thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker  WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of [] employment.  Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students. \n[NOTE: U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.] \n\nG. Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields. \nTo guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. This is deceptive. The Regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S. worker. The Regulation deflect the issue away from  this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world.  Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers  with  no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student. \n \nThe Regulations define  similarly situated as \nU.S. workers in other employers [not other employees of the same employer] of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area [which will be strictly construed] of employment. Similarly situated U.S. workers would include U.S. workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the STEM OPT student.\nIn Short  By Definition There Are No Similarly Situated U.S. Workers Ensuring That No One Will Meet This Definition So The Employer Can Never Be Liable For Replacing Any U.S. Worker.\n\nIn addition an employer is to monitor and record his own actions by attestation in the Mentoring and Training Plan. This Regulation is designed to harm U.S. workers because it leaves the  FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE.]  The employer would also be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.\nThis Regulation is designed to leave the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers thus, giving the employer an excuse/alibi to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign student.  \n", "confidence": "99.9549", "result": "Positive", "author": "James Otto"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1395": {"commentText": "i think its necessary to extend to 36 months,as many international people invest a lot of tuition fee,will be good thing if you extend,as it will useful in returning the invested money, as always it gonna be economically benefit to USA.", "confidence": "58.4633", "result": "Neutral", "author": "Karthik Rahul"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1392": {"commentText": "It is a very welcome move by DHS to reinstate the STEM OPT extension rule and further revise it for 24 months.

Below are facts that need to be considered and answered before this proposed rule is re-reviewed.   \n\nINFORMATION FOR REVIEW:\nA Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\n    OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\n    OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n    \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\n    the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n    \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS:\nI am disappointed that my own government and my own citizens would consider such a rule that undermines the American dream, greatness and worse of all, its' own citizen.\n\nThis rule should not be considered.

US being one of the world's leader in research and development, the students get an firsthand experience on the emerging technology. The section 'Benefits of International Students in the United States' clearly states that international students have directly contributed to the economy of US via tuition and their contribution to the emerging technologies. The 24 month STEM extension proposal in place for the vacated 17 month extension would encourage more international students coming into the country for better education thus contributing directly to the economy. \n\nThe Mentoring and Training Plan outlined will definitely clear any doubts that people had in the 17 month extension. Through this new plan students get trained in the field of their STEM degree and also help the employer in drafting a plan that can effectively utilize their potential. I hope all doubters of the 17 month extension welcome this idea as the employer would clearly define the nature of job and the impact a STEM graduate's skill can make to the company's growth and the US economy.\n\nAlso I agree with the statement that the projects STEM students are involved in their workplace are generally long and goes for more than 2 years. These projects impact a company's goals and losing a STEM graduate working on a critical project can hurt the company. I work in a technology environment and I have seen projects go on for a long period of time as it involves many stakeholders with different ideas and perspectives.

The products I develop helps millions of people across the world including American citizens. \n\nMedical devices is a highly regulated industry and often it takes couple of years to successfully launch a product.

The best source of that skilled workforce is the foreign nationals educated in the US universities. \n\nThe U.S. job market is not a \"zero-sum game\" in which workers must fight each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has the most dynamic and powerful economy the world has ever known, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked shoulder to shoulder with native-born workers to build it.\n\nThe overwhelming weight of research shows that in our dynamic labor market, skilled immigrants complement their U.S.-born counterparts. Skilled immigrants' help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign workers positively impact the wages and employment opportunities of native-born workers across our economy.\n\nThe important role that skilled immigrants play in our economy extends far beyond the world of computers and high tech, and skilled immigrants are helping to reshape communities far beyond Silicon Valley. They are making enormous contributions in almost every aspect of our economy, including manufacturing, medical research, healthcare delivery, and agriculture. Their contributions have helped rebuild economies in places like Des Moines, Iowa; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nFor me, the bottom line is this:\n\nIn today's global economy, where other countries are spending billions of dollars to compete with America's ability to attract immigrants, we cannot take this issue for granted. If we continue to ignore the need for immigration reform or adopt policies that discourage skilled immigrants from helping America to innovate, lead, and create more high-paying jobs we run the enormous risk that America will be left behind, without a robust innovation and entrepreneurial sector.\n\nInnovation is the key to growing the U.S. economy and creating jobs. In turn, the key to innovation is attracting, growing, and retaining a skilled workforce. Foreign-born workers, especially STEM workers, have been and will continue to be a critical part of this equation.\n\nThe policies, similar to this proposed rule, will help us fulfill the promise of an immigration system that serves a 21st century, global economy, while protecting the rights and promoting opportunities for all workers.\n\nResearch supports the creation of a revamped and revitalized immigration system with updated visa caps and the elimination of per-country quotas; a system that retains talented individuals who were educated in the United States. We need a system that supports STEM education right here at home; a system that encourages compliance with rules and safeguards against exploitation and abuse; and that allows for more flexibility, predictability, and consistency.\n\nThe good news is that these reforms are achievable, and that lasting immigration reform is within our reach. The key to success is to not pursue these issues in isolation. Maximizing the economic contributions of skilled immigrants is important work, but it is only one component of the broad based reforms our system desperately needs. We must realize that immigrant job creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators come in all shapes and sizes. They come to our shores not only through employment-based channels but through family reunification and as refugees and asylees. They can also be found within the population of unauthorized workers.\n\nThe importance of reforming our systemall aspects of itto further our prosperity cannot be overstated.

Below are some of the reasons why:\n\n    The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n   It Gives employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n    OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n      Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said (in a letter to President Obama):\n     \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n    The proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n    \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n    \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n    \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n      John Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n      the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n    \"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n      Richard Trumpka, President of the AFL-CIO:\n     \"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n    \"In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.\"\n\n      David North, formerly of the U.S. Labor Department:\n      \"there is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n    \"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n    \"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n   \n      Ron Hira of Howard University:\n     \"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional.

As is known that US is the home for most elite IT companies and plays a leading role in technology innovation. As a OPT student, one will be able to work longer in the US and get better prepared for his/her career in his/her own country. Many students who plan to work in US for 2 or 3 years do not need to rely on H1B visa if they are able to work in OPT status for 3 years, and this will largely relieve the H1B visa tension. Since most of the students want to gain work experience and go back to their own country after 2 or 3 years, holding an H1B visa will be a waste because they will not use up the years. Thus, extending OPT rather than offering H1B is a better way to provide a legal work status for these students.\n\nSecond, the fast growing of IT industry is short of STEM talents, and will definitely be demanding more, especially talent new grads. OPT students have contributed a lot to the success of big IT companies, like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc, and these companies make a better life for us. Talents are the heart of these companies and the heart of future innovation, where US, as the world IT industry leader, definitely wants to play a big role.

Some people argue that these students will take their jobs in the future, but this is not true. Actually, these OPT students will help expand the industry and thus creating more jobs. Look at those startups, a lot of them are created by foreign talented students or have these students working hard during their growth.

The US is my home and where I was raised but now my entire world is in jeopardy because STEM OPT may or may not exist in the next few months. If you dont approve this rule, I, an American in spirit, would have to leave my home. \n\nIm the eldest of my family and serve as integral support and principal earner. If I were to leave, my family would be left in crisis. I have a brother in med school, a mortgage to pay, and two car payments. The loss of my income would be crippling. \n\nNow, you may not care for one random contributing member of your society but I represent thousands in the same position. So many would suffer. Large companies or small and too many individuals to count. Major companies would have to retrain thousands at the cost of possibly millions. Smaller companies (such as mine) would lose valuable members that contribute and push small businesses forward. You would cut off those who willingly and eagerly contribute to the life blood of the American dream. This rule carries economic significance for the immigrant and nonimmigrant alike. \n\nAmerica is a land of immigrants, you know that.

On the one hand the DHS is doing right by those concerned about American jobs but they may not be doing right by themselves. Providing mentorship programs is a good idea on paper but who on earth is going to process them all? And wont adding something else to approve delay STEM OPT approvals even more? Ive waited nearly 3 months for my own already and adding a mentorship program to that would only increase wait times. Delays are to be expected but grace periods and additional cap-gap policies would need to be written to accommodate for the new requirements. Would people need to apply 6 months ahead of time instead of 3? What happens to those within their 60 day grace periods before OPT begins? \n\nWith regards to the expansion of the extension to 24 months, I approve. It is a more reasonable number and allows a student to contribute to a company for a less arbitrary amount of time. An employer knows that their qualified and eligible employee will be available for a full 2 years after initial OPT. My current pending application will likely be processed as a 17 month extension but I appreciate that I can apply for the remaining available months. My only concern is how much it will cost to apply.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\n \n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n \n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\n \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\n \n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\n \n\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\n \n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

It helps lot of Indian INC companies i.e. companies with CEO'S mainly Indians to find an illegal way to cheat the system and i would like to tell you how and what is happening currently with lot of OPT students at least to 60% of students that are being currently recruited and placed. Please read it and understand the cheating that's happening right now: 1. The consultancy recruits OPT students by a simple process without an interview either by cold calling or by referrals and almost every company has a guest house where students are being accommodated providing food and shelter for a short period of time until they gets placed(yes i am referring to placed because even though you are recruited by the company you will be never paid until you get a contract job with client - as OPT have a rule that they can be given unpaid training every consultancy says that it is legal);. Upto this there is no big fraud or cheating that happening with the system from next step everything is illegal, unethical and unlawful.2. In the meanwhile he will be asked what kind of technology he is interested in and the consultancy will give guidance as in which technology has good job market billing rate and how he can easily get a job, will the job be easy or hard with fake experience etc. so then according to the nature the consultant/student selects the technology and consultancy will give training to consultant form then. Note: Please understand that the term training that i referred is not exact training way they will give to consultants/students. The trainer teaches basic concepts in technology and will mainly train he/she to how to survive in the job with 8-10 years of fake experience and will assure consultants that he will be taking the phone interview call for the consultant/student and will also makes a deal that he will be providing job support during consultant job which is unethical i.e. student after his office or during his office will either screen share or will be communicating his office work with trainer there by breaking the office confidentiality code. Trainer does the work for him according to consultant inputs for initial days until the consultant learns his work in his office. For this the trainer or the job backup will be paid hourly or monthly by the consultant. 2. Every consultant who have been hired in OPT will be given a sample fake resume after his training which has atleast 8-10 YEARS of experience to give him an idea how an experienced resume looks like and will be advised to make a resume that shall look like a sample fake resume that has been given to consultant. 3. The consultant/student in OPT agrees to it and then prepares a resume with fake resume which includes client names and company names, years that he has worked which in reality he has never worked on. Then the client names the he puts on the resume is carefully reviewed by consultancy and consultancy will make sure that at least first 2 clients that they put have some body in the client's location either full time or contractor that consultancy knows. The reason for that is to provide job reference when client recruiter asks about reference from his previous jobs  4. Then after the resume is prepared with fake years of experience with fake clients they which here the consultancy markets the resume with their marketing team with fake resumes. Thus the fake resume goes into markets with the consultant details and google voice number almost all the consultants will be advised to have a google voice number in their resume instead of personal numbers which is left to you to decide for what they are doing like that 5.So then the fake resume goes to a prime vendor where the vendor calls the consultant  to verify his job responsibilities, so now the consultant will be well prepared with his fake resume as in how to speak when a vendor calls, so when the vendor calls the consultant the consultant will keep his fake resume in front and talks to him in that fake resume way. Then if the vendor feels good in the phone then he will forward that to main client recruiter/manager. 6. So this is the main step, so when consultant gets the interview confirmation with client manager he then calls his back up or calls his consultancy to arrange a backup. So if it is a phone interview then the consultant will put a call forwarding to the backup resource who will be taking the call for the consultancy thus inviting unethical activity. SO the consultant will forward his fake resume and details to back up so that back up will speak to client manager accordingly and thus gets paid if the consultant gets a job after the interview call as he helped consultant which will be paid by consultancy. Then the consultant if selected will be sent to that client\n", "confidence": "99.9988", "result": "Positive", "author": "Suresh Naresh"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2868": {"commentText": "I completely support the OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months.

Most obvious thing - If an international student and a US citizen file a job application with similar skills, the US citizen will be given priority. So there is no point of worrying about the jobs here. More over the international students are looking fro jobs in STEM field and there are plenty other fields where US citizens can look for jobs. \n\nAlso we are paying too much tuition fees as well.

DHS had a real opportunity to reform the OPT program to give a fair treatment to American workers with this rule, but the proposed rule falls short in several areas that I listed below -\n\n1. The biggest weakness of the OPT program has always been that its a subsidy for employers as they are exempt from FICA taxes, which can result in substantial savings for employers over long term. This makes them tacitly discriminate against American works. This rule does nothing to address this shortcoming. The rule should change to make the employers pay the FICA taxes when hiring OPT students\n\n2. The provisions to make sure employers paying the OPT workers same wage as American workers are quite weak. I have worked with OPT workers in my previous jobs. Most of these workers are under a lot of pressure to obtain H1b visas from their current employer. So, they work for any kind of wages as long as the employer is willing to sponsor them a H1b visa. The only way to enforce this is to modify the rule to make sure the employers submit a Labor condition application to certify that they are going to pay the OPT student the current prevailing wage.\n\n3. The duration for which the OPT student is allowed to work in most cases will be substantially longer than the time the F-1 student spends in school. Most of the F-1 students coming in STEM fields come to study Masters degrees in US universities, which in most cases take around 1 year to 1.5 year to complete. It does not make any sense to let these students do an internship for 3 years, given that most of them did a 1 year course. It would make a little more sense to give Phd grads 3 years of work permit, but for Masters grad its just a completely illogical thing to do. So, the rule should be modified to give the 3 years OPT only to Phd grads, or to Master's grads who study for more than 2 years\n\n4. The OPT rule's Mentoring and Training plan is a decent provision to make sure the student is sticking to his field of study. But again, how is this enforced? Does DHS have funds to do onsite audits of OPT program, given that DHS is not charging any additional fees for it on OPT application? Where is the money to do the audits coming from? \n\nThanks again for your time and consideration.

Occasionally, I see some worries regarding the impact of this rule to U.S. born STEM workers. \n\nIn my opinion, these worries are unfounded.\n\nI work for a public tech company. Our company promised the STEM graduates, mostly highly skilled Ph.D. degree holders, who are affect by the Aug WashTech ruling, to keep the same position and relocate to our Canada office. The reason is simple: the cost of replacing them is too high. \n\nI believe that similar arrangements will be made in other tech companies as well. In most STEM fields, the employees can work remotely. And most of STEM employers are international companies with oversea offices. The vacation of the OPT STEM extension will not necessarily mean that these jobs will go to U.S. born STEM workers, but rather rob this country of these young, high-earning, tax-paying,highly skilled workers (who will still hold these jobs) but live in a foreign country.\n\nThe argument that the companies hire international STEM majors because they are cheaper also doesn't have any supporting evidence. In fact, in most tech company's recruitment workflow, the party who makes the hiring decision (the tech lead or manager) and the party who negotiate salary (the HR) work separately. When the hiring decision is made, the salary negotiation hasn't started yet. It is impossible to discriminate against U.S. born STEM majors due to salary differences.\n\nIt will be beneficial, rather than harmful, to U.S. born STEM workers if we are able to attract highly skilled international STEM majors to stay in U.S. The main complaint against this rule is the U.S. born STEM workers' fear of competition. However, it is the rule of the market that improvements and innovation stem from competition. The competition in technology will not go away just because the U.S. workers are fearful. It will instead happen in other countries, and create even more incentives for U.S. tech companies to establish oversea centers and to outsource. The biggest beneficiaries of the Aug WashTech ruling would be China and India.\n\nIn addition, the Aug WashTech ruling is particularly unfair for the STEM major students graduated from 2013 to 2015. Upon graduation, they planned their living arrangements and career based on the STEM extension policy. The sudden change of the ruling invalidates their prior plannings, which can easily result in tens of thousands dollars of additional costs for them.\n\nPassing this new rule as is, will be a win-win for both the US and the US STEM workers. \n\n\n\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Anonymous"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2615": {"commentText": "STEM fields are what the government needs to pushing the nation forward.

Some foreigners couldn't meet deadlines, and when asked questions about deadlines or get fired they would magically appear with the software code in a few days time>  The software code the foreign workers couldn't explain how it worked.

Look at new  Engineering graduates, where's the jobs???  Where are these working.   Instead of American workers at job site you might walk down the halls of engineering firms and see cubicles are filled with foreign workers because of high incentives to employers paid by the government. low wages to employee and lots of help from American Engineer. Low wages and frequent layoffs for American Engineer is what the foregn worker brings us.

The Regulation deflect the issue away from this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world. Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student\".\n\nThis logic is flawed, when a student is employed by a company, he/she is an employee and will be judged in the same category as US workers. There is no \"apple vs orange\" comparison. Also, if a similarly situated US worker is not found, that exactly proves the student's skills are very in need and this should further qualify his/her employment. Also, as an international student working in US worker, I have at least three US colleagues that perform similar work as I did and earn similar salaries as I do. Saying \"no similarly situated  US worker can be found\" is very wrong\n\n2)Secondly, I have question about the mentoring program:\n\n For the mentoring program, there should be better guidelines about what it is. what kind of document shall  be submitted? is there any difference between the mentoring program and a working plan for an employee? Is it practical or meaningful to have such a mentoring program? As an employee in US company, we know that employees should be proactive.

The following are but a few. \n\n\nD. Mentoring and Training Plan\nThe Regulation does not care if the student is taught anything at all because the Regulation leaves it to the UNTRAINED employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for STEM OPT students.  The employer is in business  not education.  \nIt Is Noted That The Regulation Does Not Refute That The U.S. Has Plenty Of Home Grown Scholars And Stem Student. \nThe Regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign student. In stead, the Regulation leaves it to the imagination of the employer DHS anticipates that employers have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices. Of course, the ambiguous lanague is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law.   \n\nThe Regulation failed to mention the most obvious documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers are the employers payroll and personal records. What an employer is paying his current employees is direct and relevant evidence of how and what the employer values competent work.  In stead, the Regulations allows the employer to hide the documents that it actually relies on and use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys, to set compensation for their U.S. workers.  In short, the Regulations allow the employer and DHS to ignore reality (I.e. what is actually happening) ad substitute fantasy (i.e. what the employer and DHS hope is happening.) \n\nThe Regulations describe employers hiring high skilled STEM OPT students, thus accepting as fact that foreign students are already highly skilled in spite of the reality that the Regulations have already stated that the need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced  foreign student. \n\nFurther, the Regulations would not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business but, in stead, would open such definitions to the world by provid[ing] the Department of Labors Office of Foreign Labor Certification.  \n\nThe Regulations fail to protect U.S. workers because the Regualtions fail to gage the wages of U.S. workers. In stead, the Regualtions help ONLY the imported foreign students in gauge[ing] compliance, employers would be required to provide DHS with student compensation information, which would better situate the agency to monitor whether STEM OPT students are being compensated fairly. \n\nIf the DHS cared to protect the U.S. worker, then, the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its U.S. employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any U.S. EMPLOYEE. That would protect the U.S. worker. \n\nThe regulation provide for on site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should/must conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet BOTH the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S. workers is in any way adversely impacted.  Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the  PAST FIVE (5) YEARS WITH NAMES, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS. \n\nThe Regualtions fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regualtions or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers.  The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.   \n\nFinally, the Regualtions fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regualtions. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regualtion, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for  fraud leaves the victimized American still goes without proper compensation.] \n\nOf course, the message form this Regualtion is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.   \n\n", "confidence": "86.4300", "result": "Negative", "author": "James Otto (2nd Comment)"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1401": {"commentText": "I would like to express my support for DHS for proposing this new rule.

The STEM OPT Extension is primarily used by foreign \"nonimmigrant\" students that come in large numbers to the USA to pursue higher education in STEM areas. These students pay out-of-state fees here to go to school and thus bring in higher revenues to the universities here. Doing away with the STEM OPT Extension or even reducing it any lesser than what it originally was (17 months) may prevent these students from choosing USA as their choice of destination for STEM related higher education and thus decrease the revenue for the Universities here. This decrease in revenue is going to negatively impact teacher salaries, research grants, critical infrastructure development, etc.\n2. Most foreign students that pursue higher education in STEM areas, end up working for science and technology companies here in the USA. These students contribute towards growing these businesses which in turn helps the economy. These students also directly help the economy by paying taxes, social security, medicare and so on. Reducing the STEM OPT extension is going to negatively impact all these areas.\n3.

With this extension, US universities and colleges would be much more likely to attract international students, each of whom would spend averagely 25000 dollars on tuition a year in US. Besides, they would also have extra spending on living, shopping, and renting. This kind of spending would stimulate the growth of US economy, not to mention that they would bring relatives to come to US to visit and shop. This adds to the revenue of US touring business and sales business. If there is no benefits like OPT, international students might tend to choose Australia, Canada, New Zealand etc which have better regulations for international students, and they would probably obtain the revenue which could have been gained by US.\n2. This extension would also benefit companies which are in need of selected IT professionals. As the IT industry grows enormously in US, almost all the companies have evolved, and need at least web support. However, the H1B capital has not increased. There exists lots of arguments on whether the number of US STEM students is more than the number of STEM jobs, and this subject, in my opinion, bears little relevance on whether OPT should be granted to foreigners since the ratio ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 in various studies.\nFirst, even the number is larger than that of job postings, it does not mean that the company needs are satisfied. In STEM field, quality is at a lot of occasions more important than quantity. That is to say, companies choose candidates based more on their qualifications, and lots of unqualified candidates is worse than a few qualified candidates. It is not to say that US STEM students are not competent, but they are not all that competent and companies do not have to bear with it.\nSecond, many STEM students ended up working outside STEM fields. After years in STEM, those students find more suitable career paths. So the number of degrees earned does not mean the actual work force.\nThird, companies which choose international students are mostly focusing on international strategies. They truly need people from different areas of the world, and they need the best, not in US, but internationally. Choosing the best people in the world would mean that they can be the best companies in the world. Otherwise, they would not necessarily be the best. Therefore, OPT extension simply provides companies more choices, and if they do wish, they can always choose citizens.\nFourth, companies have every intention to make money. Hiring foreigners means that they have to go through legal procedures, which is costly. If citizens would do the work, they have no need to hire foreigners. It also rebuts the claim that foreign workers are cheap so they are hired.\n3.This extension also bears moral and humanistic meanings. As we are all aware, the former OPT regulation is becoming obsolete in February 2016. However, lots of graduate students have already obtained permission from DHS to work longer than February 2016. If this extension does not pass, it means next February millions of students have to leave because US changes its mind.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \nI was glad to see the proposed rule for re instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. \nThe proposal to re institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. \nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. \nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 36-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 48 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nEstablishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience. \nOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period. \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new immediately.

I am currently on the OPT STEM Extension which was vacated recently effective 02/12/2016. Our first attempt to obtain an H-1B visa in 2015 was unsuccessful due to the limited availability via lottery. Without the availability of a STEM extension, I will need to leave the United States immediately post 02/12/2016 and take my specialized knowledge to another country. \n \nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the following reasons.\n1.\tThe STEM extension period will provide me valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates can not only gain real-world knowledge in the chosen industry but will also be a great opportunity to practice the knowledge gained during the course of the Ph.D research funded by federal grants. \n2.\tThe additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network not just within the country but also internationally which will benefit the scientific output in the U.S. \n3.\tThese benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies and educational institutions to remain competitive globally.   \n4.\tIn the absence of such a program, STEM students with advanced degrees will be forced to leave the country if their H-1B visa application is not successful and will take their specialized knowledge to competing countries with more inviting immigration rules which will be a huge loss to the U.S. economy. \n5.     STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n6.\tExpanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in many industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus.

Students with specialized knowledge like mine should be granted up to 36 months of practical training which will enable them to work on more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n \n2.\tOptions to Address Pending Applications and Students Already Granted a 17-Month Extension in case of a vacatur. The following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT\n(i)\tAny student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. \n(ii)\tAny application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. \n(iii)\tA student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the grace period.\n  \nConclusion\nThe STEM OPT Extension proposal has many advantages which will help fuel the U.S. economy and raise the bar for science & technology globally. The arguments that native-born workers are affected due to this program is untrue since workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs especially in specialized fields like mine. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and opportunities for native-born workers which will positively impact the economy. \n \nAdvanced degree graduates that are employed in the STEM fields contribute to the most dramatic gains. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months if not more, is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students through federal grants. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n \nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.\n\nThe OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates\n\nThe proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths.The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\n\nCap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and Should be Retained\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

Make sure the new rule comes into effect from Feb 15th 2016.Otherwise employers will be pissed off, when the student on F1-visa says he/she can't work for few months. The project in the organization has deadlines and resources are expected to complete their tasks on time.\nHence I strongly request DHS to fix this rule and make it effective on time, so that employers and as well as employees are not impacted.\n2. Increase the OPT period to 36 months. Then only it will give enough time for students to learn things on the job training.24 months is not sufficient because of the high competition for H1B visa's(Obviously employer will not be willing to lose the resource, since organization has spent lot of time & money in training the person). So employers want to make use of the trained and skilled resource and if 36 months is given, then both parties will have enough time to get H1B from this heavy competitive lottery.\nNext:\nPeople working on OPT doesn't come cheaply for organizations. Employers advertise for job positions and since they are not able to find Native American's with those skills, they go for international students with the cost of sponsoring them visas. So my point is, international students are not pulling the jobs of American's by working for fewer wage.(Average American Indian house hold income is 90K and the average American income is 40K). This tells immigrants don't get jobs because they are cheap, but they get jobs since they are needed.\nOn an average international student spends 1 year on writing GRE, TOFEL, Appling for universities, getting visa and on top of that paying extra fee to study. He/she works hard on an average of 3 years to complete their education and at the end most of the campus placement companies says; sorry we are not hiring people, who need sponsorship. Then people start applying; through job portals and end up getting one call for every 100 job applications. This employer conducts 3 to 4 rounds of interview and finally selects the student, because they were not able to find anyone from market. All of a sudden, some tech organization sues the rules made by agencies and employers are frustrated with hiring international students because of immigration policies.\nSo employers loose talent people and loose the competitive edge over their competitors who have MNC companies. When there is no competition, you get trash not cream. America imports oil from Saudi Arabia, Cars from Japan, TV's from Korea, whisky from Scotland, smart brains from India. So immigrants are not doing harm to citizens of America, they are helping to create jobs, improve the economy of the country, filling the needs of the country by sacrificing the livelihood with their families back in their own countries.\nSo I humbly request DHS to implement this new rule by Feb 15th 2016 and provide the stem opt for 36 months.

International students have been a very important group of American education system as they are contributing diversity, academic achievemnt to the country from technology development perspective, and since the number of international students is huge, the economic growth of the country also benefit from their huge amount of consumptions.\n\nSecond, the technology development would benefit from having more skilled, educated technicians. Let's take Silicon Valley, CA as an example: about 36% of the employees working for the technology companies are foreign born and the majority of the 36% employees are international students who are working on their OPT. Imagine that if the OPT extension rule was revoked, these international employees would be forced back home and that would bring a great loss for the companies. Many of the important ongoing projects could even be forced to stop forever. And that would definitely bring a negative impact on the technology and economic development for California and even the country (think about how important the Silicon Valley is in terms of technology and economic growth).\n\nThird, some people may hold the opinion that STEM graduates could work on the one-year OPT after graduation. But the fact is new hires will need at least 6 to 8-month training before they could get to know the work process of the company and make contributions. If they will have to leave right after they are ready to work more efficiently and effectively, companies would not even hire them at the beginning. The 24-month extension would definitely solve this problem, and it provides an excellent opportunity for both the employees to get more familar with the work and the employer to know more about the employee, it gives the employers more time to evauate the employee in order to make decisions on whether sponsoring the employee or not. Thus, this action will largely decrease the risk for both sides of employment.\n\nLast, becuase of the cap of the H1-B work visa, there are thousands of thousands of newly hired international employees competing for the limited positions (that's why it is called a lottery). Under this circumstances, strange phenomenons are appearing like companies specilizing in helping their employees particiting in this lottery even the employees are currently not in U.S..

My OPT STEM extension expires in December 2015 and I was hoping this rule which extends the STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months will be implemented sooner so that I can benefit from it too by allowing me to have one more chance at H-1B (I did not get selected last year). Still, I am glad that at least others who are not so close to end of their extension period will be able to benefit from it - my husband being one of them. He completed PhD in electrical engineering from a major university and is working as senior hardware engineer in a reputed company. But his H-1B application did not get selected in the lottery last year either and we are faced with a very real situation of having to leave US and rebuild our future elsewhere. This rule would definitely help him (and thereby, us). \n\nIt would be great if the rule can be implemented in such a way that if people like me who will potentially be in the 60-day grace period after expiration of OPT status when this rule comes into effect can also apply for the remaining 7 months (24 -17) of the OPT extension. This would allow us to have one more chance of applying for H-1B. I have done masters in a microbiology-molecular biology combined program and I currently work as a scientist in a leading diagnostic company where I work on projects that make a real difference for patients and hospitals. My company values me highly for my expertise on the job and they are willing to do anything to keep me working there - but of course, there is nothing that they can do! I have more than 5 years of experience in this field (research + on the job) and yet, I am going to be out of work in December - it is very hard to come to terms with that. \n\nThis STEM extension is absolutely necessary for students graduating in these times - number for applications submitted for H-1B is at an all-time high and consequently the percentage of students who are able to get selected is getting lower every year.  I fail to understand the point of sending away highly skilled workers who were educated here and bringing in lesser skilled foreign workers every year though H-1B. Those big IT consulting companies don't care which of their thousands of applications get selected each year  - they can play with probability game to get a fixed number of workers in every year.\n\nStudents (especially those who spent more that 5 years doing PhD in US) having to go back to their home countries because of this is just not a fair system. I think that this rule should allow for two 24 month extensions to PhD students since they have completed the highest level of education in US - allowing them more chances to apply and get selected for H-1B definitely. Also, I think this rule is essentially forcing undergraduate and masters students to go back to school even if they don't want to just because they did not get selected in H-1B and have to keep status/ get more OPT extension. I might be an idealist, but higher education should be undertaken because the student is actually interested in it - not as a means for getting visa or keeping status. In implementing conditions like these, it is the 'real' students who go to 'real' universities who suffer.

That is, if two students have similar academic achievements, one of whom is US citizen and the other is foreigner, then US universities will definitely admit the US citizen FIRST. So those international students admitted by US universities are generally smarter than the average US students US universities admitted. So the common occurrence is that most of the students who earn a GPA of 4.0 in US universities are international. As a result, to make US universities contribute more to US economy, those smart international students must be given permission to work in US to contribute to US industry.\n\n2. Industry need more smart employees to develop. As I said in the above paragraph, international students are generally smarter than US citizens in the same universities. So US industry need those smart people.\n\n3. Giving international students more permission to work can prevent them from returning to their own countries to compete with US. It's a foolish to train a smart student and then tell them to return to our competitors. Although US is the greatest country in the work but recently its status is being challenged by countries like China. OPT extension can prevent smart people from returning to China and promote their ability to compete.\n\nSome opponents may claim US has enough STEM graduates and many US STEM graduates work in non-STEM field. I cannot agree with them because:\n\n1. There are many reasons why many US STEM graduates don't work in STEM field. Some of them may be that other fields are more profitable than STEM field. For example, many MIT STEM graduates work as real estate agents, which is NOT a STEM field. Because many real estate agents have much higher salaries than STEM field. The house prices in San Francisco is extremely high. Selling a house with price of 2 million dollars in San Francisco can give 120 thousand dollars to the agent. If an agent can sell 10 houses per year then he can earn 1.2 million dollars, which is much higher than if he/she remains in STEM field. So many US graduate volunteer to go to non-STEM field because of a higher salary. So many US STEM graduates work in non-STEM field does NOT lead to the conclusion that US has enough STEM graduates.\n\n2. Even if there are enough STEM graduates, it still does NOT mean every sub-field in STEM has enough graduates. For example, US is in shortage of graduates with Computer Science major. That's why most of the H1B and EB green cards are given to Computer Science workers, while there are quite few workers in other STEM field are given H1B or EB green card. So it's necessary to give more working permission to Computer Science students to meet the demand of US labor market, even if there are enough STEM graduates in field other than Computer Science.\n\nBesides, the new rule proposal does a very good job in preventing employers from hiring cheap international students because it requires the wage of OPT graduates cannot be lower than US graduates. It's very good.\n\nFinally, I want to propose some minor changes to the new rule:\n\n1. It seems employers are required to provide something like training plans for OPT students. I don't think that's necessary because every employer have plans for their employees, even if their don't submit it to USCIS. This step is completely redundant.\n\n\nThank you ", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Zhehao Li"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2835": {"commentText": "I have been studying bio-medical science for my PhD and working on cancer genomic research in a national and international renounced hospital.

There still are not enough U.S. students graduating with advanced degrees in these fields to fill highly specialized positions. A 2012 report co-sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that every foreign-born student who graduates with an advanced degree from a U.S. university and stays to work in a STEM field creates on average 2.62 jobs for U.S. workers, often because they help lead in innovation, research and development. Without the availability of the OPT STEM extension, the H-1B visa program is the main avenue for foreign-born individuals with U.S. degrees to stay in the U.S. to work in the STEM field. Yet, the H-1B visa program only sets aside 20,000 visa numbers for individuals who have earned a Masters degree, or above, at a U.S. university. This has led to an immigration policy which selects the best and brightest by random lottery, not by merit.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 17 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students.

If US economy were to go into a recession and STEM employers decide to cut jobs, DHS should stop take steps to prevent employers from hiring OPTs before the people who were let go. DHS should consider adding an automatic stop to issuing OPTs when unemployment in STEM fields goes above 5%, or some level that DHS seems appropriate, is recommended.\n\nWith pro-growth policies that have controls to handle the unexpected, I am confident OPTs can benefit the US economy.\n\n ", "confidence": "52.7751", "result": "Neutral", "author": "Anonymous"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3130": {"commentText": "I think we need expanding.Because the expanding of OPT time for STEM major will give the US power for economy.Many technology companies need more and more stem majors' students.At the same time,the expanding of OPT time will attract many International students to come to US for studying.It will also give more jobs' chances for local school area.", "confidence": "92.1264", "result": "Positive", "author": "Zhonghua Liang"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3131": {"commentText": "I am extremely supportive of the new OPT STEM extension policy.\n   \nFirstly, the United States itself was historically built upon immigrants.  Traditionally, America is referred as a \"melting pot,\" and welcomes people from lots of different countries, races, and religions, all hoping to find freedom, new opportunities, and a better way of life.  It is this CHERISHED VALUE that attracts the most talented people all over the world to come to US and then contribute to the development of the science, culture and economy, making the US better and better.  For example, a considerable amount of the Nobel laureates in US are first-generation immigrants.  However, the prior OPT STEM extension cancellation pushes over ten thousands of people to leave US all of sudden.  If this occurred, this event would release a signal that US is not welcoming immigrants anymore, extremely violating its traditional value and also extremely discouraging talented people further come to US world-widely. \n\nSecondly, a majority of the students using OPT STEM extension hold a doctoral degree.  They actively work in colleges and companies to seek experiences that they could not obtain during their earlier studies, during which they apply their prior knowledge to some new research areas so as to advance the science and technology.  This process usually combines with the emergence of new ideas, collaborations and patents, novel products, and new entrepreneurs chances, which will eventually create more job opportunities in future.  This highly benefits the economy of the US.  Additionally, during the OPT period, students may find the weakness of their knowledge.  Then, they can contact their prior colleges so as to let them improve their quality of US education in future. \n\nThirdly, students using OPT STEM extension come from a variety of countries, each with their own special culture.  Having them together here helps US understand and learn the diversity of culture in the world.  For example, thanks to the immigrants with different backgrounds in the Bay Area, we now can easily enjoy different types food, music, art and literature.  \n\nBesides, at least I dont see the point of simply sending students in STEM areas back to their own countries immediately after their graduation.  Instead of letting them use their obtained knowledge to contribute the science and economy of US for a couple of years after their graduation, sending these talented doctoral students back to build their own countries stronger will significantly hurt US competitiveness in future. \n\nOccasionally, I heard from some people that they worry that these talented foreign students will steal job opportunities, making them more difficult to find a job.  However, the best solution to improve unemployment rate is to create more job opportunities rather than everyone brutally fighting for one job all the time.  Look at how many new companies and new job opportunities has been created by foreign students every year, then you can easily see if these talented students really steal your job or actually create a job for you!\n\nIn summary, I highly welcome this new policy, and I believe this policy will continuously attract the most talented people all over the world to build a stronger and better US with advanced science and technology, various culture, and dynamic economy. \n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Wenju Bai, Stanford University"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3132": {"commentText": "I am in complete agreement to this newly proposed rule to have STEM OPT extension of 24 months.

Being a STEM student from an accredited US university, I'm in favor of the proposed rule for following reasons. \n\n1) Expanding OPT upto 3 years in the new proposed rule not only gives a training benefit to the students but also provides a good number of home grown STEM workers to US employers. These employers will not only benefit from the expertise gained by these students in US universities but also by a student's insight into their respective home/foreign markets and thus benefitting the US employer. \n \n2) I have read and heard a lot of arguments where it is often stated that OPT STEM workers are a source for \"cheap labor\". So far whatever I've seen from my employment experience is not all US employers hire foreign workers its only a handful of them. Those who employ foreign workers like me offer competitive compensation, which of course is decided by education level as well as professional experience. All of my ex employers have offered me the market rate as they would have offered to an American worker. Moreover, I was told they would sponsor H-1B which adds on to their expenses. I can be sure about this as I had the opportunity to be involved in one of my ex employers budgeting session where a budget was set aside for a role irrespective of the nationality of the worker.\n \n3) As a part of Software Industry I have seen how my previous employers have struggled to find STEM workers to backfill positions. It can take upto several weeks or several months. This proposed rule would definitely increase the available STEM pool making it easy for US employers.\n \n4) As numerous F-1 students have huge student loans back in their home countries; this program gives the student a chance to take care of their financial responsibilities while contributing to the US economy. \n\n5) This proposed rule also re-instates CAP GAP relief which is much needed in case an OPT student is approved H-1B as it allows them to maintain their legal status until H-1B starts.  \n\n6) Lastly, it would be beneficial if this rule gets implemented in a timely manner, as not doing so will be disruptive in a financial aspect for a great number of employers as well as several thousands of students who will be at risk of losing their status.\n", "confidence": "99.6250", "result": "Positive", "author": "Anonymous"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2665": {"commentText": "I strongly support the OPT extension.

This is definitely a great rule and will benefit a lot!\n\n First, it is good for students, as they can apply what they learned to make contribution and convert knowledge into real value or economy for a longer time. What can you do in 12 months? Well you need to get familiar with the company, with your team, with the job, with tools they use, etc. You don't learn much and know much within this time and have to go back after. How will that be in an additional 24 months? You already know your stuff and is making contributions and gaining experience every day in this extension time! Also they will get deeper understanding on how Americans run their companies, create their new startups, and make great international businesses. These are potentially different ideas from what they know in their own country, and will help them manage their work life better in the future.\n\n Second, it is good for the society and the nation. Current OPT rule only allows foreign students to work for 12 months. What does US benefit from this? Companies have to recruit every year for new students and bring them on board, then send them away? But working for additional 24 months, on the other hand, create much value to the society and the nation. Think about how many foreign students are eager to learn latest technology from this country and how these elites can make a huge difference when they are working here for 3 years! They will help a lot for developing new technology, creating new innovative products, and bring new stuff to the whole society. How many foreign students does Google, Facebook and Apple have? And how are they rocking people's life every year?\n\n Last but not least, it is good for the business relationship between US and other countries. When these students go back to their country after OPT and extension, they will take all things they know about American business back. They will then become the bridge between businesses in US and other nations, improving international understanding and cooperation, help the growth of global economy. America will see more good stuff coming in, and sell more to others to make money (How would Uber go abroad easily without native hands in those nations? Could Apple use the same strategy from US in these other countries?). They will also spread American's good way in thinking, innovating and managing to apply in their own area.\n\n There are still other benefits that can be achieved with this extension rule, yet I already wrote a lot. As President Obama said once, America should not just educate these foreign students and simply send them back.

I completely support this amendment!\n\nIt is common knowledge that companies in STEM fields perennially face shortage of highly skilled employees, and suffer as a result of this dearth, which in turn affects the economy. There are over 5 million jobs in STEM \n(http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2014/02/05/report-stem-job-market-much-larger-than-previously-reported) \nand a lot of those go unfilled every year because of lack of skilled employees; there are just not enough US citizens who are able and willing to fill these positions. Over 4 million STEM jobs go unfilled each year (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real). Over 500,000 skilled positions are unfilled \n(http://www.cbsnews.com/news/three-million-open-jobs-in-us-but-whos-qualified/)\nThus OPT (and H1B) is not just an opportunity for students on F1 visa, it is an economic requirement of this country. For e.g. more than half of silicon valley workers are OPT and H1B workers, and the economy there is highly dependent on OPT and H1B workers. The same is true of many other economic and tech hubs in this country. Unfilled positions means billions of dollars lost (http://www.businessinsider.com/industries-with-unfilled-jobs-2014-11).\n\nGiven that H1B visas are limited in number and each year the number of applicants are high, there is a 1 in 3 chance of getting an H1B visa during one fiscal year. As a result, without the OPT extension, 2 out of 3 STEM workers would have had to leave the country, and work in another country and compete against us. This 24-month STEM extension provides a much needed relief for such workers, and a chance to apply for H1B in next fiscal year. In addition, OPT will also drive wages up, as STEM workers on OPT have a much better flexibility of changing jobs, and a much better opportunity of wage increase. The sheer requirement of high-tech workers drives wages up (http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/05/10-h1b-visas-stem-rothwell-ruiz).\n\nThis amendment is an example of good and timely action taken by DHS to improve upon the court ruling, and if implemented, would be a great economic boost to this nation, as well provide much needed relief to thousands of students currently on OPT.

I have nothing against OPT/H1B visas but DHS should check the misuse of OPT visas and H1B visas done by the consultancies/employers.\n\nMassive visa fraud is happening in the broad day light done by Indian consultancies. These so called Indian employers fake their resume and select candidates who are in OPT claiming that they have H1B visa. They run fake pay rolls and hire mostly Indian grads from US universities who can't even speak proper English. These so called consultancies get projects from companies(subcontracted by them) by showing that they have a very strong experienced workforce with 5-10 years experience. Most of the interviews with contractors are done through Skype and questions are answered by an experienced guy who will be on loudspeaker during the interview. While the actual candidate will lip sync to proxy candidate's reply to interviewers questions. Companies have hired thousands of fake candidates like this and some of them got fired. Consultancies/employers will lose that job contract as a result of this. But they will continue doing this as a candidate with US degree is their cash cow. These companies won't do background check properly and a person with a fake profile joins them. Within a span of 1 month they will be caught and kicked out. Some lucky ones stay there with the help of skilled proxies. These fake candidates will share their laptop screens with proxy worker sitting in India and get this work done. There are lots of fraudulent practices happening without the notice of officials and the industry.\n\nRecent examples are raids conducted by DHS on couple of Indan IT consultancy firms based in California and New Jersey. They arrested some Indian entrepreneurs who ran fake pay roll and employed candidates with fake experience. If you check the number of H1B visa applications you will realize the shocking number of applications that were duplicated by these con men. \n\nWithin a year, the H1B applications will overflow to 300,000 numbers because most of these consultancies will put 3-4 applications to get their H1B selected. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and other companies that apply for more than thousands of H1 visa applications should be investigated as such companies employ less than 30 percent American citizens. \n\nAs an American citizen, I am fed up of these consultancies and fake candidates. Because of their fraudulent activities many companies don't trust Indian graduates. It's become a stereotype that an Indian students always cheats in exams, fakes their resume and get jobs which should be given to genuinely experienced candidates.\n\nThis brain drain concept is completely ridiculous. I don't believe that USA as a great country needs foreign graduates to save economy or future of this country. Most of the foreign students especially Indian and chinese are here to make money and they don't come here to create jobs or create intelligent kids to save United States. It's a shame that United States as a great country can't control such frauds from taking advantage of this system. Please do a thorough investigation on such people and make OPT rules strict to prevent such malpractices by consultancies. \n\nIt is also important to save American jobs for American people. I would like to recommend that any employer should call foreign graduates only after they have interviewed a specific number of American candidates to make sure that the priority is given to American citizens. Please do the needful to stop these fraud Indian consultancies. Rather than giving OPT visas to all students who graduate here in USA, you should implement a system where students with good academic credentials directly benefit from system. Those who fake their credentials should be punished by cancelling the OPT and deporting them back to where they came from. \n\nPlease strictly enforce OPT visa holders to work in their corresponding fields they have their degrees based on. Recently, I have noticed that many of the mechanical engineering grads started working with these IT consultancies with fake profile and fake experience. Please take necessary steps to avoid such issues in future. Please stop them from changing companies during the OPT period. This will make sure that those who fake resumes to join a company will pay the price eventually. Stop graduates working with fake experience and taking away American jobs!! \n\nTo avoid faking resumes and profiles by these con artists, I hereby request DHS to enforce background check rules on these candidates before they even start their jobs. If you don't take care of concerns raised by American workers like me eventually this rule will be thrown out by another judge in the court. So I hope you'll address my concerns to implement a strong rule to avoid such fraudulent activities by foreign graduates and Indian consultancies. \"\n\n", "confidence": "99.7208", "result": "Negative", "author": "Anonymous"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2060": {"commentText": "I support this new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months .

I will first address the benefits of having the OPT STEM program and then point out many flaws in criticisms against it.\n\nOPT STEM program creates job and value-add for U.S. economy. There are approximately 900,000 international students studying in the U.S., and they pump $27 billion into the U.S. economy each years, supporting 350,000 American jobs. It is not uncommon for an overseas family to spend $100,000 or more per year for their child's college tuition and living expenses in America. Many of these students are attracted to U.S. universities not only because of the high education quality but also the prospects of working for U.S. firms for some time to learn the valuable skills that will benefit their long-term career goals. One year of OPT is apparently not enough to cultivate any meaningful experiences, especially for STEM fields whose research projects usually last for years. Not having the STEM option will make the whole U.S. education experience less attractive compared to other U.S. competitors who are aggressively attracting foreign talents such as Singapore, Germany, U.K. etc,...\n\nThe most important contribution of STEM students though are the new products and businesses they create after joining the workforce. According to a report by The New American Economy, 40% of the largest U.S. firms were founded by immigrants or first-generation immigrants, including many hottest tech startups. For example, Whatsapp, which sold to Facebook for $19 billion, was founded by a Ukrainian immigrant. In Silicon Valley, 50 percent of the tech companies, from Google to eBay, have an immigrant founder. 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child or an immigrant. For every 100 international STEM students who remain in the U.S. after graduation, 262 American jobs are created. \n\nCritics of the STEM OPT program have argued that STEM graduates accept lower pay, steal job and that there is no lack of demand for STEM workers. These claims are extremely ill-informed. First foreign STEM graduates usually work for high-tech firms and require much higher pay, especially those with Ph.D. degress. Second, there is higher risk to hire foreign STEM students and therefore the standards imposed on them are also higher. If they manage to get the jobs, you can't say that the jobs are stolen. The proposed rule also makes it clear that measures will be implements to ensure no lay-offs of American workers as a result of hiring foreign STEM graduates. Third, there is a lack of STEM talents in the U.S., period.  \n\nI would suggest that ICEB provides guidance regarding the cases of already-approved EAD's and strongly urge that it honors its commitments to these cases.\n\nReference:\nhttp://www.governing.com/gov-institute/voices/col-entrepreneurial-immigrants-international-students-community-development.html\n\n\n\n\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Anonymous (V. L.)"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3829": {"commentText": "There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, in a letter to President Obama, stated:\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\" I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nThe proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it. The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\n\nOPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers. Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\nIf the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? \n\nThere is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates. U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000. DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly. If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\n\nNot only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. A 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.\n\nThe worker protections included in the new rule \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.They do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, they chase Americans out of computer science and they create a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields.\"\n\nTo summarize, this proposed rule is so ill-advised that it needs to be totally scrapped.

US educated international students have undergone an education system that is continually tuned and updated for the innovative needs of US Industries. By letting them go out of the country, they carry the learning with them and benefit their country of origin than the USA. \n2.

The OPT extension opportunity will encourage more students to study in the USA (vis--vis other countries) thus supporting the US economy further.\n4. Balancing supply of STEM skilled workforce with demand helps keep the labor rates competitive for the industry and keeps costs and inflation down.\n5. By increasing OPT duration, the nation will be able to reduce dependence on H1B, as companies will have the option to assess competencies of the US educated graduates during the OPT period and give them the first shot at an H1B, before looking for overseas candidates. This gives the nation to seek a good balance between OPT and H1B programs.\n6.

It is in this context that i would like to suggest that the wording pertaining to the proposed mentoring and training program be  the proposed rule be looked into and maybe come up with a wording which doesn't sound negative for the employers. The current wording suggest additional work for an employer and doesn't necessarily inspire confidence for the employers to look out for the talent base from F1 students. A really useful and capable student can miss out on the opportunity to contribute towards his own growth and probably working towards making the organization better since the employer feels that it is too much a hassle in the hiring and development of a F1 student with no guarantee of a work visa such as H1 guaranteed. \n\nAn employer hiring usually looks at a candidate from a long term perspective and expects results from the candidate. But the current wording indicates more towards an employer having to use their other resources towards a F1 Student without any assurance of returns in the long term. This might cause the employers to be reluctant to hire Graduates which would effectively defeat the purpose of this rule.

Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\nOn a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Justin Steindorf"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2076": {"commentText": "It is really urgent for international students.

This rule would definitely help me, and it can even further help my wife who was also not selected at H-1B lottery this year. Her OPT STEM extension expires in December 2015 and I was hoping this rule, which gives her 7 more months of OPT, will be implemented sooner allowing her to have one more chance at H-1B. I would like to further suggest changing this rule in a way such that people like my wife who will potentially be in the 60-day grace period after expiration of OPT status (Feb 2015 for my wife) would also be able to use this extension. This will give them another chance to apply for H-1B and keep contributing to American economy.

This leads to a significant decrease in the chances of students, who have spent years here studying and honing their skills, getting a H-1B visa. It is difficult to understand the point of sending away highly skilled workers who were educated here and are already well-versed and immersed with the US culture, and instead bringing in lesser skilled foreign educated workers every year though H-1Bs. Especially the students who spent more than 5 years doing PhD in US having to go back to their home countries because of this is just not a fair system. In current rule, a student can receive one 24-months extension and can get another 24-months extension if he/she pursues and completes a higher STEM degree. This makes it unfair for students who are pursuing PhD. Once they are done with their degree, they can only get one extension as there is no higher degree to pursue.

Those students, who got high-level education from the US universities and training from the US companies, are very knowledgeable and skilled in STEM fields which are very important fields to US industry and economy. With new OPT extension rule, those students can contribute their skills and knowledge to the companies and therefore the US.     \n\n2. US companies will benefit from this new rule. Many US companies are growing and expanding their business, they are really short of hands (high-level skilled and experienced employees). The new rule will make it possible to hire eligible foreign students to work for companies for longer time. This also increases diversity of labors in the US.      \n\n3. US Universities will benefit from the new rule. The new rule will attract more foreign students to come to the US for study, because they have more possibility to stay and work in US after graduation. So this will create more job opportunities in education field and also in other related fields (Housing, Food and Restaurants, Car Buying, Insurance, etc.)       \n\n4. With the requirement that STEM OPT students should have commensurate wage with the US workers, the companies cannot consider paying less wage to OPT students than US workers so that both have equal opportunities to a job position.

However, I'm disappointed by comments from many citizens who lack 'the big picture' and only see 'unfair' competition. Please read the following:\n\n\n* On immigration in general (it's not that simple):\n\n- http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy\n- Economists generally agree that immigration is beneficial, let alone high-skilled immigration which is generally considered as a 'no brainer'. Perhaps some individuals stand to lose but the economy overall is better off. (lengthy discussion here but that's the essence. do your research)\nNote that I'm not picking topics that simply advocate for liberal immigration policy\n\n\n* On attracting high-quality students (US gets the best):\n\nThe US (so far!) attracts some of the best talent the planet has to offer especially at the graduate STEM level. They are young, intelligent, full of energy, and many look forward to a permanent presence in the US. Sure, like any immigration benefit, it will be abused. Mediocre students are surely going to take advantage of this benefit. However, that is not an excuse to limit or eliminate the benefit.\n\n\n* Connecting with broader immigration reform (US does not accommodate the highly-skilled):\n\nThis regulation is another bandaid from the executive branch since Congress refuses to act on immigration reform. Perhaps there should be some provision to stop the STEM extension if foreign/alien/non-resident students are able to obtain a more appropriate work authorization once passed (?) by congress.\n\nOn the other hand, the US lets in some ONE MILLION people every year on a permanent basis. The vast majority came in on some family-sponsorship which is a relatively straight forward procedure. My point is that these (legally considered) immigrants did NOTHING to earn the privilege to come to the US. They do not face the red tape that US-educated, hard-working, and highly-skilled people go through (F1->F1-OPT->H1B->green card). \n\nAnd don't get me started on the talk about legalizing the 11 million undocumented/illegal immigrants.\n\n\n* My motivation in writing this (I might not even get initial OPT):\n\nI've accumulated a 17 year presence in the US on temporary visas spanning my childhood and into my adulthood. That's grades 1-6, a double major STEM BSc, most of a STEM PhD (exited with a MSc), and a second STEM MSc. Without much professional experience, I've gotten interest from employers working literally in the national interest of the US. Yet, as I finish my second MSc, USCIS my not give me the benefit of the doubt in my particular situation and issue me a second initial OPT period.\n\n\n* :\n\nAfter all this time, I do appreciate the chance to comment here as a 'foreigner'.

Nonetheless, such a provision should enhance the overall work experience of our graduates.\n\nI believe 24 months of STEM extension employment would be an improvement to the educational experience for students (section III.B).

The longer they are out (post-college), the more difficult this becomes.  This proposed requirement makes worlds of sense!\n\nAs for students submitting an evaluation of his or her STEM OPT every six months to their DSO (V.D.), I am not sure that all DSO's are qualified to assess if graduates are truly meeting their goals.  I sometimes have just a basic understanding of what students are doing likely because both of my degrees are in the social sciences.  I don't believe such a designation is appropriate for many administrative employees of colleges and universities.  I also know that students will not consistently meet this requirement.  It's been burdensome to comply with the validation reporting requirements since students often don't stay in touch with us, regardless of requirements.  I'd urge DHS to please reconsider this provision.\n\nFinally, I wholeheartedly support a second period of STEM OPT being available to students who obtain a second qualifying STEM degree (V.B).  I also think it's very wise to allow students to work in the field of a previously earned qualifying degree, providing that the degree is from an accredited institution and the work would be directly related to that STEM major (V.F).

If we dont fulfill this quickly, there will be lots of negative effects appearing in different fields. I will present those in the following:\n\n1.\tIn the short term, a short OPT can severely decrease the possibility of companies hiring new graduate students. As we know, most international students are willing to study in the US, because they can receive better education, and the most important, they can find a job and stay in their dream country after graduation. If the OPT period is short or the OPT extension is terminated, thousands of international students will not continue their education in US, who have already gave big financial support for US universities.   \nBesides that, most tech companies in US will need more efforts to hire suitable employees from colleges, which will increase their operation cost.\n\n2.\tIn the long term, without the contribution from international students, universities in US will lose not only tuition income, but also talent resources. This scenario will lower their standards and suffer a drop in reputation and overall quality, which in turn make them less attractive to international genius. It becomes a vicious cycle! Then the US education will be down.\nFrom the perspective of industry, the decreasing of potential employees from new college graduate, will affect the quality of job market. To compete with other foreign companies globally, US companies must move their high tech departments to China or India, who have sufficient hi-tech labor. Otherwise those big companies like Google/Facebook/Apple/Intel would lose competitiveness, so as to bankrupt. As a result, its obviously that the job positions will be cut down accordingly. \nFurthermore, those side effects will make US lose her lead in technologies, and finally US cannot beat China/Germany/India in all fields.\n\nIn summary, Im happy to hear that 17-month OPT extension can be 24 months or more.

It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\nAnd finally:\n\"One of the big education pushes in the United States is to increase STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education and create a workforce better suited to the jobs available in the modern era.

Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they will cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley stated that the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country.

The reason they gave in extending their F-1 student visa status was to allow the students to gain on-the-job-learning.\nMy understanding is that by hiring these graduates, companies do not have to deduct Social Security and Medicare taxes from these employees  a savings of $12,000 per year. \nUnless these employers can prove that they cannot find U.S. college graduates, with STEM Degrees, we are creating an unfair hiring advantage to alien graduates over our very own college graduates. This is a terrible plan!\nImmigration policies should be for our countrys benefit not to encourage the  hiring of aliens over our own unemployed citizens. According to the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Sarah R. Saldaa, Our nation will benefit from keeping international students here, educated in U.S. colleges and universities here while they receive additional training, rather than sending them out of the country. At the same time, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by U.S. educated-STEM students, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries.  \nWe are not talking about students who have business degrees in their native countries; we are talking about high school graduates who are not required to have previous STEM working experience in their native countries before they enter our colleges or universities. We are not sending them out of the country; we are giving them an educational STEM Degree and letting them return to their own countries to enhance their own countries business communities. At the same time our colleges and universities are charging out of state tuition fees.\n\nI ask myself, Who benefits under this program? First the foreign students benefit because they get a college degree in STEM and on the job training with a mentor for three years while they are being paid. They also get experience in our business community and marketplace. Secondly their foreign countries  benefit because when the students return, they have STEM educated students with three years of practical experience in STEM companies. Finally our STEM businesses benefit because they get employees at a cost benefit of $36,000 for three years.\nNow, who doesnt benefit? First qualified U.S. students who have to compete for jobs against alien students who save the hiring companies $36,000. These are students, most likely with student loans, trying to enter a job market that already has millions of other students graduating with not nearly enough jobs waiting for them. Secondly our countrys Social Security and Medicare Programs loose taxes that would have been collected from U.S. citizen student graduates working in those jobs.\n\nThe only reason for this program extension should be allowed is if the companies hiring these students can prove that they cannot get qualified U.S. citizen graduates for these jobs. To prevent companies from entering this program just to get cheap labor, they should have to pay the students the same pay scale that a U.S. student would have gotten for the same job and charge the student an on the job training/mentoring  fee of $12,000.00 per year. The fee would go onto our Social Security and Medicare Programs.

Generally, I am never wanting for stimuli that foster a visceral disgust at the everyday sellout of U.S. citizens in employment context; there is a rotten cornucopia of anecdotes involving U.S. citizens being cut loose so that foreign workers can take their place.

Businesses in the United States should be compelled by law to hire from that vast pool (over 18 and under 65) a U.S. citizen. There should be provision in the law for the hiring of non-citizens, but *only* as a measure of last resort. Common sense compels the conclusion that to do anything less is to give U.S. citizens seeking employment the proverbial \"shaft.\"\n\nI am doubtful that there are not enough U.S. citizens with STEM degrees, either unemployed or seeking employment in STEM fields, to fill the vacancies that these businesses purport are best filled by foreigners. To a greater degree, I am certain that the businesses which complain of an ache that can only be soothed by foreign labor are motivated by the desire to pay lower wages and lower employment taxes.\n\nMake the right decision, and be lauded for sticking up for U.S. citizens with STEM degrees that are unemployed or seeking employment in a STEM field.\n\nMake the wrong decision, and this U.S. citizen will make yet another entry in the list of \"Instances of the Government Favoring the Interests of Foreigners over the Interests of Citizens.\"\n\n\n\n", "confidence": "94.1879", "result": "Positive", "author": "Dale Race"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2790": {"commentText": "I strongly support this.

Many of those students are funded through US government/industry grants. On an average $200,000 is spent on a PhD student towards his degree, and it makes no sense to train these highly qualified people and then letting them go without any contribution to our economy. \n\nInternational students add significant value to the U.S. economy after graduation as researchers and entrepreneurs. Measures that would make it easier for STEM graduate students to obtain visas to work in the U.S. after graduation - measures that many in higher education see as crucial to the U.S. maintaining its edge in attracting international graduate students -- are critical to sustained economic expansion.  \n\nOther countries are developing policies to promote the influx of foreign students to their shores, and there are also ways in which the current economy in the United States has reduced funding support for graduate students, which makes it more difficult to attract students to U.S. programs with attractive funding packages. It is the right time to ease visa/resident requirements to enable this considerable talent to remain and contribute to the future of our research and development activities or forfeit our lead to other nations.\n\nA report by the National Foundation for American Policy found that U.S. employers have spent some $3 billion in mandatory application fees since 2000 to bring over foreigners on H-1B employment visas, hardly a cheap expense, and foreign nationals are often paid much more in the United States than they would make in their home countries.\n\nThe argument that students on STEM OPT can replace US workers is very weak one.

These exposures adds up to their training experiences and once on 1st year of OPT they start working full time like any other regular candidates. Now while filing STEM extensions most of the students already have 1 to 1 and half years of US work experience (on top of any previous work experience in the field from their origin country). In fact towards the end of the 1st year OPT many students file their H1 visa applications too. Some may even have already changed jobs or in process of changing jobs while filing the STEM extension, so it may not make any sense to ask the new employer for these paper work when the employer is hiring the student thinking he is an experienced candidate to do the job. Therefore, I feel the Mentoring and Training programs may add up to unnecessary paper work in some scenarios for employers. This would even make harder for students to find a job easily because the process may seem too much extra work to employers or may make them feel the candidate is not yet prepared for the job since he needs training. I think the Mentoring and Training program needs modification depending on the students education and work profile, specifically in case of Graduate Students.

For non-STEM areas, OPT STEM does not apply to international students at all, which means the work opportunities available to US citizens in these areas will not be reduced at all. On the other hand, in STEM areas, although OPT STEM allows more international talents to work in US, it will also increase the absolute amount of working opportunities to US citizens in the long term.\n\nPeople with extraordinary skills are the key to improve the power of the country and push the development of the society. This is especially true in STEM areas. United States, as a country built by talents from all over the world, is currently the most creative, most productive and strongest country in the world. This is due to its open policy for importing talents, regardless of their citizenship. However, talents now find it harder and harder to stay in US to use their extraordinary ability. The limitations on immigration policy is already out-of-date, and the existence of H1B lottery is a good proof it. There is an urgent need to improve this situation. A country without rapid economics increases will never have enough energy to create sufficient open jobs in the market, making the country less attractive to hi-tech workers, thus slowing down its development even more. This is a negative feedback, which will eventually take US out from the top place in the list of countries attractive to talents, weaken its economy and technology rankings in the world, and reduce the amount of available open jobs. This impairs benefits of both US citizens of international talents, hence we should not allow it to happen.\n\nBy contrast, the 24 month OPT STEM is the ideal solution to turn it into a positive-feedback and benefits both US citizens and international talents together. International students studying in the US usually have better skills in their studying areas compared to people staying in their own countries. The key to maintain a sustainable development of the workforce market is to keep these talents in the US. 24 month OPT STEM gives US employers more time to hire international talents, providing these talents with longer duration to contribute to US. Moreover, it also gives US employers longer time to filter out the best from the best people, and make their workforce most productive and of highest quality. Another benefit of 24 month OPT STEM is, it gives hi-tech workers more chances to apply for H1B work VISA, improving the likelihood of their long-term staying in the US and continuous contribution to the US economy. Only by keeping the top level workforce can the US job market keep growing and provide larger amount of jobs to US citizens.\n\nMaintaining the attractiveness to talents worldwide is the key to ensure the overall welfare of US people and government, as well as an energetic job market filled with more opportunities for US people.

OPT Extension (24-month) along with 12-month OPT will help international STEM students significantly because all academic, private or public organizations/companies require both academic knowledge and practical experience. OPT extension will help to grow American economy as well.\n\nI would like to describe my personal circumstance. I have completed my first Master's in Agricultural Engineering from a U.S. research university. In that degree, I took few GIS (Geographic Information System) courses to implement GIS knowledge in Agricultural Engineering. Then I have completed my second Master's in Geography at the same university and worked in a NASA funded project as a graduate research assistant. Later, I recognized GIS major is defined as STEM (CIP code 45.0702 (Geographic Information Science and Cartography)) but Geography is not (CIP code 45.0701 (Geography)). However, most of the graduate level coursework and research of GIS (Geographic Information System) in the U.S. universities are offered in Geography departments. Additionally, offering PhD in GIS (CIP code 45.0702) is very rare in U.S. universities. Therefore, geography should be included as a STEM major.\n\nNow, I am in OPT and gaining experience in GIS related area and would like to acquire 3 years (12 months OPT + 24 months OPT extension) practical experience and then I would like to go for my PhD in geography and would like to acquire practical experience again. Therefore, STEM OPT extension is crucial for me. If geography is not included as STEM, international students like me need to go another country for PhD in geography where we can complete PhD and achieve practical experience (e.g., 36 months) in this field. I also published a paper in a peer reviewed journal why geography should be included as STEM (doi:10.5539/jgg.v7n1p27): http://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jgg/article/view/43858/24468. I urge DHS to include geography (CIP code 45.0701) in STEM list so that we can pursue our PhD in geography from a U.S. university. Please feel free to contact with me if you need additional information.\n\nAlso, please make \"exit and re-entry\" easy for international students in OPT period.

I will first address the benefits of having the OPT STEM program and then point out many flaws in criticisms against it.\n\nOPT STEM program creates job and value-add for U.S. economy. There are approximately 900,000 international students studying in the U.S., and they pump $27 billion into the U.S. economy each years, supporting 350,000 American jobs. It is not uncommon for an overseas family to spend $100,000 or more per year for their child's college tuition and living expenses in America. Many of these students are attracted to U.S. universities not only because of the high education quality but also the prospects of working for U.S. firms for some time to learn the valuable skills that will benefit their long-term career goals. One year of OPT is apparently not enough to cultivate any meaningful experiences, especially for STEM fields whose research projects usually last for years. Not having the STEM option will make the whole U.S. education experience less attractive compared to other U.S. competitors who are aggressively attracting foreign talents such as Singapore, Germany, U.K. etc,...\n\nThe most important contribution of STEM students though are the new products and businesses they create after joining the workforce. According to a report by The New American Economy, 40% of the largest U.S. firms were founded by immigrants or first-generation immigrants, including many hottest tech startups. For example, Whatsapp, which sold to Facebook for $19 billion, was founded by a Ukrainian immigrant. In Silicon Valley, 50 percent of the tech companies, from Google to eBay, have an immigrant founder. 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child or an immigrant. For every 100 international STEM students who remain in the U.S. after graduation, 262 American jobs are created.\n\nCritics of the STEM OPT program have argued that STEM graduates accept lower pay, steal job and that there is no lack of demand for STEM workers. These claims are extremely ill-informed. First foreign STEM graduates usually work for high-tech firms and require much higher pay, especially those with Ph.D. degress. Second, there is higher risk to hire foreign STEM students and therefore the standards imposed on them are also higher. If they manage to get the jobs, you can't say that the jobs are stolen. The proposed rule also makes it clear that measures will be implements to ensure no lay-offs of American workers as a result of hiring foreign STEM graduates. Third, there is a lack of STEM talents in the U.S., period.\n\nI would suggest that ICEB provides guidance regarding the cases of already-approved EAD's and strongly urge that it honors its commitments to these cases.", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Greg Jamba"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2512": {"commentText": "this is very good rule helps students and corporate to get skilled labor  ", "confidence": "99.2922", "result": "Positive", "author": "Sai Ram Sandhineni"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2515": {"commentText": "Please see the comments in the attached.\n\n\n", "confidence": "61.5709", "result": "Neutral", "author": "Danni Ye"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2514": {"commentText": "Being a student myself, graduating from MIT and having used the OPT program, I am amazed at how hard US makes from top talent to keep working in the country.

Please note the following comments.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III A]  I support the proposal by DHS to reinstate the OPT STEM Extension in response to the judgment issued on August 12, 2015 by the U.S. District Court in the case of Washington Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security. I further hope that the final rule, following the period of public comments and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), will be published at least 60 days before the date of vacatur indicated in the courts judgment, i.e., the final rule be published in the Federal Register 60 days before February 12, 2016. This would allow time for review by Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), so that the final rule will take effect by February 12, 2016.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  I support the proposal by DHS to increase the period of OPT STEM Extension from 17 months to 24 months. Further, I also support the proposal to provide an additional OPT STEM Extension of 24 months for earning a second STEM degree of higher educational level. This regulation implies that if an international student on F-1 visa earns a qualifying STEM Masters and Doctoral degree from an accredited U.S. university, he or she would be eligible for a total of 6 years of practical training in their selected area of study. As a result, the student will be able to obtain valuable work experience and STEM skills, which might not be readily available in the home country of the student.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  The proposed rule by DHS requires students and employers to implement a formal Mentoring and Training Plan that would be submitted to the Designated School Official (DSO) before the OPT STEM Extension is granted. Further, every six months, the student is required to provide the DSO with an evaluation of his or her progress towards the training goals agreed upon. While this requirement is made in good faith, I note that there could be several reasons due to which the training goals might change. For example, the employing company might stop working on a project that was expected to increase the participating students STEM skills, and instead, request him or her to work on different project of similar nature. Therefore, the Mentoring and Training Plan must not require the student and employer to be overly specific regarding the training goals, and how progress towards them would be measured, because the projects and opportunities provided to the student might evolve or change with time.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B]  I support the proposal by DHS to include the 2008 Interim Final Rules (73 FR 18944) Cap-Gap provision, under which the DHS would temporarily extend an F-1 students duration of status and any current employment authorization if the student is a beneficiary of a timely filed H1-B petition and requests a change of status.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B]  I support the transitional measure proposed by DHS to allow a subset of students already on a 17-month OPT STEM Extension to take advantage of the proposed 24-month OPT STEM Extension by requesting the remaining 7 months of employment authorization up to 120 days before the end of the students 17-month OPT STEM Extension period. DHS has estimated that this proposal will benefit up to 18,210 students.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B]  Please clarify that, according to the proposed rule by DHS, if a students 17- month OPT STEM Extension period has begun, or will begin, before the date of vacatur of the 17-month OPT STEM Extension, and the 17-month practical training period is expected to conclude after the date of vacatur, then such students may continue to undergo practical training after the date of vacatur and remain employed until the end of the 17-month OPT STEM Extension period accorded to them.\n\nTo summarize, I strongly support this proposed regulation, and hope that it will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register in a timely manner, without incorporating significant changes. I note that if the final rule does not take effect before the date of vacatur of the current 17-month OPT STEM Extension, up to 34,000 students who are currently taking advantage of this provision will be forced to resign from the current employment and depart the United States.\n", "confidence": "99.9353", "result": "Positive", "author": "Vinay Krishnan"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0016": {"commentText": "The STEM OPT is necessary and positive.

International students have already been tied with more restrictions than green card holder or citizen in many fields (Mechanical Engineer, EE, Environmental Management, etc.). It is really hard for STEM students to find a position within 1 year, which are hurdling their ability to contribute to this country.

We all agree that the science/technological power is the key competitiveness of United States. However, it seems that: not everyone notices the fact that the science/technology power need people to contribute and do real research! Only when United States have people to do the research in science/technology can it beat other countries in the global competitions.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jo bs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa has reminded the President that, \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. T he Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\nAlso, John Miano, an attorney representing tech workers has reported that the proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mento ring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n There is a Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis who responds, \"On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\nSkilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.

OPT Extension to 24 months is necessary and benefit to US economy as well as the world's economy.There are three main reasons for why it is necessary and benefit.\n\n   First, international students plays an important part in the Computer Science industry market in US. I am an international student major in computer science in Stevens Institute of Technology.  What I have seen is most of our students in computer science department are Indian and Chinese. And my friends who are in Columbia University, King's Collage, UCLA, Northeast University and Seattle University see the same situation as I do. Those huge part of International students accepted US education, learn English and find jobs in US, they build 3D printers for constructions, create robots or machines for modern lives, build start ups to serve people,  producing cars, creating models of finance or bankings. Once they are illegal to stay in US, who could help continuing these valuable creations or innovations. And what should be doing to fulfill those gaps? Isn't it a lose of US economy?\n\n  Second, there are still a big shortage of computer science engineers for the technology industry. As I see in meet ups. Big companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, IBM, Apple and so on, still need  large quantity of engineers. even if Google has sixty thousand of employees, and Facebook has twenty thousands. Assuming that 10% of google employees have to go to their own countries annually, how many product lines should be killed? how to maintain their qualities and stabilities. The lost of engineers equals to lost of moneys in today's world. Further more, I could say it is US education who are better than any other countries attracting so many excellent students all over the world, isn't it a lost of talent for reduce the OPT extension?  \n\n  Finally, it is the poverty not wealthy people who want to immigrant to US. Most of international students can afford the tuition fees of US education. Those students are only in their 20's, they are too young to determine where to stay where to live not to say no parents no friend no relatives in US. To maintain a good education and have a sharp experience in their resume is good. 1 year is not enough to say in the resume. \n\n  All of the above, OPT extension have to be extent to 24 months.

However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\n\n* On a variety of measures, the foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.

Moreover the tuition fees paid by them are three time more that American Citizen. Allotting 24 months of OPT results in attracting more Students from foreign countries. We pay these fees and taxes because USA is land of dreams where I can explore my knowledge, skills and social life.\n\n2) A chance to obtain practical Knowledge: After graduating from accredited university the candidate is still clueless because lack of practical knowledge. 24 months OPT helps them to shine their skills and explore the technologies. \n\n3) Patents: Most of the international students graduate with Masters degree. They have SAE ad other papers released. They have patents which can be property of OEM's like GM, FORD and Chrysler. They hire them and sponsor these international students resulting in gaining ownership of those patents. This is very important point because the proportion of patents own by foreign student in USA is considerable and valuable. \n\n4)Companies Attraction because of International student :  Detroit unemployment rate were high but now it has decreased.

During my 5 years at graduate school, I received full scholarship (tuition waiver + monthly salary) which is about $400k in total and is funded completely by U.S. taxpayers (my university is a public university, and my research project was funded by U.S. Army). \n\nIf there is no OPT STEM extension available for me, under the current regulation, I have only 12 months of OPT. This is enough for doing the H1B lottery once, which has a ~50% chance of being approved. If I am not lucky enough to get the H1B work visa, I need to leave U.S. immediately after my 12-month OPT.\n\nThis means U.S. taxpayers spent $400k on training me and have a ~50% chance of losing me to a foreign country in 12 months. This means my employer, a top high-tech U.S. company has ~50% chance of losing a good employee after 12 months. I think this is a bad deal for U.S.\n\nAnd I am by no means competing with U.S. citizens for job opportunity. In my industry, there is a significant shortage of advanced degree workers. And there are simply not enough students majoring in this area (let alone enough U.S. citizens).\n\nIn the proposed rule, this won't be an issue since an F1 student with advanced degree in STEM will have at least 3 tries for H1B lottery.

Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa. \nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rulemaking. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the students 60-day grace period.\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\nThe most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Steven Sun"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3797": {"commentText": "this program is a insult to all the American citizen- students that are seeking a future of potential not the over burning of student loans with under paying corporations that extort the intent of this program.

In order to remain so, it has to consistently follow these same doctrines.\n\n,It is the people of the nation who are the greatest of all the resources and all other resources get created by these very people.

USA has attracted the best talent in the world because of its open policies and most of the intelligent, innovative and hardworking   people  in the world prefer to work in USA .

Please note the following comments.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III A] I support the proposal by DHS to reinstate the OPT STEM Extension in response to the judgment issued on August 12, 2015 by the U.S. District Court in the case of Washington Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security. I further hope that the final rule, following the period of public comments and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), will be published at least 60 days before the date of vacatur indicated in the courts judgment, i.e., the final rule be published in the Federal Register 60 days before February 12, 2016. This would allow time for review by Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), so that the final rule will take effect by February 12, 2016. \n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] Though I support the proposal by DHS to increase the period of OPT STEM Extension from 17 months to 24 months. I think this should be increased to 36 months instead of 24. Given the appalling state of the work permit process; this would greatly help students in STEM, the US Companies employing them and the US economy. After all, a majority of patents and publications come from international students. \n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] The proposed rule by DHS requires students and employers to implement a formal Mentoring and Training Plan that would be submitted to the Designated School Official (DSO) before the OPT STEM Extension is granted. Further, every six months, the student is required to provide the DSO with an evaluation of his or her progress towards the training goals agreed upon. While this requirement is made in good faith, I note that there could be several reasons due to which the training goals might change. For example, the employing company might stop working on a project that was expected to increase the participating students STEM skills, and instead, request him or her to work on different project of similar nature. Therefore, the Mentoring and Training Plan must not require the student and employer to be overly specific regarding the training goals, and how progress towards them would be measured, because the projects and opportunities provided to the student might evolve or change with time.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section III B] I support the proposal by DHS to include the 2008 Interim Final Rules (73 FR 18944) Cap-Gap provision, under which the DHS would temporarily extend an F-1 students duration of status and any current employment authorization if the student is a beneficiary of a timely filed H1-B petition and requests a change of status.\n\n[Supplementary Information, Section V B] I believe the transitional measure should be extended to all STEM students whose current STEM Extension is set to expire close to the vacatur date of Feb 12, 2016. This can be done by allowing those who are in grace period after the current STEM extension ends to request for extension of the remaining 7 months for a total of 24 months or the remaining 19 for the total of 36 months. This would greatly help the students, the US companies employing them and the economy! \n.\n\nTo summarize, I strongly support this proposed regulation, and hope that it will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register in a timely manner, without incorporating significant changes. I note that if the final rule does not take effect before the date of vacatur of the current 17-month OPT STEM Extension, up to 34,000 students who are currently taking advantage of this provision will be forced to resign from the current employment and depart the United States. \n", "confidence": "98.1689", "result": "Positive", "author": "Manny Ramaswamy, Ford Motor Company"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3508": {"commentText": "American workers and American students must come first in their own country.

When something like 50% of our citizens who graduate with science and technological degrees can not find jobs in their field, it is inappropriate, treacherous, and in fact, I would suggest treasonous of a government agency to also use taxpayer money to subsidize alien workers in those roles.

I think it will help create more jobs in the long run.

So that it does not create wrong incentives for profit oriented schools to recruit more students by promoting their educational programs as employment programs. DHS should consider using the same list of college as the H1-B advanced degree quota.\n\nMy second concern is about efficiency of mentoring program in a consulting situation. The proposed employer mentoring and training program may not be work in a consulting type work arrangement where the hired OPT student does not works directly with the employer but is working for a client in a remote location. DHS should include how the mentoring program will work in such situations.\n\nThirdly, I believe that DHS should make the proposed checks applicable to all OPTs. The proposed checks and safeguards should also apply to the first 12 months of OPT and OPTs issues in college to maintain continuity. The mentoring and training program should apply to all STEM OPT programs.\n\nLastly, the assumptions used to assess the impact on current employment in \"Regulatory Impact Analysis OPT STEM - October 2015\" document are not complete. The impact of the OPT extension cannot be looked at it by itself. It should also include the impact of all prior OPTs issued to the student including OPTs issued when in college. The more students US attracts because of the proposed extension, will also result in higher OPTs issued for the first 12 months and also OPTs issued in college.

I know people who made massive student loans. And their plan is to repay the loan in two or three years by earning the money in dollars. If the OPT stem extension was vacated their situation would be miserable. They are smart enough to get a job in their home countries if they are sent back. But repaying the loan amount would take decades. In future, this would discourage many smart students to pursue higher education in USA. This can affect US universities economically and gradually decrease the diversity of US universities.\n\nI don't see a point in vacating OPT extension, if it was to provide more opportunities to US citizens: \n\n1. The Big companies that have branches across world: They hire based on a person's talent and skills regardless of citizenship and immigration status. If they have a foreign student on 12-month OPT, rather than losing the resource due to immigration issue, the company would offer an opportunity for the same candidate offshore. This will not necessarily create new opportunities with in USA. Instead it will create a brain-drain (Skilled students will be sent away). \n\n2. Companies that are growing and don't have branches across the world: They do hire foreign students, considering the probability of getting a H1 they hire foreign students in a small percentage to avoid sudden loss of large number of employees.\n\n3. There are many small companies and start-ups that do not hire foreign students to avoid extra work. During my job search, I came across many such companies. I always wanted to work for a start-up, it disappointed me that many companies did not consider me due to my immigration status. \n\nSo I would say, US citizens have more opportunities and have higher probability of getting a job than an immigrant.

As a STEM graduate, I noticed that my STEM program has been historically dominated by international students, due to the academic rigor and the quantitative skills required in accepting candidates. Giving permissions to international students to work in the United States will not only help them attain relevant experiences, but also help their STEM programs flourish and reinforce the industry-needed skill sets in classrooms. \n\nThe proposal will benefit the U.S. economy because some technical firms would not have a sufficiently large pool of talents to grow businesses if foreign nationals are excluded. Although we see some U.S. citizens that are great at technical skills, the scale of such talents is much smaller when compared to that of international graduates.\n\nOne additional benefit of this proposal for international graduates is, obviously, the extended period to work in the United States. As an applicant who filed for a H1-B petition this year but failed in the lottery, I know that there is preponderance of evidence where a firm files multiple petitions for an employee or a working professional files multiple petitions with different employers in the H1-B lottery process. This significantly lowers the probability of an applicant (who only files for one petition with his/her current employer) to be selected in the lottery. There are even some IT firms that tend to increase the H1B pass rate for employees in numerous ways, but they do this at the cost of the applicants who work for them--the pay is generally lower, which has an unintended consequence to the job market and creates a financial edge for these employers.Therefore, having the proposal approved would help rebuild the level field in the H1B lottery and brings back fairness to international hires in the job market. \n\nIn summary, the new OPT extension proposal is a policy that is beneficial to both the U.S. economy and educational systems.

Also, the provision for extending F-1 status and any current employment authorization until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1 B visa has been requested is necessary for students and employees to maintain a valid work authorization status while they wait for their H1-B.\n\nThe STEM extension is essential because students gain valuable practical knowledge that supplements the knowledge that they gained from their academics. Often times the practical knowledge gained from 12 month OPT period is not enough to gain sufficient functional knowledge. Hence the proposed 24 month OPT extension is required so that students are able to complete their training, projects research etc and are ready to excel in their field.\n\nThe rule also guards agains the adverse effects on U.S. Workers. The rule mandates that the employer who is employing someone with a STEM extension would not lay off or terminate the employment of a U.S. worker due to the employment of the foreign national. It also makes provisions that the employer would have duties, hours and compensation commensurate with that a similarly placed U.S. worker. This would ensure that there are no adverse effects on the jobs of U.S. national as a result of this rule. Also, it mandates that the employer has work that further the knowledge gained by the student. This would ensure and cut down on the number of illegally working foreign nationals. \n\nThe rule correctly recognizes the effect of foreign students on the U.S. economy. Students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in 2013-2014 academic year. Foreign students specifically result in a huge benefit for the public colleges and universities in terms of the tuition paid as compared to in-state students.\n\nThe rule correctly recognizes that by earning a functional understanding of how to apply their knowledge in a work setting, students would be better positioned to excel in their field of work. As previously noted, the STEm extension would give sufficient time to students to complete their research, projects, tasks etc and gain a comprehensive knowledge as required by STEM courses. \n\nThe rule has correctly identified that the percentage of foreign students has been declining while that of globally competitive countries like Canada has been increasing. The proposed rule would help U.S. to remain globally competitive and attract the best talent from the world over. The rule has a huge impact as there are more than 34,000 students that are in US. as of September 15,2015. Hence, the fact that rule is brought in effect is extremely important.\n\nThe comments for the specific sections as requested by DHS are as follows:\n\n1. Length of research, development, testing and other projects for which STEm graduates from U.S. universities are typically assigned in the workplace:- As previously noted the length of the research projects etc. are often more than  the OPT period of 12 months. Hence, the proposed rule of an OPT extension is required so that students gain a strong functional and practical knowledge in their field of study. The ability to complete their training and functional application of their knowledge would also serve as a incentive to students who are planning to begin their study in U.S. and ensure that the U.S. universities and colleges remain competitive globally.\n\n2. Proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension and the ability for qualifying students to receive an additional such OPT extension based on a second STEm degree:- As previously noted the proposed 24 month OPT extension is essential for both foreign students and U.S. economy. Also it safeguards the interests of U.S. workers. I feel that an additional OPT extension based on a second STEM degree is also essential as often time the second degree is different from the previous one and a additional STEM would be required.\n\n3. Proposed transition procedures and alternatives to the potential courses of action:- I feel that DHS has correctly identified all the transition procedures and alternative and may take any one that it deems fit, in case need arises.\n\n4. Academic benefit of the STEM extension and the changes to the structure of list:- Specifically to students graduating from MIS programs, a sound functional and practical knowledge is essential so that they remain competitive in their field of work. i am sure that it is the case with other degree too.  DHS to take steps whatever necessary\n\n5. Imposing a firm accreditation :- I feel that DHS is better positioned to take a decision on this. \n\n6. Agency's estimate of the burden of collection of information:- I feel that the agency has rightly taken all the factors into consideration and come to a correct estimate.\n\n7.

Foreign students would have to work harder to get a job after graduation, because students would stay longer and have more opportunities to search for a job. In the meantime, the job opportunities at the same period of time should stay almost the same, therefore, students who have more professional skills would find the job and stay in America, improving the overall productivity in America. On the other hand, domestic students will face bigger pressure to find a job, therefore they would work harder, improving the overall productivity, too.\n\nThe second reason for agreeing to this expansion is that this would not necessarily lead to every foreign students would choose to stay in America. People sometimes worry about foreign students would stay in America and that seems to not protect Americans. This is not really the case. Nowadays people go back to their own country for different reasons. For example, as I am a student, if I have a chance to stay in the US, I probably would stay, but it also depends on my own family. If my family want me to go back to my own country, I would probably choose to go back even if I can stay in America.\n\nThis third reason to expand the legal staying period is that people can learn more and may have more contribution to their own country when they go back, therefore, improving the productivity and contribution to the world, which is the ultimate goal for studying abroad.

The additional clauses to provide protection to US workers against displacement, ensuring adequate compensation for those on OPT and limiting the program to accredited schools also serve to preserve the intent of the OPT extension program.\nThe only debatable clause in the proposed rule is the 'Training and Mentoring Plan'. While it does not ensure that it will restrict OPT program abuse, it will definitely make genuine employers think twice before hiring students on OPT. The proposed rule requires the employer to prepare a 'training plan' when the student is about to potentially begin his 2nd year of employment. Most training usually occurs in the first year on the job and the 2nd/3rd years are usually spent on 'learning by doing'. Advanced degree/Doctorate degree holders are usually the most qualified personnel in a company and those on F-1 visas use the OPT program to obtain 'practical experience' by applying their skills and knowledge in the 'real world'. They may also have junior employees reporting to them. To expect both the employers and employees to be held against a 'training plan' for 3 years of employment for highly skilled personnel does not make business sense for either party. Business plans are confidential in nature and employers may not be comfortable in releasing detailed information to external sources and the training plan documents will end up being generic documents limited to high level job descriptions. University DSOs may not also be familiar with technical job activity descriptions and may not be in a position to review and approve these documents.\n\nThe STEM OPT program was conceived to allow students multiple attempts at the H1-B visa while gaining experience. Students who apply for the STEM extn are mostly those who were petitioned for by an employer but not selected in the H1-B lottery. If the employer has already considered them for an H1-B, it means that they have been considered suitable for regular employment. To put such employees back on 'training' mode does not make sense for the employer. \n\nWhat can be done in lieu of the 'Training/Mentoring plan' is to provide USCIS with a job profile document detailing employee roles and responsibilities and an organization structure chart. The job profile provided during recruiting or advertising for the job can also be included. If there are any significant changes in job profile or positions during the course of OPT, the same can be intimated to the DSO.

A consequent effects of this is that some of the most skilled workers, workers who understand the new frontiers of technology and can give American businesses the competitive advantage, are the international students from such STEM programs.\n\n\nWhile it may be true that American workers are facing tough challenges from foreign workers, I think the WashTech lawsuit was direct to the wrong visa program.

Studying for a graduate degree from Columbia University, Meyyappan is closer than ever to achieving his goal. In the past year and a half, hes studied how solar power works as well as the policy and business of the industry. After he graduates in December, Meyyappan plans to work at a U.S. solar panel company for a couple of years. India is five years behind the U.S. in solar technology, he said. I want to work in a solar company here and apply the the experience Ive gained back home. The chance to get that work experience was the whole point of coming here. he said. His plans are now at risk because the STEM extension is now in jeopardy. \n\nThe Federal Courts decision to vacate STEM OPT Extension Rule on August 12, 2015 is leaving students like Meyyappan feeling betrayed. When we came in, we made a calculation about how much its going to cost us, and how much were going to earn, he said. I could have gone to London, I could have gone to Australia, but I chose the U.S.\n\nSome students whove gone home after being unable to secure a work visa say they were disappointed that they werent allowed to stay.

A lot of people back home think that working in the United States is like, oh shit, youre arrived, he said. If you work there, regardless of what you do, you could be an Uber driver and it still seems so prestigious.\n\nHe worked in the Bay Area after graduating, but once he ran out of OPT and didnt win the H-1B lottery, he went home. Dhillon doesnt mind working and living at home, and hes saving money, but he says if he was applying for college today, he wouldnt choose an American university.

I tell my friends, appreciate it for all its worth.\n\nAlso, U.S. companies especially tech firms say they need the talents of international students. Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language-learning app Duelingo and a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, said the limits on hiring international students were frustrating for employers like him.\n\nYou hire a person, who is extremely well educated, and you get them to come work for you, and you have a 70% chance that theyre not going to be able to stay, von Ahn said, Its terrible, because even if you hire super smart people, it takes a couple months to train them. They dont start becoming very useful to the company until about six months  and then they have to leave.\n\nIf the STEM extension isnt reinstated, he said, were probably going to lose two employees who are really hard to hire, a big problem for a small company like Duelingo with only 50 employees.

Students on a STEM extension are usually hired in specialty occupations. Training a new employee and entrusting them with responsibilities takes a substantial amount of time. If students are to contribute and gain real experience, a longer time period is necessary, and 24 months is appropriate to make a substantial impact, and kickstart a student's career.\n2.\tThe safeguards for US workers, and prevailing wage requirements alleviate concerns of STEM OPT students taking over jobs that would otherwise be obtained by US workers.\n3.\tThe mentoring and training plan requirements ensures that students will actually be employed by an employer that can provide the required guidance, training, and mentoring that they need during their early career phase.\n4.\tThe additional STEM extension is welcome news for students who are interested in working for a few years to gain practical experience before going back to school. The single OPT STEM extension per lifetime rule was overly restrictive, especially since many students go back to earn a higher degree level, and continue to contribute to the industry.\n5.\tSchool accreditation and site visits are crucial to ensure that students don't simply enroll in unaccredited schools with lax enrollment guidelines for the sole objective of obtaining work authorization.\n6.\tIncreasing the allowed period of unemployment to 150 days is a welcome relief, since the job search process is extremely stressful, unpredictable, and time consuming.\n\nThis rule provides substantial economic, academic, and cultural benefits to the United States, as specified in section IV. C. of the proposed rule. As stated in section IV. C. 2, it is important for the US to continue retaining high skilled foreign graduates ahead of other countries that may prove to be more viable destinations if the legal immigration system in the US proves to be too restrictive, cumbersome, or otherwise unfriendly to high skilled foreign graduates.\n\nWhile the rule makes some good proposals, we would also appreciate clarity on the following topics of contention:\n1.\tThe effects of a final rule not being in place by Feb. 13, 2016 on students who already have approved STEM extensions.\n2.\tWhether a higher degree in a non STEM field is grounds for a second 24 months STEM extension.\nFinally, I also suggest that students who have been on the OPT extension for a period of time be considered dual intent, and file for a green card without it having negative repercussions on future F1 visa applications.\n\nSincerely,\nAnurag Bhatt\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Anurag Bhatt"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2028": {"commentText": "help f1 students to gain knowledge", "confidence": "51.3487", "result": "Neutral", "author": "Srikum Payar, VIU"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3728": {"commentText": "This proposal is an obvious attempt to get US employers to hire foreign labor to undercut US labor costs and rewarding those companies that do with taxpayers mone for doing it.

There are couple of suggestions regarding the application of rule for existing students on OPT Extension.\n\n1. Making it mandatory to apply before 120 days of end of 17 months extension would result in many students becoming ineligible to take advantage of the rule and thus void to great extent the original purpose of this rule. Instead I believe giving such students a chance to again apply for remaining 7 months of extension within 60 days ( Time given to them to leave US) after the 17 month extension has expired would end up giving more students if not all, a better prospect to take advantage of this rule. They still wont be able to work as work permit has expired but they can legally stay like in the case of cap-gap and wait for their renewed EAD card.\n\n2. For certain students in CAP-GAP (With EAD expiring before 1st April) work authorization should be provided as they have a employer filling their H1B but they have to wait till Oct 1st (If there H1 is apporved) to start working or resume working. This makes cap-gap not that effective. If a student is considered a highly skilled labor then making that labor sit idle for 6 or more months is not fruitful to any involved parties. I believe if the employer of such students (who have their EAD expiring no earlier then 60 days (time for them to leave US ) before 1st April (Date of H1B filing)) is providing consent to file H1 for that student then such students should be provided with a extended work authorization till Oct 1st (H1B status start date provided they were approved).\n\nOnce again I would like to thank DHS and all the employees of USCIS that work so hard to provide many students like me all the help and support to overcome this tedious task of maintaining legal status in this land of free.", "confidence": "99.2290", "result": "Negative", "author": "Mohit Pillay"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1487": {"commentText": "I fully support this rule.

Purpose of the Regulatory Action\n\nThis proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a U.S. school.  The regulation seeks cheap labor, not bright students. The F1 non-immigrant classification is available to academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at any established school, even in an accredited language training program. This makes every school a qualifying school. So, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. This definition is so broad that anyone in the world would qualify.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months.  48 months is not temporary.  A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT. As stated in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code, this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B and therefore be eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. \n\nAs stated in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is an employment program only for foreign students.  U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.\n\nG. Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields.\n\nSafeguards of this proposal are deceptive, and in fact are not safeguards at all.  This proposal requires terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers.  At the same time, the regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S.workers. The Regulation does not restrict this to American workers or employers, but to other employers of the same {undefined} size anywhere in the world.  By definition, there are no similarly situated U.S. workers, so no one will meet this definition.  The employer can never be liable for replacing any U.S. Worker.\n\nIt is ridiculous to expect an employer to monitor and record his own actions by attestation.  The employer would be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.\n\nThis Regulation leaves the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers.  This would allow an employer to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign students.\n\nD. Mentoring and Training Plan\n\nThe Regulation has provisions to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign students. The Regulation leaves this to the employer.  DHS plans to have employers show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices.  This ambiguous language is intentional, and prevents the employer from being held liable for violations.\n\nThe Regulation fails to require the use of factual and actual documents to establish adverse action or impact on U.S workers.  It does not require the use of payroll records.  What an employer is paying his current employees is direct evidence.  Instead, the Regulation allows the employer to use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys to report compensation for their U.S. workers. \n\nThe Regulations are contradictory, describing employers hiring highly skilled STEM OPT students.  This is directly contradictory to the stated need for this regulation to (1) EDUCATE the un-educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un-experienced foreign student.\n\nThe Regulations do not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2013 with a master's degree in the field of IT. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.\n\nI was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.\n\nThe following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT:\nFirst, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Second, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nI urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program.

The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition.\n\nOPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months, which is nobody's definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months, then the OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program, known as pre-completion OPT, As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT.

Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students.\n\nThe Regulations fail to protect U.S. workers because the Regulations fail to gage the wages of U.S. workers.

Big Tech companies argue that there is a shortage in STEM labor. (One could infer if that there were a shortage of STEM labor, that U.S. students should have little trouble in finding jobs.) However, this alleged labor shortage is probably a myth. There are numerous recent articles that suggest there is a surplus of U.S. STEM labor rather than a shortage. For example, \"STEM Grads Are at a Loss\" by U.S. News & World Report and \"America Has More Trained STEM Graduates than STEM Job Openings\" by the Center for Immigration Studies both allude to the point I am making.\n\nMoreover, the proposal only makes reference to studies made in 2008 that suggest there is shortage in STEM labor (Section G par. 1). While those studies may have been accurate in 2008, they are outdated now.  Since the economic environment has changed substantially since the time of these studies,  a new and impartial study should be conducted in order to determine if there truly exists a STEM labor shortage, and we should conduct this study before making rules that change the OPT program.  If there is in fact a STEM labor surplus rather than a shortage and if it is true that a large portion U.S. students who graduate with STEM degrees cannot find jobs in their field following graduation, then extending the OPT program would certainly harm U.S. students. The bottom line is that we must first ensure that U.S. students have opportunities to learn from on-the-job training before we can become concerned with the needs of foreign students. Extending the OPT program now would be rash. We shouldn't jump to a decision without thoroughly understanding how the decision will impact U.S. students. \n\n\n\n\nIf anyone wishes to receive additional feedback from me, feel free to contact me the email address above.

Why is a US citizen at Disneyland working in IT losing his job to a foreign worker?\nThe whole immigration system is a failure and and a national security problem.\n\n\nImmigrants Arent the Only Ones Who Shouldnt Be Voting\nJULY 24, 2015  Ryan McMaken\n \n\nMuch of the current immigration debate in the United States centers around the issue of amnesty, which is a vague term that may mean anything from we wont deport you to lets fast-track you to citizenship and voting rights.\n\nFrom a laissez-faire perspective, the deportation aspect of amnesty  an increase in federal inaction  is one thing. The extension of voting privileges, though, is something else entirely.\n\nIndeed, the amnesty debate has helped to illustrate the difference between real, concrete property rights, and the much different political rights such as voting. Limiting property rights is always illegitimate. Limiting political rights, on the other hand, may sometimes be essential.\n\nProperty Rights vs. Political Rights\n\nFor example, everyone everywhere has property rights regardless of the type of regime they live under and whether or not the government recognizes the existence of those rights. These rights include the right to own ones own body, to own property peacefully acquired, and to enter into peaceful contracts with other people, including contracts involving employment and housing. The foreign nationals known as illegal immigrants also have these rights.\n\nBut property rights such as these should not be confused with political rights that are quite distinct from the right to self-ownership. In fact, in practice, political rights such as voting are often used to justify coercion against others in the form of expanding government spending, and government control over every aspect of daily life.\n\nCritics of amnesty who wish to further restrict the free use of property by employers, landlords, and laborers make a mistake when they try to limit immigration by restricting property rights. On the other hand, they are on more solid ground when they attempt to restrict the further expansion of government power by restricting the franchise and the number of people eligible (via citizenship) for government checks.\n\nThe assumption behind this position on immigrants is that new arrivals tend to seek an expansion of government benefits, and that they are net tax receivers who get more in tax benefits than they pay in. This is an empirical claim that may or may not be true. But, it is no doubt true that some immigrants are in fact net tax receivers, and it is in that direction that we should direct our attention.\n\nLimiting Government Size by Limiting the Vote\n\nIn making their arguments against expanding the vote to immigrants, the activists who hold this position place themselves among the few who are actually confronting the problem of widespread voting rights in a society where large numbers of net tax receivers also have the ability to vote further benefits for themselves.\n\nHowever, when we really start to examine the sheer number of voters who benefit from expansions in government spending, immigrants begin to look insignificant by comparison. The legions of government employees, government contractors, and Social Security recipients all know that any significant cuts in government spending would hurt them personally. And they vote.\n\nSo, if were going to take the position that those who benefit from tax funds should not vote, why limit ourselves to looking at immigrants?\n\nThe Net Taxpayers vs. the Net Tax Receivers\n\nIn his short book Bureaucracy, Ludwig von Mises examined this problem in the context of government employees.

I have nothing against  OPT/H1B visas but DHS should check the misuse of OPT visas and H1B visas done by the consultancies/employers.\n\nMassive visa fraud is happening in the broad day light done by Indian consultancies. These so called Indian employers fake their resume and select candidates who are in OPT claiming that they have H1B visa. They run fake pay rolls and hire mostly Indian grads from US universities who can't even speak proper English. These so called consultancies get projects from companies(subcontracted by them)  by showing  that they have a very strong experienced workforce with 5-10 years experience. Most of the interviews with contractors are done through Skype and questions are answered by an experienced guy who will be on loudspeaker during the interview. While the actual candidate will lip sync to proxy candidate's reply to interviewers questions. Companies have hired thousands of fake candidates like this and some of them got fired. Consultancies/employers will lose that job contract as a result of this. But they will continue doing this as a candidate with US degree is their cash cow. These companies won't do background check properly and a person with a fake profile joins them. Within a span of 1 month they will be caught and kicked out. Some lucky ones stay there with the help of skilled proxies. These fake candidates will share their laptop screens with proxy worker sitting in India and get this work done. There are lots of fraudulent practices happening without the notice of officials and the industry.\n\nRecent examples are raids conducted by DHS on couple of Indan IT consultancy firms based in California and New Jersey. They arrested some Indian entrepreneurs who ran fake pay roll and employed candidates with fake experience.  If you check the number of H1B visa applications you will realize the shocking number of applications that were duplicated by these con men. \n\nWithin a year, the H1B applications will overflow to  300,000 numbers because most of these consultancies will put 3-4 applications to get their H1B selected. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and other companies that apply for more than thousands of H1 visa applications should be investigated as such companies employ less than 30 percent American citizens. \n\nAs an American citizen, I am fed up of these consultancies and fake candidates.   Because of their fraudulent activities many companies don't trust Indian graduates. It's become a stereotype that an Indian students always cheats in exams, fakes their resume and get jobs which should be given to genuinely experienced candidates.\n\n This brain drain concept  is completely ridiculous. I don't believe that USA as a great country needs foreign graduates to save economy or future of this country.  Most of the foreign students especially Indian  and chinese are here to make money and they don't come here to create jobs or create intelligent kids to save United States. It's a shame that United States as a great country can't control such frauds from taking advantage of this system. Please do a thorough investigation on such people and make OPT rules strict to prevent such malpractices by consultancies. \n\nIt is also important to save American jobs for American people. I would like to recommend that any employer should call foreign graduates only after they have interviewed a specific number of American candidates to make sure that the priority is  given to American citizens.  Please do the needful to stop these fraud Indian consultancies. Rather than giving OPT visas to all students who graduate here in USA, you should implement a system where  students with good academic credentials directly benefit from  system. Those who fake their credentials should be punished by cancelling the OPT and deporting them back to where they came from. \n\nPlease strictly enforce OPT visa holders to work in their corresponding fields they have their degrees based on. Recently, I have noticed that many of the mechanical engineering grads started working with these IT consultancies with fake profile and fake experience. Please take necessary steps to avoid such issues in future. Please stop them from changing companies during the OPT period. This will make sure that those who fake resumes to join a company will pay the price eventually. Stop graduates working with fake experience and taking away American jobs!! \n\n\nTo avoid faking resumes and profiles by these con artists, I hereby request  DHS to enforce background check rules on these candidates before they even start their jobs. If you don't take care of concerns raised by American workers like me eventually this rule will be thrown out by another judge in the court. So I hope you'll address my concerns to implement a strong rule to avoid such fraudulent activities by foreign graduates and Indian consultancies. \n\n\nGod Bless United States of America!", "confidence": "99.8774", "result": "Negative", "author": "Thomas Hayden"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2597": {"commentText": "       Any post university training program should not last longer than one year total. Any longer and it becomes employment. The proposal would make it possible to have a three year training, plus the potential for an additional two years if earning a second STEM degree at a higher education level\nThe safeguarding for US workers in related fields is extremely weak in the proposal. In fact, since the requirements are so low, they actually promote the hiring of OPT trainees instead, for which companies can pay \"trainee\" type wages (minimum wage). How could a US Citizen or Permanent Resident recent graduate expect to compete for this position while saddled with student debt?\nThe costs of the standards in the proposed rule of approximately $71.7 million dollars per year to facilitate the OPT 24 month extension could be much better allocated in the form of full scholarships to US citizens and Permanent residents to study in STEM fields reducing the US reliance on foreign labor in particular in fields of sensitive technology for national security reasons.\n       There is a terrible trend occurring. To illustrate, three Michigan Universities alone (U of M, MSU and Wayne State) provided close to a billion dollars in aid, tuition and teaching assistantships to foreign students in 2011. US and Permanent Resident students attend undergraduate classes and pay tuition that is then often redistributed to foreign grad students who have no student debt in the form of free tuition or teaching assistantships or other support. Only a small body of US citizen and permanent resident students graduate debt free and have the means to continue to grad school. There then exists a gap for which employers look to foreign labor to fill. \nInstead of helping the problem, the proposed rule will only make this cycle worse and hurt US Citizen and Permanent Resident students. The proposed rule will increase the number of foreign students applying to the universities (as appears to be one of the stated goals of the proposal), with the ultimate goal to obtain a job in the US. However, in consequence US Citizen and Permanent Resident students will be forced to attend lesser schools due to availability and competition, and face greater competition for work when they do graduate.\n        Any proposed rule should not be at the expense of those who are citizens and permanent residents.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\n\n- There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\n\n- OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n- \"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\n\n- the proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\n- \"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\n- \"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\n- \"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\nProfessor Norm Matloff of UC Davis:\n\n- On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.\n\n- Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.\n\n- If the U.S. indeed \"needs\" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?\n    \n- If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?\n    \n- OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.\n\n\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Mike Lutman"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3337": {"commentText": "I think this proposal is another slap in the face to natural born citizens!!

I also have arguments why the rule is in the best interest of both the US workers and international students. My points are as follows:\n\n1) Several comments argued that the OPT extension increases competition for US workers. But anyone with an analytical mind will see that its actually the contrary. Research shows that every foreign-born graduate with an advanced STEM degree is associated with, on average, 2.6 jobs for American workers(link: https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/06/16/urgency-immigration-reform-attracting-world-s-best-and-brightest). A cultural trend in the country that I am coming from is that the top students in the class study in the STEM filed, and the best of them come to study abroad. Moreover, almost all the OPT students in my STEM field were valedictorians of their school in their home country. What I mean to say is that these STEM students are filtered after tremendous competition and therefore highly motivated, energetic and innovative. I have seen examples of several companies that were established based on an innovation by a STEM Ph.D. student that led to the employment of several natives.\n\n2) As a Ph.D. student in Circuit Design, I personally trained many undergraduate US students and guided them to accomplish their project. All of them have grown passion for the field and are hired by companies based on their circuit skills. A lot of my colleagues did the same to high school US students, some of whom later joined the STEM program. Therefore, the approach by DHS to educate international STEM students has both way benefits in complex ways that might not be immediately apparent.\n\n3) One might argue that OPT itself should be enough for all the benefits above, why do we need the extension? STEM fields are getting extremely complicated and even though the students have the capacity, its not possible to learn the practical aspects of the filed in school due to the lack of opportunities and time constraints. After hiring, generally it takes more than an year for the companies to train a student. So, if the OPT is not extended, then the student will have to leave the company as soon as he/she is ready to contribute. Therefore, I think that OPT extension is a smart approach by DHS to allow both parties enough time to benefit mutually from the relationship.  \n\n4) This point about the additional requirements in the extended rule. I think DHS aptly handled the issue of competition by demanding the commensurate status of the position. I also think that mentoring is necessary for OPT students to achieve their goal. But I think that the requirement of hard documentation for mentoring and training (paragraph no.: 80 FR 63387) should be relaxed. Please note that the training of STEM students is an automatic process guided by the success factor of both the company and the student. Most of the time, the training in industry occurs informally through discussions, design reviews and question answer sessions, which are hard to document. Since this is the first time most of the employers and also the DSO will encounter such review process, I suggest to allow back-and-forth communication between DSO and student/employer to determine whether the extension requirement is met. In other words, the the OPT extension request should not be rejected right away without allowing such negotiation about the training program.

It's spelled, I-L-L-E-G-A-L and it's exactly what these people are, so quit sugar coating it calling them Undocumented Immigrants. They are illegal and have no rights, privileges or protections under the Constitution of the United States and are not legal citizens. Start enforcing the laws that already exist. Deport them and if they want to re-apply for legal citizenship, let them do it legally. If the laws that are currently on the books had been enforced we wouldnt be in the predicament we are currently in. We dont need 11 million illegal immigrants in this country when unemployment is remains so high. This is also going to add to the healthcare dilemma as well as Social Security, Medicare, etc.. Before any new immigration laws are passed that will create an influx of illiterate immigrants a law has to be passed making English the official language of the United States. All of our ancestors came here and kept their customs and identities but they all learned English. They knew that in order to get ahead and be able to communicate with each other this was a necessity. The illegals that have recently come to this country dont appear to be as willing and this has created a major problem with education. Public education is guaranteed but the cost of interpreters needed to translate English into the immigrants native language isnt cost effective and causes a tremendous and unfair burden on current legal citizens and taxpayers. This is wrong and totally unacceptable. You have to look at the big picture and see what other problems this is going to create before you pass a bill thats only going to make matters worse than they are and cost the American taxpayers more of their hard earned money. Go to another country and see how far you get if you don't learn their language. Like Earl Pitts says, \"Wake up America\" before it's to late.\n     Furthermore, how ironic and despicable it is that you want to give Illegal Citizens rights they haven't earned and don't deserve while at the same time you want to take legal US citizens 2nd Amendment rights away. This also is not fair to former immigrants who came here and went through the legal process to become legal citizens. That is a big slap in the face and very unfair to them. Wake up, smell the roses and get your priorities straight.\n     First of all,greedy legal American citizens and corporations need to stop luring and exploiting illegal immigration by creating jobs, hiring and providing shelter and food. We also need an e-verify system to enforce this.    \n     Make it a Class A felony with mandatory minimum 10 years imprisonment to hire, rent, feed or offer shelter to illegal aliens that would rapidly help resolve the problem.

Secondly, OPT students are never been paid until and unless they get a contract job with the client and will be paid mostly on 70-30 percentage basis. What is this percentage basis? i will tell you suppose if a consultant gets a contract job with client and if he is paid 60 dollars per hour as a billing rate then the the consultant gets 70 % of it and consultancy gets 30% of it. Every consultancy says that consultant is paid on salary basis but no everyone are paid in percentage basis if he has a job he is paid if not no he will not be paid. I agree that some are genuine OPT students who does not do any unethical or illegal activity but the ration of genuine to fake/unethical students who utilize/mis-utilize OPT is 20%:80%. Whats the use of it and at whats costing USA for this i.e. agreeing to OPT rule will be no doubt mis-utilized. Faking at least 8-10 years of experience which is costing less number of jobs available to genuine people.

People in OPT can go for genuine full time jobs but they will not get as they don't have experience or will not be paid much so they will be told by all these INC consultancies that if they will fake their resume and do little hard work at client's location they will paid good money so almost every student opts for that.

Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)\nDocket ID: ICEB-2015-0002\n\nDear Chief Westerlund:\n\nAs an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in December, 2014 with a Master's degree in the field of Computer Science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. \n\nThe proposal to re-institute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. \n\nProviding more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.\n\nIn order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and accomplishing through experience. Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application.Establishing goals and a professional road-map at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished.\n\nGiven that the H-1B visa program is a common mechanism for F-1 students to transition to the U.S. work environment, cap-gap relief is essential to avoid gaps in work authorization between the April filing window and the October start date of the H-1B visa.\n\nDHS should minimize the potential impact on STEM students in the event a final rule does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 Interim Final Rule. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule-making. Therefore, the following options should be considered to best address STEM students already in OPT: First, any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet adjudicated prior to vacatur should be kept on hold until the new rule is in place. Second, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension. Third, a student in the 60-day grace period following initial period of OPT should be given the opportunity to apply for a STEM extension if the new rule takes effect during the student's 60-day grace period.\n\nMany opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.\n\nChanging temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.\n\nWith this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nVeera Paruchuri", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Veera Paruchuri"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2974": {"commentText": " I personally strongly agree with this amendment for OPT extension.

Im writing to express my complete support for extending the STEM OPT extension by 24 months. I briefly listed out the benefits of this new regulation from the perspective of international students, U.S. employers, and U.S. society in the following:\n\nFirst of all, this 24-month extension would give an immediate benefit on the international students who make up more than half of STEM advanced degrees earned at American colleges and universities, according to a study released on June 18, 2015. As we know that in order to continue working in U.S. beyond the OPT time period, the internationals need to get approved with a H-1B visa through the USCIS lottery which has a notoriously high failing rate of 51%. Without the 24-month OPT extension, more than half of international STEM students will be forced to leave the job occupations in U.S. This will not only hurt millions of international STEM students every year, but will likely have a great negative impact on the U.S. colleges and universities, because prospect international student enrollment will be hindered. If they knew that the country that they are going to earn a degree in is not supportive for their career development after graduation, why would they come to earn a degree here paying the expensive tuitions?\n\nSecondly, without the 24-month extension, the U.S. employers would lose millions of well-educated, high-skilled international employees with STEM degrees. It would result in a complete waste of the employers hiring effort and expense, training resources, and most importantly, a great reduction on their talent pool. A huge impact on the overall company performance is likely to be seen, therefore result in a great reduction on their overall productivity and revenue.\n\nLast but not the least, the U.S. society in general will benefit greatly from this new regulation. Diversity and equality are two of the most important factors that make U.S. a strong and beautiful nation today. With open arms to embrace the highly educated, top talent from all over the world, U.S. society will undoubtedly benefit greatly in all aspects including economy, science, technology, and developing even faster to reach a greater goal. It is the great talent that propels the advancement of technology and economy throughout human history. With more and more supportive regulations to encourage the top talent to contribute in U.S. society, U.S. will fly towards a brighter future with strong wings.\n\nThanks so much for your concern and time.\n\nSincerely,\nLaurie Zhang\nGraduate Research Assistant\nUniversity of Washington", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Laurie Zhang, University of Washington"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0186": {"commentText": "this extension will benefit U.S. a lot!

The immigration diversity helps this country attract a lot of top talent and it is also the reason that USA is and will keep the top 1 position in all the counties of world.\nAll of large successful industries,(for example, the spacecraft invention, the first landing on the moon, the internet technology, even the Hollywood movie industry and so on), are supported by a large group of obscure international people from STEM majors. For example, in lots of famous internet and technology companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple and so on, a large proportion of employees are international people.  These people lead the trend of technology and make a great fortune for USA.  They work hard in every industry & sector and contribute a lot to USA in their own way. They generate USA, and USA also generates them. This is why USA can continue attracting a lot of genius from world and remain its strong.\nAccording to statistics, the technology development in science and industry of USA in recent years is really in proportion to the increase of Tech immigration and international student number.  These international students study and master advanced technology skills in advanced universities of USA. Especially for those who have high level degrees, we have given them a lot of scholarship, we have spent a lot of money on them, so that we should give them more chances and let them make the most use of what they have learnt to contributes to USA. With their contribution, the technology and economy growth they produce will bring a lot of benefits. For example, more job opportunities will be created to USA. Besides, STEM students get things done, generate tax and pay social securities, which is also a kind of fiscal revenue for USA governments.\nNow a lot of companies can apply H1B visa for their international employees. However, unfortunately, there are still a lot of international graduate student cannot get H1B visa because of the limit number of H1B visa. These people have been trained at least one year in companies and have working experience. They have to go back to their homeland and use what they learned in USA to build their own country, which is really an enormous loss for USA. If USA can give these people OPT extension, they will have more chances to stay there and contribute to the development of USA. So, improving and expanding OPT will lead to a win-win situation. It has everything to gain and nothing to lose for USA.\nIn general, OPT extension brings lower cost and more resources for the technology companies. Next generation technologies will bring down the living cost for everyone and create more jobs for America! They are and will be making America greater! So, OPT extension is a good effort for USA to maintain our edge in science and technology.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Chen\n", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Alan Chen"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1763": {"commentText": "I strongly support the extension period of 24 months which would help the international student community to contribute to the American society,their share of knowledge gained by the education programs in the states.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\n\n\n\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):\n\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'\"\n\"After the GAO issued its report in 2014, I wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. I also asked that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. The Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, responded on your behalf to my letter. He said the Department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not.\"\n\"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.\"\n\n\nJohn Miano, attorney representing tech workers:\n\nthe proposed rule effectively \"requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.\"\n\"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.\"\n\n\nThe message from this Regulation is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "confidence": "99.9965", "result": "Positive", "author": "Joel Jamison"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-2009": {"commentText": "I am all for the OPT extension but there should be strict regulations with respect to fake resumes and proxy interviews and also on the job support.

STEM caught on, students rose to the occasion, parents and the broader community saw the value of the endeavor--that is until reports filtered back that recent;y graduating students couldn't get jobs using their STEM educations. That takes the incentive out of any project when a community invested in STEM learns that there are no, or not that many, jobs in STEM for all the students we are training and setting on that course.\n\nAs an educator with 50+ years experience at retirement, I see the STEM education initiative in K-12 schools, technical school and community colleges has gone the way of other initiatives I've watched and been apart of for the past five decades as an educator: first there's the hype, then the buy-in (coerced or otherwise), then the glut of students trained and pointed in that initiatives direction, then the market flooding, and finally the let down when graduating students can't find jobs in which to use that training. \n\nWhen we seek to prioritize a training, nationally, then we should support the job market, nationally, for those American students we've trained. Not to do so demoralizes, at the least, those whose focus has been turned to prepare themselves for that opportunity--including all stakeholders: students, teachers, parents, and often the wider community--who equally give themselves to the initiative's promise and potential.\n\nAs I see it, and historically, it has been a priority to educate American students for American jobs first and foremost. Please do not think here that I am pass in not recognizing the encroaching globalism, I  see it--but I think it should unfold organically, not by neglecting the people of this country and their needs in lieu of forcing its evolution: America's first responsibility should be to provide for its own citizens--and I think we have not done that by a long shot! That said, to my mind, this \"Proposed Rule\"would be an example of disregarding that foremost responsibility: Once our own citizens have their education and career needs met, as in preparing and obtaining jobs using their fanfare induced STEM training. Then and only then, if our largess is such that we can afford to extend services to students of other countries who come here for our superior education, who then opt to linger to take advantage of extended time to use that education in our marketplace, that could be an option, but only after our marketplace is saturated with American workers trained for those positions. \n\nThe example of companies such as Disney, although using a different government rule, to replace American worker's with foreign workers is just a prelude to what your Proposed Rule will do. It is at this point in time a further demoralization, destruction, and I make bold to add, demonization, of the American worker in the American workplace.

This restrictive policy helped make the United States the worlds preeminent technological power.\n\nThe current policy has a very different purpose.  It is to open the doors to unlimited immigration of people the majority of whom have (for their job classifications) average or below average ability.

As job prospects in science and engineering continue to stagnate and decline, more and more of the hardest-working and most talented Americans (including the descendents of recent immigrants) will gravitate to protected fields such as medicine.  There is nothing wrong with medicine attracting good people, but if only losers who cant get into medical school do science and engineering, well, how is that improving the quality of American science and engineering? \n\nImagine a big research university.  To improve it should both support current faculty and also work hard to recruit the best talent from outside.

Dumping an additional ten thousand engineers into a company that only has need for a thousand will NOT instantly cause this companys business income to grow enough to pay for them.  Thats ridiculous.

Not gonna happen.\n\nI strongly urge that we limit, instead of expand, the ability of foreign nationals to move here and take jobs from Americans, at all skill levels.

No doubt about this, if this proposal finally passed smoothly \nthen both STEM students and US will be really benefited from this OPT rules.\nDHS have done really good work within this short period of time.\n\nBut I want to highlight few points about this proposal where DHS should \nrethink to change little bit of proposal rules in few areas before prepare \na final rule to give a real sense of F1 OPT extension rules both for \nSTEM/NON-STEM catagory students to overcome the current H1B quota limitation \nproblem.\n\n1. I think that as per current OPT extension proposal, DHS intension is to \n   keep details track record about employees, employers and US university's, \n   so DHS can able to monitor every process in right track or not. But it \n   may be created a complexity to maintain the document from vice-versa. \n   So I am requesting to DHS, please try to find out easy documentation methods \n   which can be reduced the documentation over burden process for related \n   concerned sectors.\n\n\n2. Secondly my view is that current DHS OPT extension proposal have one\n   sided means they have extend 24 months OPT period only for STEM category.\n   It is no doubt that US need STEM people due to shortage of STEM manpower.\n   But non immigrant NON-STEM master degree holder like MBA want to contribute\n   their experience with vast experience after MBA to improve US economy\n   and revenue and also start their business in USA. But  they only get 12 months \n  OPT period after MBA  which is really very shortage time  to get H1B visa due to \n  unexpected smaller number of H1B quota as per current\n   manpower demand due to improvement of US economy. I know one person after\n   completed MBA from US university, now he have started business in Canada,\n   because he was unfortunate guy not able to pick up H1B visa due to lottery\n   system method.\n\n   Although current non-stem degree holder like MBA can enjoy 24 months OPT\n   extension as per current OPT proposal rules provided if he/she have done \n   STEM degree from US university before MBA and also OPT extension must \n   previous stem degree related. In reality, most of the MBA students will \n   like to work in Management segment to work with their analytic mind and\n   complex business solution problem. On the other side, very few international\n   students have done BS/MS in stem from US university before MBA. If we see the \n   statistics about international MBA profile in USA, then we will see most of \n   the international students have done their stem degree from their home country \n   and after 4-5 years practical experience in various industry, they take an \n   admission in MBA in US university to contribute expertise of their experience in \n   business management area as well as to get global business exposure or analytic \n   in management or start their business in USA and ultimately US economy will get\n   benefit.\n\n   So my request to DHS if they allow at least to non-us stem degree holder to get an\n   opportunity for 12 months OPT extension if 24 months is not possible then they \n   can contribute their experience what they have learned from us business \n   school to US companies for 1 year more and increase their chance to get H1B visa \n   for second time.\n\n   At last we want to say that please consider my above points and draw a final proposal\n   so nobody will be deprived from this OPT extension opportunity and it will be real\n   sense of immigration change to some extent until & unless H1B quota is to be increased.\n   and also must monitor no american employees will be effected from any types abuse \n   from this proposal. \n  \n   With Thanks & Regards\n\n  Swapan Mukherjee\n\n\n   \n   \t  ", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Swapan Mukherjee"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1282": {"commentText": "\nI appreciate the validity and effectivity of extending OPT period by 24 month.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.\nThere are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.\nOPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.\n\"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.\"\nthe proposed regulations are \"irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.\"\n\"U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000.\"\n\"DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.\"\n\"If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate.\"\n\"It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.\"\n\"It's an over-reach to claim that someone who completes a master's degree in as little as 12 months needs three years interning -- at low or no pay in many cases -- to get further training.\"\nthe worker protections included in the new rule \"are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.\"\n\"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.\"\n\"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money.\"\n\n\"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.\"\n\nCompanies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas.\n\n By Definition There Are No Similarly Situated U.S.Workers Ensuring That No One Will Meet This Definition So The Employer Can Never Be Liable For Replacing Any U.S. Worker.\nThis Regulation is designed to leave the U.S. worker unprotected because by definition there are no Similarly situated U.S. workers thus, giving the employer an excuse/alibi to replace all U.S. workers with imported foreign student.\n\nthe message form this Regulation is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.", "confidence": "100.0000", "result": "Positive", "author": "Clifford Stephens"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0835": {"commentText": "I strongly support this proposal base on the following opinions:\n\n1. Benefits to the U.S. economy.\n\nU.S. has been the #1 country in the world for years, and one of the main reasons of this success is because of its diversity.\n\nEver since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, technology innovation has become a key factor of determining a countrys place in the world, and U.S. sure grabbed this gist. This country draws talented people in by its world-class working and living environment, and pay them back with its welcoming and open mind. It brings people from different parts of the world and cultures together to do great things. There are immigrants contributing to almost every industry: IT, space exploration, military, movie, medical field, etc., and a lot of them are on the top of their respective fields. To draw more talented people in and make this country stay competitive, extending OPT extension period for STEM students sure is a good way to provide more opportunities for international students to find a job and transit to H1-B visa in order to use the knowledge they learned from U.S. universities and contribute back to this country.\n\nAccording to a 2012 report from the Information Technology Industry Council(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/stem-report.pdf), the Partnership for a New American Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, research has found that every foreign-born student who graduates from a U.S. university with an advanced degree and stays to work in STEM has been shown to create on average 2.62 jobs for American workersoften because they help lead in innovation, research, and development., and this report only shows the value and job opportunities STEM students had been creating until 2012. In fact, according to another report(http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf), immigrants were founders of 18 percent of all Fortune 500 companies, many of which are high-tech giants. As of 2010, these companies generated $1.7 trillion in annual revenue, employed 3.6 million workers worldwide, and included well known companies like AT&T, Verizon, Google, United States Steel, Nordstrom, and so on. The value that STEM students have been and will be bringing to the U.S. economy and workforce is tremendous.\n\n(Reference: http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/always-demand-economic-contributions-immigrant-scientists-and-engineers)\n\n\n2. Benefits to the daily lives of American citizens.\n\nFirst and most important of all, STEM students create more job opportunities. More and more native-born workers get jobs and the ability to live a better life, which leads to a more health and stable society. As the growth of STEM related industries, other non-STEM industries will also experience a business booming caused by this growth. For example, the Yelp mobile app created a more direct way for information exchanging between businesses and customers and has been benefiting billions of businesses. In todays technology world, the influence of STEM industries are unignorable.\n\nIn a smaller picture, the influence of the growth of STEM related industries to our lives is obvious. They make our daily activities easier and do the things that could only be seen in Sci-Fi movies 50 years ago. Google Map, Tesla electric car, Yelp, Uber, those innovations have become so close to our lives that we cannot even imagine how people in the 80th live without these technologies. It has been a true life-changing experience thanks to the booming of STEM industries.\n\nLast but not least, STEM students make America a truly multicultural society. In this very land of freedom, people has a chance to be friends with people from other part of the world, try different food, learn different cultures. It is not only what makes this country attractive for talented people from all over the world, but also how it becomes the #1 country in the world, and STEM students are a very important part of it.\n\n\n\n3. Benefits to STEM students.\n\nSTEM students are eager to find a job in the U.S. after graduating from school. U.S. is the headquarter of innovations. Gaining industry-leading work experience could benefit their career and enhance businesses between U.S. and their home country. But as more and more STEM students coming in every year, the chance of winning the H1-B lottery becomes less and less. This leaves a lot of talented people no choice but go home. Extending OPT-Extension period could give them more chances to win the lottery and keep serving this country. For those highly competitive majors, this proposal could give those good-standing candidates more time to find a job so that their talent could have enough time to be discovered, and the companies could choose from best of the best.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this proposal is a win-win for both U.S. government and STEM students.

I would like one of you to explain to this citizen, whose family has been in this country since (at least) the 17th century, why you feel obliged to give these people free things that citizens have to pay out the nose to receive, like healthcare, education, housing, food.\n\nIt is incumbent upon you to represent the people already citizens of this country, stop pandering to illegals and stop telling us we need immigrants to fill jobs when there are, obviously, NO JOBS in this country for citizens or immigrants!  It's odd to me that American kids go in serious debt for their college educations and then can't find jobs when they graduate, but our colleges and universities are filled with foreigners from supposedly poor countries and you want us to believe we need these people to come here to fill jobs that could very well be filled by citizens, if only we could receive the necessary training!  Citizens first!\n\nMy daughter was born in Utah, lived there for 16 1/2 years; then we moved to Nevada, where she finished a year and a half of school and then went to college.

TO attract more international students and enable them to contribute to the society, the department of Homeland Security(DHS) announced an expanded list of science, technology, engineering, and math(STEM) designated- degree programs in 2012. There are several psychology programs that are eligible for the OPT extension. Currently industrial and organizational psychology is not officially on the list; however,as far as I know, all around America, this major is very research focused. It will be a big loss for both international students who majored in I/O psychology and the society if our international graduates lose the opportunity to contribute to the American scientific and social development with what we learned just because of the difference of several figures. There are much less international students majored in psychology compared to many other majors. Definitely, international students could bring in psychology multi-cultural insights and more education investment. There are 4 I//O program in Great New York Area now, which is I/O Psychology Program in NYU; Social/ Organizational Psychology program in Teachers' College, Columbia University; I/O Psychology Program in Baruch College, CUNY; I/O Psychology Program in Hofstra University. NYU has taken an initiative in changing the code of their M.A. in I/O psych from 42.2804 to 42.2799. and made it eligible for STEM OPT extension. With more and more international students studying in psychology, especially interested in I/O psychology, I think it's time to bring this problem to public's attention. \n\nI'd like reiterate the necessity of changing I/O psychology major code and make it eligible for OPT extension. \nFirst, it's unfair to claim supporting for research projects for OPT extension on one side, but on the other side exclude our major in list, which is a very research oriented subject.  Attached please find curricula from all four programs in I/O psychology. Almost all of our courses cover research methods, statistics, social psychology, and focus on theories in I/O psychology field. As an I/O psychology major student in hofstra myself, over 80% school works do with literatures, readings, studies and researches. Out of 43 credits required in this 2 years program, only 6 points are for internship training, which is obviously comparable to other STEM major. You can't deny I/O psychology is still much more research oriented though some programs also emphasize practical aspects. Both scientific and practical aspects are crucial for I/O psychology. They are not contradictory. Such a research oriented subjects should be included in STEM in terms of STEM's purpose and equality.\nSecond, because now I/O psychology is now only offering 12 months OPT extension, less and less international students are going to pursue higher degrees in I/O psychology. It definitely has an adverse impact on I/O psychology program development and research. Multicultural environment raises more research topic in workplace psychology research nowadays. America needs more researchers from different cultures to work on it. International students are the major source for this important I/O field. Please don't intimidate those who have a strong desire in I/O research by merely setting  limitations in their OPT. Extra OPT time will definitely attract more international students in I/O psychology field and even promoting other psychology programs' recruitment. This opportunities allows international students to gain more experience in I/O workplace and be more confident in their future career in I/O research. More internal researchers will only benefit I/O psychology development in the long round.\nNeedless to say, education investment from international students is a great incentive for higher education development. Considering most of I/O students are encouraged to get Ph.D degrees. Recruiting more international students will definitely refill the funding gap in current programs.\n\nI believe including industrial and organizational psychology major into STEM is both necessary and beneficial for the society and research development in America, while excluding it is a big loss for both American academia and society.

Americas most prominent and successful companies hire thousands of international STEM graduates from US universities. We provide a ton of value to the economy. Most of us stay on once our H1B visa gets selected in the lottery, and we provide a lot of long-term benefit to American companies.\n\n2. The H1B lottery has a low success rate. Not passing the STEM extension would give us only one attempt towards getting the visa. I didnt get selected in the lottery this year. By simple probability, we need at least three attempts to be guaranteed an H1B visa.\n\n3. The OPT STEM extension is a great way to attract the brightest minds from around the world to study at American universitiesvery few students would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to come study at American universities if it didnt guarantee at least 2.5 years of practical training at the end.\n\n4. International students like us are not stealing American jobs. I work for a top tech company as a Software Engineer, and I can tell you firsthand that it is extremely difficult to attract, hire and retain top STEM talent. There simply arent enough Americans who can do STEM jobs. Most, if not all international US university STEM grads who work here end up being successful in their career. This, in turn, creates a lot more jobs for Americans and internationals alike. If Im successful and bring a lot of value to my company, it will generate more revenue for the company, and they can use that to grow their organization. Therefore it is a win-win situation for everybody.\n\n5. As an engineer at a top tech company, I pay tens of thousands of dollars in tax to Uncle Sam every year. I also spend tens of thousands of dollars to live in the US. Not incentivizing us to stay in the country will only cause us to find greener pastures elsewhereI could get a job as a Software Engineer at a company abroad, and contribute to their economythis would mean loss of taxes to the US government, among other things.\n\n6. In President Obamas wordsMore fundamentally, the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are going through the process of immigrating legally. In theory, if I wanted to become an American citizen, I would need to wait 18.5 years(2 years for H1B, 11 years for Green Card, 5.5 years for citizenship). Compare this to ~6 years if you illegally walked across the US border.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would like for the USCIS to not only pass this rule, but also consider expanding H1B visa availability for STEM graduates of US universities. We were trained by your professors (most of whom were immigrants themselves), and we spent thousands of dollars coming to America to get access to opportunity and provide a lot of value in return. We need to bring reform to this broken immigration system. Highly skilled immigrant workers like myself should not have to struggle through the various hoops of the immigration system remain in this country.\n\nScripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a strangerwe were strangers once, too.

There are mainly three reasons. First, the graduated students with STEM degrees, especially those PhD degree holders, can make a lot of contribution to the economy and technology development of United States. These high educated group of people are the real talents that any countries hope to have and to employ. If US government does not allow their OPT extension, the US will lose too much.

If they can not continue to work in US, the government will totally lose these money. If these students go to the other countries, the US will lose more. Secondly, most of the projects in companies or in government can not be completed in only one year. If the employee with STEM degree has great performance on this project, but he/she has to stopped it, the company or the government has to recruit some other persons to replace the role of this great employee. Usually, it is hard to find someone who master the high-tech skills in a short time. Even if someone is found, the company will spend lots of money and time to re-train a new employee. I believe no company want to do like this. In order to keep the benefits of the company, especially those small high-tech start up companies, the US government should allow STEM degrees holder work for a longer time in US. Last but not the least, this rule will encourage more and more talents to come to US to contribute more to the society, otherwise, the US will lose its competitiveness to attract the talents.\n", "confidence": "99.7735", "result": "Positive", "author": "Anonymous"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0553": {"commentText": "I am strongly in favor of this rule.", "confidence": "65.6049", "result": "Negative", "author": "Jatin Malviya"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0552": {"commentText": "I think this rule can bring huge economic benefits and scientific benefits to United States, both the people and the government. On the other side, if the rule can not be passed, the sequence will be extremely terrible.Anyone can image that. \n\nFirst, international students come to US to pursue a high-level degrees since they are so smart and diligent and they want to bring new ideas and new fresh blood to US. This is why US is still the most developed country in this world. If US start to block smart and diligent people, I believe it is also the sign that United States starts to fall.\n\nSecond, international students bring huge direct economic benefit to US. US has the most famous and best universities in the world, but US has no enough students to fill up all the great universities and pay the high tuition. International students pay expensive tuition and living expense to support these famous universities in US. And most of them will leave United State after they finishing their education. So they are the perfect consumers who only bring a lot of money to US without selling any thing. If this rule became illegal, then students in other country would found that the US do not welcome international students. Lots of great US universities will start to fall and bankrupt. The consequence is extremely terrible. \n\nThird, competing is best way to inspire US citizens' work passion and keep US being the most developed country in this world. Everyone knows catfish effect, I know it has a lot pains and it seems bad. But the natural selection is alway the truth. International students all try their best to be an expert in their area and they just like catfishes who can spur the local students. And most of them will leave US after several years. So they will not actually rob job opportunities from American people, they are just completing some great projects and have some practice for US in their best years. Actually, most international students have some weakness in language and culture, so if the companies can find a qualified american citizen for the position, then international students will have no chance to beat american citizen due to the language and culture. International students can only find the jobs that have no qualified american candidates. If there is no international students to work for these companies, they may hire unqualified employees who may largely injure the competitive power of these companies, especially high-end technology companies. Also, if they have no chance to work for US, they have to go to other countries, and enhance the power of other countries. \n\n... there are many other reasons that this rule has to be passed, if people who can decide the result have enough foresight, they will pass this rule as soon as possible. \n\n", "confidence": "99.9999", "result": "Positive", "author": "Qing Lan, University Of Illinois at Chicago"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3198": {"commentText": "Every job in America should first be offered to Americans  .

This program creates indentured servants that drive wages down for American citizens and destroys working conditions for all people in America with a job.\n\nIndentured servants are individuals that do not have full rights, full protections, or capability to switch jobs as compared to US citizens/green card holders.  These indentured servants work at low rates, more than 40 hours per week, but only bill for 40 and take a ton of abuse from the hiring managers.  Having more than one class of employee in America hurts Americas and those American owned businesses who are more concerned with employing Americans than lowering costs by using non-American employees.\n\nThis program has similar negative effects as the horrible H1b program.  Indian owned companies have repeatedly sent me emails regarding open positions that specify that any candidates that I send them have to be H1b, and sometimes require only candidates on this program.  I can forward these emails to you.  This is unfair to every American, but mostly to the historically disadvantaged minorities in American as the hiring company can claim to have hired a \"minority\" for this position by hiring a non-American.  This program and the H1b program hurt African Americans the most!\n\nThis program is actually worse than the H1b program.  There are zero salary protections for people on this program, so the staffing industry can and do fully abuse them.\n\nWhy are non-Americans even allowed to comment on this legislation?  Aren't the laws and programs in America supposed to benefit Americans?  Do we make laws that determine which part of America to give away to other countries?  Is that who we are?\n\nI have personally hired five underemployed or unemployed Americans of various races and trained them to start their IT professional career.  Without the eradication of these programs, I will be unable to do this in the future as my cost to do this is the same or more than the total cost for my clients to bring in H1bs or candidates on this program.\n\nThis program is killing American jobs.  In fact, there are already too many non-American STEM candidates in America.  Every single day, I receive emails for placement firms' hotlist of available candidates.  There are hundreds of non-Americans in America currently unemployed.  Why are we adding more to directly compete with Americans?  If there is such a need for STEM trained employees in American, why have billing rates gone from over $150 per hour in the 1990s to under $50 per hour now for an expert?  On top of this, clients stopped paying for travel during this time period as well.\n\nMost companies now have an \"India first\" policy when staffing for projects or positions.  This means that all positions and projects are funded low in the expectation of staffing with H1b candidates or candidates on this program.  These companies all have H1b dependent vendors.  They try to source all staffing through these firms in order to get low rates.  This means that no Americans get these jobs due to these H1b dependent firms' racist preference for Indian employees.  I have never once seen an Indian employ an African American.  This program is essentially an unlimited source of additional candidates for these H1b dependent firms.\n\nI am an American Citizen.  I have worked hard the last 20 years to build my career and my company.  Please don't take that away from me.

The advantage of that is obvious even if it is a small part of US immigration laws and rules.\n\nFirst of all, international students are benefited for the important practical training after they graduate from college. This is one of the most important points which attract international students to pursue a US degree. Since many US companies in technical areas lead the world, practical experience in these companies becomes so valuable for new graduates and could make them competitive no matter they are going to stay in the US or go back to their home countries. I believe this is also a very important part for the US education system to make it competitive internationally. If the function is disabled, pursuing US education become much less appealing and less convincing, comparing to other education systems such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. Students will lose their confidence for US education.\n\nAlso, the demand of professional high-tech worker is increasing, which can be directly seen from the sharp increase of the H1B visa applications year by year. Companies are facing a situation that it is more and more difficult for them to hire enough technical workers. So it is hard to understand the request to stop and revoke the OPT extension rule. One of my friend was reached by more than 10 companies and national labs for opening even before his real graduation because they are lack of people with required technical knowledge and skills to work for them. This means the demand for professional high-tech workers and researchers is huge and urgent. If the work authorization can be extended and become more stable, employers can have more candidates to fill their positions and serve for them efficiently. This will definitely help the employers in the related technical industry to stay efficient and competitive in the globalized markets.\n\nThen for the cost issue, I do not think the STEM OPT rule is costly comparing to the potential benefit from it. As far as I know, many US companies especially in the IT industry are acquiring and hiring professional workers directly from the other countries due to lack of candidates in the US. Actually this is an expensive way with low efficiency. But I think the companies have no other choice because they cannot find enough candidates within the US graduates. The extension of STEM OPT may help them to attract more international students with the suitable skills to work for them. Furthermore, the OPT extension becomes very helpful as a buffer area for the H1B lottery competition to avoid potential interruption to the companies and their new internationally employees.\n\nIn general, I think to keep or to improve the STEM OPT extension rule is necessary and beneficial for not only the international students in the STEM area but also the US technical companies, US education system, and even the US economy. So I support to improve or to keep the STEM OPT extension rule.

I recommend this time period because the nature of the work of the STEM students, especially students in the Engineering field. For example, students who work in Civil/Environmental/Electrical/Mechanical Engineering industry, will often be involved in projects that need years to be completed. In most cases the students' participation in these projects will be required from the initial design phase to the construction/execution phase as well as the measurement and verification phase. It's very common that a construction project will take 10 years to be completed. 3 years is far from enough for students to gain meaningful experience, achieve actual real results and make real contribution to the companies/organizations; since the initial training would take up a long time. It will be a waste of resource and time for both the companies and students if the students have to leave when the project just started and the students just have gotten familiar with the industry and the operations of the companies. The short of enough practice time is also a factor that lower the competitiveness of international students in the job market, since the employer would not want to invest in training employees that only have very limited amount of time here in the companies. To conclude, in order to achieve the the goal of OPT - giving international students the opportunities to gain real, meaningful, valuable training experience as well as bringing actual benefit to the U.S. companies, I think OPT for STEM students should be extended for 3 more extra years, making a total 6 years training period. \n\nThank you,\nQiuhua Lu", "confidence": "99.9666", "result": "Positive", "author": "Qiuhua Lu"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-3427": {"commentText": "A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:\n\nOPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and\nOPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nIts time to eliminate the OPT program, not expand it.", "confidence": "99.9626", "result": "Positive", "author": "William Scout"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-0365": {"commentText": "I am happy to hear that the OPT extension will be extended to 24 months.It will both benefits me and US a lot. \n\nFirst, OPT extension itself is necessary to allow F-1 student enough time to sharpen their skills and benefit US.  Without extension, I only have 12 months to stay in US. This means once I am familiar with the work, my deadline is just there.  Once I am ready to create more value for US, I have to leave. Of course, I can apply for H-1 B to stay longer. But,  I will graduate this December 2015 and if I want to stay in US after that 12 month, the best way is to find a job with H-1 B sponsor before April 2016(Because there is only one chance to be selected in H1B every year), and I only have one chance with 12 month. This means I only have 3 months to find such job after my graduation and if I fail to find the sponsored job before April, I do not have any extra chance to apply for H1B.  This might have several consequences. First, I might  not have motivation to work so hard for that company, because I know it does not matter how hard I work, I can not work for that company longer once my OPT is due. Second, the company need to waste a lot of money hiring new people and training them. The thing needs to be pointed out is that these new hired people might also be F-1 students, and thus it is a bad cycle for the company because once the new people is ready for the work, they might need to go because of limited OPT. Therefore, if OPT is short, both students and companies can be in an unstable situation, this is not good for the US economy. \n\nSecond,24-months extension is better than 17 month extension. The objective of OPT Extension is to allow most intelligent , most skillful ,and most useful student have opportunity to stay in US sharpen their skills and devote to US. Then why not giving these  satisfied students more time? If they are not good enough, they will be eliminated naturally;but if they are good, why not being more generous to them and giving them more time to show their value and let you know they deserve?Every stem student in US is not only spending a lot of money in US, but also always has skills you want. They always worked so hard in their home country to be outstanding enough to get the offer in US university. They are prepared for the world and can be shining in every country. Then why you do not take this advantage to use them? \n\nThird, with more extension,students can find a career without considering too much about the due day of their OPT. If OPT is not long enough, students have to consider too much about their status,because before they have enough experience, the status crisis is already around the corner. This means they might have to accept a company they do not want only if the company agrees to give them status. This always means students can not show their biggest value in that company.\n\nPlease give more time to F-1 Stem Student.

For what specific purpose is this program being proposed?\n\n3. How will this proposed program effect the unemployment rate of the American-born workforce (previously defined above)?\n\n4. How will this proposed program effect the American-born college graduate trying to gain employment, at a pay level that allows a higher-than-average quality of life, and still pay the debt of a college degree, or degrees?\n\n5. Since there is much talk about the 'Student Loan Bubble', please provide specific details that explain how this program will effect this potential issue?  As you may already know, if the USA has one more down-turn in the economy, considering it's still frail recovery, many of the student loan institutions (e.g. Sallie Mae, ACS and National Education, etc.), will necessarily either be 'rescued' by the federal government, using Real-American's tax dollars, or go out-of-business due to bankruptcy.  Why would the any branch of the American government put a program like this up for consideration?\n\n\nPlease Advise in Detail,\n-Brian", "confidence": "99.7094", "result": "Positive", "author": "Brian Hoffman"}, "ICEB-2015-0002-1631": {"commentText": "I think extending the STEM for OPT students is a helpful idea.

OPT extension will help international students who are taking advantage of using OPT keep their life in plan. If it terminated, most of people life and career plan will be heavily interrupt.\n2. Students who are using STEM OPT have all taken US high-level education, many of them has master or PHD degree, these intelligences are good quality work forces in STEM industries, they are creative, highly educated. In the future, they will definitely have more contributions to US STEM industries, build their own startups, create more working opportunities for the whole US society.\n3. STEM OPT is only a small part of foreign working permits. H1B, of course, is the largest visa for international workers. However, it has been abused by many outsourcing companies. They support foreign workers to apply multiple H1B at once. These make large number of foreign workers enter US job market and unfair to people who studied, working and living in US.

More and more STEM students are applying for h1b right now, which makes it much harder to be chosen than a few years ago when 17-month extension came out. So I think it is reasonable to change that old rules and extend OPT time to 24 months based on current trend.\n\n(2) We international STEM students make a grate contribution to American engineer field. This can be proven by the percentage of international students and works in STEM field both in industrial field and on campus. What impact will be if more than half of us have to leave this country because of the reclaim of STEM extension rules? Do you think places like silicon valley can still function well?\n\n(3) We have already sacrifice a lot to achieve STEM degrees so we deserve better. Not to say other degrees are easier but we STEM students do spend more of our times on endless homework and   projects. We even need to sharp our skills during leisure times. Otherwise we may not get a good GPA because the tests are so hard. These takes us too much times on finding a job or an intern. So we need more time after we graduate to make up the lost time.\n\n(4) We STEM need more time to gain experience in industry field. For STEM students, if you want to do a good job in industry, you have to spend hours and hours for practicing in real industry. Only after that, can we really improve ourselves.
